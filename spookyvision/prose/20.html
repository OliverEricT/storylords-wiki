<p>
	Things had settled for Kayla S. Hunter recently at Marshall University. The routine had crept back into her life thanks to finals week and she had lost track of the mystery of the city buried beneath the town housing an ancient temple to cthonic dieties beyond all recognition or understanding that was being run by the secret cult leader mayor of town and his secret cult is bent on the extermination of all life on the planet and their own ascension into godhood - you know, like you do. Life gets in the way sometimes, you know? She would get to it, get off her god damn back jesus!
</p>
<p>
	On this particular Friday morning she was sitting in her big comfy secondhand chair in her small, cramped, secondhand office, grading papers for the end of the semester and trying her hardest to get ready for the next one at the same time.
</p>
<p>
	That’s right kids, the exciting and fulfilling life of a teacher! All the pressures of corporate work, babysitting psychopaths, AND convenience store clerk levels of gun danger plus absolutely dogshit pay on top of it! It’s not like it’s shaping the minds of literally everyone who’ll ever make decisions for us in the future or anything! It’s definitely not the most important lynchpin job of our society or whatever! Sign up today! Fuck you!
</p>
<p>
	Extreme bitterness aside, Kayla looked up from her stack of poorly documented and even more poorly written historical architectural design essays to her brand new assistant across the room. “Have you gotten the revisions done on next semester's syllabus like I asked you to yet? It’s been three hours.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh no no, I’m writing Reader X Kayla Hunter fanfiction right now, I haven’t had time. In this one you and the reader go on a romantic late night museum trip and end up fistfighting a SUPER spooky living dinosaur skeleton, isn’t that RAD?!” Myrtle Smellie answered back, bobbing her head up and down in a frantic nod to agree with her own statement - all possible after her little nearly full decapitation whoopsie in her last appearance thanks to a medical neckbrace she had tied off tight around the open bloodless wound below. She’s kind of a weird zombie now or something? I don’t fucking know, I don’t write this shit.
</p>
<p>
	“Are you more a queening type of lady or a pegging type?” Myrtle asked, furiously typing on her laptop.
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t know what any of the words you just said to me mean, could you please just do the god damn job I HAD to hire you to do for like FIVE FUCKING MINUTES?!” Kayla groaned out loud, rubbing at her temples with both hands to try to massage the reality she was forced to live in to go away.
</p>
<p>
	“What job? Assistant monster slayer? Cause I’m READY TO ROCK - RIGHT NOW!” Myrtle leapt up out of her seat and began kicking at the air and making those Bruce Lee noises that everyone makes when they’re really kung-fu-ing hard, you know the ones. Fuck yeah.
</p>
<p>
	“Look… look…” Kayla again groaned out under her breath, switching to rubbing the bridge of her nose instead. The headache didn’t go away since it had human form and was doing the pose from Karate Kid on top of a chair in the middle of her office now, but every little bit helped. “I just… I just need the syllabus revisions. You’re my teacher’s assistant when we’re here, that’s the cover I was forced into so you wouldn’t go tell everyone I tried to cut your head off with a sword cane. You came up with it and yet you haven’t done ANY assisting since you plopped your gross decaying ass down in here.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m not decaying!” Myrtle cried out, offended. She slowly got down on her hands and knees on the desk and dangled her foot off the side of it to try to reach the ground, kicking at it futility for a few seconds before finally gaining purchase with the toe of her shoe. She then carefully slid off the desk into a standing position, back straight she dusted her dress off officiously. “I’m perfectly preserved because of the rituals I underwent when my cult… I mean… THE cult I’m not in anymore… was preparing me for ascension.”
</p>
<p>
	“Sacrifice.” Kayla corrected, her eyes back down on the student work she was grading, losing interest in talking to Myrtle completely by this point.
</p>
<p>
	“Potato, Tomato!” Myrtle snapped back, shoving her hands into her dresses pockets. “Hey did I tell you my dress has pockets!?”
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah about a thousand times now.” Kayla didn’t even look up.
</p>
<p>
	“....well it does.” Myrtle said in return, a little hurt sounding.
</p>
<p>
	KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK
</p>
<p>
	A sudden loud rapping at the door sent both of them bolt upright, all eyes turning towards it. Kayla glanced over at Myrtle who shrugged in return which caused her to grit her teeth in raging frustration.
</p>
<p>
	“YOU make my appointments, Myrtle! Who the fuck is this?” Kayla whisper-screamed.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh fuck if I know.” Myrtle said back, not even bothering to whisper. “By the way some guy has been calling you for three days now about a job offer or something with some old associate of yours. I didn’t write it down because it sounded lame. And nothing lame goes into my RADICAL Lisa Frank Trapper Keeper!”
</p>
<p>
	“God I hope he calls back, I’m ready to quit and drain septic tanks even…” Kayla grimaced under her breath before looking back to the door and yelling out, “Come on in, it’s open!”
</p>
<p>
	The door was flung open then, at full force, the heavy wooden structure hitting a metal filing cabinet behind it and rattling against it. In the door way stood two men - one relatively short, perhaps 5’4” or 5’5”, wearing a completely white suit, complete with tie, shoes, and a wide, flat-brimmed fedora which shaded his eyes - though he was also wearing a pair of black sunglasses underneath them. He carried in his right hand a cane -perfectly fitting for his size, wide and blunt, with a gemstone set in its handle, which he leaned on quite heavily.
</p>
<p>
	The other man was gargantuan - standing easily seven feet tall or more, and was wearing a strange white veil and mask over his face which only showed his eyes beneath - dark black and inky staring with a sort of malice from within the darkness that was absolutely palpable at a glance. He was dressed in a gigantic brown overcoat, which was tied snugly shut to the point it was impossible to see what else he was wearing. His hands were deeply hidden within the pockets of his overcoat. His breathing, slow and heaving, could be visually clocked, almost like a caged animal.
</p>
<p>
	“Good morning.” the small man hissed out, tipping his fedora like even more of a tiny creepy incel in greeting. “You may call me Mr. Cornwallis. This is my associate, Mr. Nero.”
</p>
<p>
	The gigantic man, whose head reached above the admittedly huge wooden doorframe, simply nodded. The completely human gesture was actually kind of relieving to see from him, given his animal-like glare and countenance.
</p>
<p>
	“Uh… alright. Do you have an appointment?” Kayla eyeballed the both of them over. They seemed human enough. For now. She did prop up her own cane against her desk within arms length though, just in case.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m afraid not. But you will want to hear what we have to say, I assure you.” Mr. Cornwallis grinned, taking a handkerchief from his breast pocket and dabbing around his thick neck. “You can spare the time.”
</p>
<p>
	“Now lookie here, you lil pipsqueak ass RUNT, “ Myrtle yelled as she leapt from the center of the room to stand just in front of them, placing her hands on her hips and puffing her chest out. Ironically she was looking the guy like square in the eyes because they were pretty much the same height. Sorry Short Kings. “Ms. Hunter ain’t got time for your HORSE SHIT SHENANIGANS. So go online and make an appointment to meet with her that I’ll definitely forget to tell her about like everyone else!”
</p>
<p>
	Kayla grinned, sitting back in her chair. Maybe this was a good decision after all.
</p>
<p>
	“Ah… the failed disciple.” Mr. Cornwallis said, shaking his head ruefully. “It would be a shame if it were to get out that you’re a few ligaments away from completely losing that loud, obnoxious head of yours, wouldn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
	Mr. Nero snorted a heavy laugh from beneath his mask, glaring down at Myrtle as he did.
</p>
<p>
	“What the fuck?! How do you know about that?” Kayla sat forward in her chair again, grabbing the sword cane next to her and holding it down behind the desk at the ready. “Who are you?”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh good, you’re ready to talk. Step aside.” Mr. Cornwallis motioned Myrtle away from the door, and for her part she looked back at Kayla, who nodded for her to follow his orders. She did, reluctantly, and even blew as raspberry in his face as she did. “Vexing...” he retorted.
</p>
<p>
	Myrtle ran around behind Kayla’s desk to join her and the two men stepped inside of the room, the gargantuan Mr. Nero having to bend down under the door facing to fit through. The massive man then grabbed the door handle with three fingers daintily and pushed it closed with a small click, before both men turned toward the ladies.
</p>
<p>
	Mr. Cornwallis had a seat in the lone metal chair that was meant for guests to the office, and crossed one leg over the other, fanning himself with her handkerchief.
</p>
<p>
	“We are representatives of The Acolytes of The Third Birth.” Mr. Cornwallis stated blandly, both Kayla and Myrtle being taken aback by the bluntness in fact. But neither responded, so he continued, “We were sent here with… an offer let’s say. That’s one way of putting it.”
</p>
<p>
	Mr. Nero snorted a laugh again, but held it back from a full guffaw as before. Mr. Cornwallis smirked widely at this reaction, but continued undeterred.
</p>
<p>
	“We have been sent to offer you amnesty from our people. We are a legitimate religion and wish to be treated that way. You and your… little dead cronie here.” He thumbed at Myrtle who threw him the double bird and HARD. He shook his head, “Your terroristic acts of vandalism, destruction, and religious persecution have vexed us beyond reasoning and we wish for it to end. We are offering you an out. You can walk away from your investigations and your meddling, and leave our people alone… and live a normal, happy, fruitful life. We will no longer send our agents to pacify your efforts if there are no more efforts.” He smiled, adjusting his sunglasses on his face.
</p>
<p>
	“Legitimate religion? Terroristic acts?! Religious persecution?! Are you out of your fucking little mind, you weird ass gross little Mogwai looking gremlin man?” Kayla growled out, standing up from her chair and raising the cane in her hand up to punctuate each we she said at them. “You’re a death cult bent on bringing forth some kind of Warp Digivolved angel/Cthulu mix and killing off all of humanity! You’re not fucking Quakers! Are you people even more out of your minds than I thought?!”
</p>
<p>
	Mrs. Cornwallis and Nero exchanged glances, the giant of the two shrugging at the little guy, who shook his head in return. Both looked back at Kayla with even-tempered stares.
</p>
<p>
	“You misunderstand your situation, Ms. Hunter. This proposition is either a friendly parting of ways or we will rip you limb from limb and devour you piece by piece until there isn’t even a drop of blood for the police to find.” Mr. Cornwallis said plainly, without even changing his facial expression. Not that the police would every do anything meaningful or useful to society anyway because they’re a bunch of worthless pigs, fuck 12.
</p>
<p>
	“What the hell?” Kayla said, grasping onto the hilt of her cane sword and beginning to yank it out of its scabbard.
</p>
<p>
	Mr. Cornwallis raised a hand to stop her and she did indeed stop, trying the thinking-before-acting thing she had been trying to drive into Myrtle’s brain for a week now.
</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately that lesson hadn’t quite landed yet and Myrtle was hurdling over the desk into a dropkick toward the smaller of the duo, screaming “FUCK YOUR SHIIIIITTT!” at the top of her lungs as she did.
</p>
<p>
	Within the blink of an eye she was dangling upside down, her hair swaying underneath her and her eyes wide with surprise. The gigantic Mr. Nero’s hand was wrapped around her entire calf, holding her five feet off the ground and eyeing her with a look of disgust in his eyes. “The apostate will cease her pointlessly stupid attack.” He said in a deep, solemn voice.
</p>
<p>
	Mr. Cornwallis looked back to Kayla and waved his hand to motion her to lower her cane. She did as he said, cursing the fact she didn’t get a normal teaching assistant who would bone freshmen and sell weed out of the back of the class.
</p>
<p>
	“Let her go, and we’ll talk.” Kayla said, as sternly as she could manage with so little control of the situation.
</p>
<p>
	“Fine, fine.” He waved his hand over his shoulder at Mr. Nero, who dropped the girl directly onto her head.
</p>
<p>
	Myrtle yelped and scrambled up to a seated position to frantically check to make sure her head was still attached. She sighed in relief and shook her head, “Almost lost my head over that one!” No one in the room even acknowledged her. She drooped her shoulders. Maybe she would say it later once everything had cooled down and everyone would get it.
</p>
<p>
	“You see, Ms. Hunter, we aren’t normal Acolytes. We are Clerics of the Umbralborn, who have feasted on not only the blood of an angel, but also the flesh. We have ascended beyond the mindless, even beyond the human - we are akin to Heaven itself - the larvae that will one day become angelic.” Mr. Cornwallis smiled with serenity as he spoke, leaning back in his chair with pride.
</p>
<p>
	“We have been chosen for this mission, especially.” Mr. Nero stated plainly.
</p>
<p>
	“Mr. Nero and I were ascended beyond humanity very specifically, Ms. Hunter. We were gifted with the tools necessary in this bodily form to hunt a very specific prey. That is to say - you. We are a new breed - the Hunter Hunter.” Cornwallis grinned, showcasing a row of shark-like razor sharp teeth behind his lips.
</p>
<p>
	“You mean like the anime?” Myrtle piped up, causing everyone else in the room to look at her, confusion dawning on their faces. “Yeah, it’s a manga also, hold up…”
</p>
<p>
	The entire conversation ground to a halt as she picked up her backpack from the corner of the room, unzipped it, and dove in with both arms to rummage around. Cornwallis and Nero exchanged awkward glances and Kayla tried her best to think of some kind of gameplan to get past them or kill them or anything other than learn about another anime from Myrtle. Or the limb from limb thing they said earlier, whatever.
</p>
<p>
	“A-hah! Here it is!” Myrtle yanked a small paperback copy of Hunter X Hunter volume one out of her backpack and held it up toward the ensemble. “Hunter Hunter!”
</p>
<p>
	“No, no, that clearly has an X in the title! It’s Hunter ECKS Hunter, it’s not the same!” Mr. Cornwallis snapped, feeling his time was being wasted on purpose now.
</p>
<p>
	“In Japan you don’t pronounce the X in titles! It’s like Spy Family! It’s not Spy ECKS Family!” Myrtle snapped, waving the book at them like it proved her point.
</p>
<p>
	“That doesn’t make any sense.” Mr. Nero said plainly.
</p>
<p>
	“They called it Mega Man X for the Super Nintendo though.” Kayla piped in, confused about the situation herself.
</p>
<p>
	“NO no no! That’s different! It’s not in the middle of the name!” Myrtle was getting increasingly annoyed, pointing at the X in the middle of the title Hunter Hunter on the front of the book.
</p>
<p>
	“Why would it be different in one and not the other?” Mr. Cornwallis snapped, getting a bit incensed at the conversation.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s a different medium!” Myrtle yelled, exasperation in her voice.
</p>
<p>
	“ENOUGH! That’s not why we’re here!” Mr. Nero shouted, pounding his fist into the top of the filing cabinet by the door - which caved in down to the bottom drawer from the force. Everyone stopped yelling and turned back to him.
</p>
<p>
	“HEY! I have important files and shit in there!” Kayla screamed out. She assumed she had important files in there anyway, the previous head of the department probably put stuff in there.
</p>
<p>
	“We will give you one final chance to forget everything you know about the Acolytes of the Third Birth, Kayla S. Hunter.” Mr. Cornwallis stated bluntly. “Or we will kill you and the apostate here and now.”
</p>
<p>
	While everyone had been paying attention to the loud destructive outburst of the massive Mr. Nero, Myrtle has silently slipped past the two of them out into the hallway, a feat that Kayla only caught the tail end of, seeing her disappear around the corner of the doorframe.
</p>
<p>
	For her part, Kayla spoke up loud, trying to draw attention to herself, “And if I don’t?!” she yelled, grasping her sword cane tighter for effect.
</p>
<p>
	Mr. Cornwallis and Mr. Nero exchanged glances again before looking back to her. “.... We’ll kill you. I literally just said that, didn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
	BRRRRRRIIIIIINNNNNGGGGGG
</p>
<p>
	The fire alarm blared to life, startling everyone in the room to alertness immediately. The two Acolyte Clerics turned their eyes away from Kayla to the hallway long enough for her to leap onto the desk and bound off of it through the air, unsheathing her silver bladed sword cane in the meantime. A quick swipe of the blade as she passed Mr. Nero and she was re-sheathing it once again in the hallway as she slid to a stop near the lockers across from the door, a wide grin on her face.
</p>
<p>
	Mr. Nero turned to face her, a long gash in her overcoat over his left arm. But beneath it… only a small mark across what looked like a blackened carapace beneath it. He grunted a rueful sound turned his gaze to Mr. Cornwallis.
</p>
<p>
	“....oh very well. Negotiations have failed, just as you said they would. No need to rub it in. Kill them quickly and minimize witnesses.” Mr. Cornwallis stated plainly, standing up from the chair in the office and leaning again on his own gem-topped cane.
</p>
<p>
	I said gem again in case you missed that I said gem earlier. I got that one. Also these two guys are the new Nemeses, if you’re too dumb to grasp that too, you big dumb bitch. Not you guys, the audience. And also not you specifically, audience member listening right now. You’re cool.
</p>
<p>
	Mr. Nero huffed in approval and turned back to the hallway. By this time Kayla had gotten back up to her feet and unsheathed her cane sword again. She wondered why she had resheathed it to begin with? To look cool? But for who? It’s not like there was an audience of people watching her performance and deciding if it’s cool or not, that’s ludicrous. This is an audio medium. That’s a twofer for fourth-wall breaking, for ya.
</p>
<p>
	Mr. Nero reached over to the gash in his overcoat and stuffed his long, gloved fingers into it, yanking it back and off of his body in one fluid motion - the fabric ripping apart from the force like paper - up the arm, down the side and around the back, until it simply fell away from his body onto the linoleum hall floor. His body revealed, he was covered in black spiky armoured carapace on almost every inch of his body - the plates overlapping and shifting as he moved, the spikes jagged and soaked in some strange purple liquid that seemed to singe the air as it touched it.
</p>
<p>
	He threw his gloves to the ground, revealing blade-sharp metallic fingers, edged along four sides and with a doubled jagged point at the tip of each finger - explaining just why he had been so careful not to show or do anything with his hands before. And then there was one final reveal - one jagged bladed hand grasping onto his veil and ripping it away, revealing a set of double mandibles where a mouth would be, chittering and flitting about around the dripping, vacuous maw beneath, and a secondary set of red, blood-shot, human eyes beneath his own, glaring viciously down at Kayla.
</p>
<p>
	Now any normal person would shit and piss and run in that order, but Kayla wasn’t a normal person - so she just fucking ran. You see, normally a silver blade not only cuts into one of these Acolyte horrors, it also burns at them like acid, usually killing them in a few strikes - but this one? It didn’t even leave a noticeable mark. The idea of testing out another strike to see if it was a fluke struck Kayla as perhaps foolish - hence the quick exit.
</p>
<p>
	She ran full tilt, feeling the things breath on the back of her neck as she passed room after room, until she turned around the far corner of the hall and ran toward where Myrtle had ended up, standing next to a fire exit with a bright cartoonish smile plastered on her freckled face.
</p>
<p>
	“DID YOU KARATE EM TO DEATH?!” she yelled, but when Kayla ran past her and she heard the cacophonous drumming of massive footsteps coming behind, she decided she’d ask again later and just go ahead and run herself. She placed one hand on top of her loose head and started galloping full speed after Kayla.
</p>
<p>
	Mr. Nero swung one of his massive bladed hands through the corner wall of the hallway, sending a spray of stone, metal, and debris flying in every direction, his leaping chase closing distance just as Kayla and Myrtle managed to not be impaled by the sailing chunks of construction material. He roared out a hideous, inhuman sound, and slammed both blades into the ground, barely missing Myrtle’s body.
</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately for everyone involved, the weight of the rampaging bladed crab monster and his destruction of a supporting beam in his over-zealous attempt on their lives caused the entire hallway floor underneath them to collapse inward, both walls caving down after the fall - in a billowing sea of stone, wood, metal, and plaster - a virtual avalanche of building materials that threatened to bury all three of them alive underneath of it, should they be caught in it.
</p>
<p>
	But Kayla thought quickly, inspiration like a lightning bolt striking her at just the right moment. Myrtle had just about caught up to her when the floor began to give way, so she stopped running and grabbed her around her waist, holding onto her sword cane with her other hand. The wall came inward toward her like a literal ton of bricks, with a speed unlike anything she had seen before, but in the split-second where a decision had to be made, she made it. The wall next to her had a window. And that window was collapsing inward as well. So she adjusted her body and Myrtles as best she could, and jumped forward with everything her legs could give her - bashing through the glass and sending it raining like confetti through the air - and sending both of them into open air and out of danger.
</p>
<p>
	Mr. Nero bellowed after them as he was sucked down into the avalanche of destruction and buried beneath the rubble that was once the third floor of the Architectural Studies Building.
</p>
<p>
	But if you notice - I did say third floor. A thought that hadn’t occurred to Kayla when her fight or flight said jump the fuck out this window to get away from danger. The momentary elation of not getting murdered by the third floor of a building falling on you was cut painfully short when both Kayla and Myrtle, flailing their arms as hard as they could to match their high-pitched screaming, began falling those three stories toward the concrete Quad below.
</p>
<p>
	BAM! CRASH! BANG!
</p>
<p>
	Dr. Wiener’s Patented Corn Dog cart was crushed under the weight of two screaming women who just fell from the fucking sky - the canopy exploding into a million pieces and the cart being flung off it’s wheels and onto the ground - disgusting hot dog water exploding into the air like a fucking water park. The small group of customers waiting for their corn dogs were flung helter skelter in all directions from the force, Dr. Wiener himself flying backwards into a gigantic bush and getting scratched to shit in it.
</p>
<p>
	There was a moment of silence, only the sound of people scrambling away and the settling of hot dogs on concrete to fill it.
</p>
<p>
	“HOLY FUCK!” Kayla screamed, throwing the canvas canopy off of herself and popping back up to a seated position. She looked around frantically, throwing the canopy off further away as she did. “Myrtle! Are you ok?! Did your head come off again?”
</p>
<p>
	If any of the people who had been here when they had landed were still around, everything she just said made them get the fuck out of there immediately cause they were dealing with a whole new breed of nutjob here.
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah… yeah it’s… it’s on right, isn’t it…?” Myrtle popped back up, her head slightly askew but still attached by the slightly busted neck brace that was still tightened around her neck.
</p>
<p>
	Kayla placed both hands on the sides of her head and yanked it back forwards with a sickening cracking sound, adjusting the neck brace around to the front again. “Yeah… you’re good. Let’s get the fuck out of here, NOW.”
</p>
<p>
	Both of them stood up, dusted themselves off, and ran at full tilt toward the parking lot to get the fuck out of dodge.
</p>
<p>
	A moment passed before two familiar figures stood at the gaping hole in the wall where the third floor used to be, staring down at the two escaping figures, both dressed again how they originally appeared in disguise somehow. It’s like, moon magic or something, stop asking.
</p>
<p>
	“Should we go after them…?” Mr. Nero said, completely unbothered about all the carnage that just happened.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s unnecessary. We know where they will be going once they make contact.” Mr. Cornwallis said, dabbing at his neck lazily with his handkerchief once more. “It will be a simple matter to kill them then. Vexing though.”
</p>
<p>
	“Vexing indeed.” Mr. Nero stated plainly.
</p>
<p>
	“OH GOD NNNOOOOOOO!!” Dr. Wiener had crawled from the bush he’d been thrown to and dropped to his knees in front of his crushed, destroyed cart of tepid wieners and rapidly cooling batter. He bashed his fists against the ground repeatedly, throwing his head back in anguish. “My cart…! How will I feed my wife and children?! How will we LIVE?! Oh god, I’m ruined…! My legacyyyyyyy!!”
</p>
<p>
	—-------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	Kayla was driving well above the speed limit across the bridge out of Huntington, her knuckles white as she gripped the steering wheel of old beat-up 1968 BMW 2002, the old jalopy barely holding together at the velocity they were traveling.
</p>
<p>
	“We… uh… we gonna talk about what the fuck happened back there, or…?” Myrtle said cautiously, trying not to wince at all of the cuts on her legs she was just gonna have to live with now, she guessed. Nothing ever seemed to heal on her anymore, after all.
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t know! I know just as much as you do about all that shit.” Kayla said with exhasperation in her voice. “I mean… well… maybe not as much in some ways and more in others… You don’t know those two? You were in this cult for a while.”
</p>
<p>
	“Not every cult member knows each other, Kayla! That’s like racist or something!” Kayla launched a virulently glare at Myrtle. “Or no… like… at least cultist. Wait. No. That’s not right. It’s uh…” she trailed off.
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t even know where the hell I’m going right now, Myrtle. Give me some time to think here. My office is destroyed… if they know where my office is they definitely know where my house is. So we can’t go there…” She groaned in frustration, shaking her head. “We need a way out of–
</p>
<p>
	Rrrriiiiiing. Rrrrriiiiinngg.
</p>
<p>
	Kayla’s phone began to ring and vibrate on the dashboard. She side-eyed it for a moment and then looked over to Myrtle, who nodded silently. She picked it up, hit accept call, and held it to her ear.
</p>
<p>
	“Professor Hunter’s office, what can I do you for, sexy?” Myrtle said casually. Kayla grimaced, hoping beyond hope that the practiced, polished way she said that didn’t mean she’d been answering the office phone like that this entire time.
</p>
<p>
	“Ok, look buddy! How many times do I have to tell you? You can see Professor Hunter when you get an appointment!” Myrtle yelled out, old frustration bubbling to the surface. “I don’t give a damn who you are or what organization you’re with! Hey! Hey! Stop trying to talk over me, Mr. Cold, that’s rude dude behavior! We talked about this!”
</p>
<p>
	“Cold? Give me that, damnit!” Kayla snatched the phone away from Myrtle and shoved it into the console, hitting the speakerphone button. That’s driver safety, folks. “Hello?”
</p>
<p>
	“Ms. Hunter, it’s good to hear from you again.” The familiar voice, underline with a strange static that buzzed in her ears and caused her to feel a little woozy - it was all unmistakable.
</p>
<p>
	“Indrid Cold.” Kayla muttered.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m pleased you remember me. I’m afraid I’m calling on business this time, however. You see, I would like to enlist your services for a small job in Connecticut. Whitesville, to be precise.” Cold spoke clearly, though the static beneath his voice always seemed just this close to becoming overwhelming.
</p>
<p>
	“Well…” Kayla looked over at Myrtle, then glanced at herself in the rearview mirror covered in scratches and bruises. “You’re in luck, I guess. I’m currently looking for some new opportunities and a change of locale.”
</p>
<p>
	“Splendid. “ Cold said with an audible smile. “Perhaps we can–”
</p>
<p>
	“Tell her I said hi!” Another unmistakable voice cut in on the line, the static disappearing entirely when he spoke - probably disgusted away from him like everyone else. “Tell her she owes me five bucks from last time! She might fall for that.” Pavlov Flinch yelled from the background of the call.

	“Please, Mr. Flinch… it’s rude to interrupt someone when they are speaking on the phone.” Cold tutted, the static returning when he spoke. “My organization will arrange room and board for you at an Inn just outside of Whitesville - a small skiing town called LaFayette. We will send you all of the pertinent information.”

<p>
	“Fine. We’re on our way.” Kayla said, looking over at Myrtle, who was on her phone scrolling TikTok blandly, with a bored look on her face. When she noticed Kayla was looking at her finally, she did that shrug - head shake combo like “What?” then went back to scrolling. “I’m… sure we’ll be of help.”
</p>
<p>
	“We?” Cold said inquisitively. But dismissed it before Kayla could respond, “Well, nevermind. I’m sure you bring only the most trustworthy into your confidence considering such things. We will see you soon.”

<p>
	Click. The line went dead.
</p>
<p>
	And suddenly the car ride was a lot more silent - partially with the knowledge that they were headed towards something much larger than either could fathom - and partially because they both suddenly realized they’re going to have to drive for several days together and have packed absolutely nothing.
</p>
<p>
	“Fucking shit…” Kayla muttered to herself.
</p>
<p>
	The End
