Don’t Come In

Prompts: Silver & Dinosaurs

By Jeff Pennington

It was nearing the end of March and the chill biting wind of winter was slowly giving way to the swelling warmth of spring, but in that bad way that makes you sweat and then get chills right after and every day just feels like shit to exist in. The kind of gray blah that swaddled you with a malaise that only booze could alleviate. But only if you’re an alcoholic so if you agree with that statement maybe take a long look in the mirror and evaluate things a little bit, right RICH?

Melanie Hall had been spending a lot of time sitting on the front porch in this gray malaise lately, and was at least thankful that she didn’t have to wear her big poofy ass parka jacket anymore. All she needed to keep herself warm was a long smooth drag off a delicious cigarette. Remember the long hard look Rich was supposed to give himself if he agreed with that previous sentence? Ditto for Josh for this one. You’re past this.

You see, Melanie had moved into this rental house about a year ago with her new husband Alex and their best friends, Trent and Beth, but things hadn’t really turned out the way she had hoped they would. It wasn’t so much the fact that Trent had revealed himself to be perhaps one of the most self-centered spoiled rich cocks to ever grace the face of the Earth since the move, continually asking them if they knew what his father did for a living whenever he was asked to do even the slightest chore.

For the record, it’s apparently something to do with business management or corporate synergy, maybe powerbrokering or something, but no one can be bothered to remember. Could he have said corporate slut? That doesn’t sound like a real position. At least not a job position. Well not a job like… look, you get the idea.

Nor was it that Beth wouldn’t stop stealing her food out of the fridge and claiming that was so ‘Virgo’ of her to do, so it was ok. No matter how many times Melanie had asked her not to steal from her and blame it on balls of gas in space it didn’t seem to daunt her. Nor did it dissuade her from continually saying “That’s SO Gemini of you!” whenever she was caught trying to take money out of Melanie’s purse. Apparently if you were born between May 21st and June 21st then you’re NOT a big fan of being robbed blind by your own best friend, because otherwise she’d be WAY cooler about it. The stars could tell you a lot, apparently.

No, it was probably the fact that her husband Alex had locked himself in the basement about a week ago and hadn’t come out since. She had tried to put that in any context in her mind that she could manage in order to make it sound like a normal problem all new couples have but denial only goes so far.

He’d been down there mostly silently for 6 days now, but every so often a loud popping sound or some kind of weird loud sloshing sound would happen and startle her out of her sleep in the middle of the night and she’d go again and try to check on him. Try to get him to come back out. But he never said anything to her, save the same phrase over and over again.

“Don’t come in…! Don’t come in!”

She stood up from the swing on the front porch and pressed the burning end of her cigarette to the banister to snuff it out. With a flick of her wrist she tossed it into the front yard and turned and shuffled back inside. She pulled the door closed behind her and rubbed at the bridge of her nose under her glasses for a moment.

Could it just be like a masturbation thing? Is THAT the best case scenario at this point? Had her life really gotten to such a low point? Was her mother RIGHT about him? She did say he looked like the kinda guy who would constantly slap his tackle and five knuckle shuffle his troubles away.

But she was startled out of her reverie by a sudden muffled knocking at the door just behind her. She jumped and turned quickly but was stopped in her tracks by the sudden realization that she had only been standing there for less than ten seconds.

How could someone have come up and knocked without her even noticing so fast? She pressed her ear to the door and listened intently to the other side. Adjusting to the difference through the door she could hear slow, rhythmically deep breathing on the other side, ragged at its edges like a matinee movie monster waiting for the kill.

She looked at the clock on the wall. It was only 4:30. The sun was still pouring through all the windows in the house. There wasn’t gonna be a Boogeyman knocking on the door in the middle of the damn day. What in the hell was she afraid of?

“Oh… uh yeah… regular killers and rapists and shit…” she whispered under her breath, reaching over into the umbrella stand and yanking out a gigantic black and white striped umbrella and holding it up like a baseball bat.

With one hand still holding onto the umbrella she grasped the door handle, turned it slowly, and then yanked it open full force into the house to reveal…

A dumpy middle aged man dressed head to toe in a red and yellow Dougie the Dinosaur mascot costume, holding a pizza box aloft in one hand. His sunken half-lidded eyes peered up at the umbrella and then back down her face.

“Oh…! Oh my god, I’m sorry.. ! I thought you might be like a… well anyway, hello.” Melanie stumbled over her words a little, setting the umbrella down against the door.

“Uh.. hi I’m uh… here because–” the small dumpy man began, using his non-pizza wielding hand to brush a few strays of thin brown hair off of his forehead and under the foam of the costume.

“OH! The pizza!” Melanie said, pointing at the box and chuckling. But then she stopped in her tracks and rubbed at her neck for a second, feeling a little embarrassment come over her. “Uh, we didn’t order any pizza. I’m the only one home right now besides my husband and I know HE didn’t, so…”

“Uh yeah, I know you didn’t order a pizza.” The short man said with a derisive snort, holding the pizza box toward Melanie and pointing at it with one wooly felt finger. “This is built into the suit, there’s nothing in it. It’s just for show, everyone knows that.”

“Oh.” Melanie said in return.

There was a full fifteen seconds of absolute silence between them then. The man in the Dougie the Dinosaur costume stood staring blankly with his dead half-lidded eyes and Melanie tried her best to keep her eye contact as far away from him as possible while she waited for him to explain himself.

When he didn’t, she continued, a little angrier, “Oooookaaayy, so what the hell are you doing here, then?”

“I’m the private detective you called this morning. Pavlov Flinch? My ad was on the back of the Golden Temple Chinese Restaurant menu. Next to the coupon for Magic Monty’s Love Hotel?” The man tried to reach his hand to his side to retrieve his identification, which was twofold an unbelievably stupid thing to do. One, because he was wearing a mascot costume over his normal clothes and two, because he used the hand holding the gigantic sewn-on pizza box prop, which poked its edge directly into his eye, causing him to stumble backward FAR too animatedly. “GAH!”

“Oh god…” Melanie held a hand over her mouth in disbelief, eyes wide at the spectacle.

“Don’t worry, I’m fine…” Flinch blinked his red, slightly swelling eye and continued, “I just finished a shift as a sign spinner at the Prehistoric Pizza on 3rd. I didn’t have time to ditch the uniform in my neighbor’s drained pool like I usually do before our appointment so I thought I’d just wear it and change here.” he paused for a moment, pointing past her with the pizza prop stuck to his hand, “Can I use your bathroom?”

Melanie looked inside her house and the terror she felt in every molecule of her body at the thought of this middle aged sign spinner dinosaur slumping inside and stinking the place up was almost too much to handle. She looked back at him with barely disguised fear painting her features. “Uhm…”

“Hey look, I understand.” Flinch said, nodding the bulbous mascot head that sat atop his own head. “You don’t have to hire me on if you don’t want to. You do have to pay me my consulting rate for showing up though which is suspiciously similar to my normal pay rate for doing the entire job. But not -legally- suspicious.”

Melanie deflated. She guessed she did need the help. “Fine. Come in.”

Flinch pushed past her, almost crushing her body in the doorway with his big fuzzy felt ass. Somehow he found the bathroom extremely quickly? Like he went straight to it as if he had some kinda sixth sense about where you dumped your shit and piss. That didn’t instill any extra confidence in Melanie.

After about ten minutes of banging and clanging, Flinch stepped out wearing an oversized and wrinkled tan trench coat over a yellow dress shirt, brown slacks and shoes, and his second favorite tie which was shaped like a big brown trout hanging from his neck. He lost his piano tie in a card game at the old folks home last weekend but planned on getting it back by his unbeatable card prowess or simply by being much stronger than his Great Aunt Lucinda.

“Mr. Flinch, I’m in an awful mess.” Melanie began, hoping things would be more normal now that the gigantic red pizza dinosaur costume was mostly out of sight in her guest bathroom’s shower, “My husband kind’ve fell in with the wrong crowd recently, and has changed drastically.”

“Like to being gay?” Flinch asked unironically, “Because that’s not like a bad crowd thing, you’re pretty much born that way.”

“What?” Melanie stopped in her tracks for a moment, but then continued, “Uh.. no, he met these guys at work – he’s a marketing guy at Fleecem Law Offices and these guys were a bunch of paralegals working with them.”

“Booooorrriiiiiinnnggg.” Flinch said, shoving his hands into his coat pockets.

Melanie stared at him blankly for a moment and then timidly continued on, “Ok… Well, they started coming over every night and hanging out in the basement. I wasn’t allowed to go down there to begin with because it was a ‘Boy’s Night’ or something. But as time went on they really changed him. He started talking about Joe Rogen like a LOT and I don’t even know who the fuck that is. He started telling me I need to be more “wifely” and need to “stick to my gender roles”, gettin’ real internet incel at me - and if he wasn’t involuntarily celebate before he started spouting all this horse shit at me, I definitely made sure he was now.”

“Involuntarily celebate, right.” Flinch said in that way that reeked of someone acting like they understood what a phrase means but who had absolutely no clue about it.

“That’s not really my point, Mr. Flinch. His buddies all stayed over one night last week, like some kind of weird slumber party, and the next morning they all left without a word. I mean they walked out not even looking at each other, it really weirded me out. But what was even weirder was that Alex didn’t come up with them. He just stayed down there all day, alone.”

“And it’s… not normal to spend all day alone in a basement?” Flinch searched her face for a reaction and then quickly nodded over and over, “Yes. yes of course. We all know this. We’re both normal.”

“He’s been down there for six days since,” Melanie continued unabated, “There’s no food down there and only an old washing sink for water. Every time I come to the door to try to get him to come up and eat or even just see me, the door is locked and deadbolted and he keeps yelling at me not to come in. That’s all he’s said to me for six days.”

“Uh-huuuhhh…” Flinch said, blank-eyed.

“So… the police said they can’t help me. He can stay in the basement as long as he wants. So I called you for help.”

“Right, right.” Flinch responded vaguely.

“So you can pick the basement lock and check on my husband?”

“Okay…”

“SO I CAN CHECK ON HIM? GET IT?”

“Oh sure, sure of course.” Flinch looked around the room hazily, taking in all the photos on the wall. “You two in like a polygon relationship with these two other folks, or what?”

“....What?!” Melanie yelled, exasperated. She looked at the photos he was glancing at and saw their friends Trent and Beth posing with them smiling. “No, no. …polygon? Do you mean polgyamy?”

“Yeah, yeah I just pronounce it different.” Flinch said with a handwave and turned away from her. “So where’s the basement? We should probably help your husband instead of debating about alternative lifestyles.”

In order to stop herself from going apeshit and choking this man to death she decided to stop trying to communicate with him and show him to the basement door. He seemed to grasp the general basics of what was going on and gave off the air of someone sleazy enough to at least know how to pick a lock and slide a deadbolt.

Standing in front of the door a small voice in the distance immediately spoke up before either of them had even touched it. “Don’t come in…!”

Flinch looked back at Melanie who nodded toward the door. Flinch made a jerk-off motion at her and she buried her face in her hands and then raised her head back up to shake it no vigorously. Flinch shrugged.

“Alright then… let me get my lockpick kit…” he rummaged around inside of his overcoat for a moment. After a couple seconds he began to just unload straight up garbage from inside onto the floor with uncaring tosses. Most of it seemed to be fruit by the foot wrappers? Like a LOT of them. “Oh here it is.”

He pulled out a dinged up old orange screwdriver from his jacket like Tommy Pickles pulling that shit out of his diaper and Melanie gasped in aggravation before she could even think of another reaction. For his part Flinch didn’t even notice, going to work immediately on unscrewing the hinges on the door.

Suddenly Melanie took a step back and stood there flabbergasted for a moment. That was actually pretty brilliant? Who needs a lockpicking kit when you can just remove the door altogether? The 5-Minute Hacks of it was clouding her judgment and she never thought about any other kind of door except an indoor hour one where this wouldn’t work whatsoever.

After much, much longer than either of them would have liked it to take, Flinch had removed the hinge connection on one side of the door and wrenched it open the wrong way, leaving it hanging from the lock and deadbolt on the other side. He huffed and puffed in hard heaving breaths as he sat down against the wall and stuffed his old screwdriver back in his coat.

“Gimme a second or I’m… I’m gonna heave.” Flinch puffed out, placing his hand on his chest and resting his head back against the wall.

Melanie peered into the darkness of the basement and then decided to head back and grab the umbrella from near the front door. Unfortunately for her, the door swung open and Trent and Beth sashayed inside, both of them more than a little tipsy for a little after 5pm.

“Oh, thanks for meeting us at the door to take our coats, Melanie! I’m glad you stopped fighting us on giving a little extra service! It’s you poor’s job in life after all.” Trent blathered, swinging his 500 dollar fleece jacket at Melanie’s face. She, of course, let it drop to the ground.

“Melanie, I know you’re feeling very put-upon and grounded to the Earth, because Venus is in retrograde, but don’t worry! You’ll find your soul mate soon according to your sixth house’s spiral moon phase! That’s so Gemini.” Beth rambled with all the conviction only the most powerful crystals can grant you.

“I… I don’t need to find a soul mate, Beth, I’m married. I can’t really deal with you guys right now, I’m really busy.” She snatched up the umbrella again and marched back down the hall toward the basement door.

Trent and Beth looked at either other, each one looking more offended than the last. Beth chided, “Her moon is in Aries, she’s just being angry because the stars willed it.”

“She should pray to the stars to will her some cash. Humhumhumhum.” Trent laughed, holding the back of his hand up in front of his mouth, haughtily.

Flinch was stumbling back up to his feet when Melanie arrived back and pointed through the door between them. “Go on ahead.” she said with a lot more conviction in her voice.

“Me? I’m not gettin’ axe murdered for 12 bucks an hour plus expenses, lady. He’s your masturbator husband, not mine.” Flinch stepped back away from the door, shoving his hands back in his pockets.

“This is the worst day of my life…” Melanie grumbled under her breath, turning and taking her first step into the darkness. The familiar squeak of the top step was somewhat reassuring but did send a jolt of fear up her spine all the same. Then it was a matter of a step at a time, down into the darkness.

For his part, Flinch did follow along. Partially out of a morbid curiosity that drove his every move and partially out of the ultimate desire to actually get paid in full for once.

The two of them descended the old wooden stairs down into the pitch blackness of the basement, both wishing they had thought to bring a flashlight down. But Melanie did stop on the bottom step, peering as hard as she could into the darkness with incredulity. (in cred juul ity)

“Wait… there are two windows to the outside down here… there’s no way it should be this dark…” she whispered back to Flinch. She fumbled around in the darkness, grasping at nothingness to reach the dangling light switch chain.

The lights turned on, but were still pretty dim all things considered. All things in this case would have sent even the most cast iron of stomachs into a spiral. On every wall, all across the couch, spread over the old television in the corner, blotting out the windows and spreading over the ceilings and light figures - even dug into the concrete block walls of the basement, was dripping sickeningly raw undulating meat - moving with the rhythm of a snake digesting in every direction.

Melanie screamed a piercing shriek and Flinch turned to run up the stairs and leave this bitch on her own with all this shit - like usual - but he tripped on the first one and fell face-first into the wooden steps, sliding back down.

“Don’t… don’t come… in…” a small voice pleaded from far beyond the room. Melanie composed herself enough to follow the sound of her husband’s voice. Amidst the disgusting graying meat that twisted and turned against the concrete wall at the far side of the room was a hole that the pulsing tentacles of meat seemed to have bore into the stone and earth itself beyond it, only pitch black inside beyond the crevice. The voice floated out of the hole like it was a hundred feet away, being screamed at this point as it repeated, “Don’t… come… in…”

“A-Alex…?!” Melanie screamed toward the hole, her voice being swallowed up inside of its deep dark inky blackness.

“Your husbands a hole?!” Flinch stammered, pushing himself back up to his feet and frantically searching inside of his overcoat for his gun. Inside of the shoulder holster strapped around his chest was a purple Gameboy Advance, still turned on, playing Donkey Kong Country. He shifted his eyes back to Melanie and then quietly saved his game, turned it off and slipped it back into his holster.

“Alex!!” she screamed again, wind rushing out of the blackened orifice of writhing flesh and muscle that coated the walls sending her hair whipping around her face.

“I… tried to… tell you…” the voice within the darkness began to distort and twist on the wind, an extremely elongated bloody arm piercing out of the darkness and grasping onto the wall next to the hole - a wave of blood spurting out of the darkness and sluicing across the murky fleshy floor.

Both Melanie and Flinch recoiled back away, eyes wide and the wind buffeting them.

“DON’T COME IN!!” the inhuman distortion of multiple voices wailed out of the dark, the wall splitting open like a violent wound and pouring forth a deluge of blood into the room. The arm pressed into the wall and pushed its body out as well, an elongated, melting bloody skeletal form with blazing white eyes every couple inches all over it. The infernal screech that erupted from its constantly shifting form filled the room to the brink before its massive body did the same.

From its back, as if erupting from inside of its body like painful foreign growths, two gigantic organs exploded into the open air, bones jutting out of them like needles pinned through. They were grotesque beyond imagining but without a doubt the creature had grown what could only be called wings, regardless of their make - and six of them.

Melanie turned and pushed past Flinch up the stairs, the private detective frozen in abject horror at the just the sight of this eldritch creature. But it only took him a second before he was running up after her as well, escaping the nightmarish vision.

The creature placed its gnarled, seeping hands together and bowed its elongated mishapen tumorous head, seething and gurgling blood from its jagged lipless maw. After a moment of blasphemous prayer it reared its head back and a burning, spinning, jagged mass of flames erupted from the top of its head in a perfect, blinding circle.

Melanie ran for the front door and wrenched it open, charging outside onto the front lawn as fast as she could. Trent and Beth were sitting in the living room and watched her run out, exchanging judgemental glances and then turning their eyes back to the newest season of The Bachelor undisturbed.

Pavlov Flinch wasn’t far behind, literally diving out the front door and off the front porch into the grass and skidding across it to just shy of Melanie. She scrambled up to his feet and began to fumbling around his jacket for his Motorola Flip Phone to call for help but Melanie already had her new sensible normal person phone out, dialing it frantically.

Trent and Beth scoffed at all of the ruckus and Trent stood up, walking out to the foyer to follow them and give them a piece of his mind. Don’t they know what his dad does for a living?!

He didn’t get a chance though. The wall to the basement was ripped away and down into the darkness like tissue paper, long thin, blood-soaked fingers scraping at the floor like a hand on a doll house, ripping away the floorboards that stood between it and ascending to the first floor. Trent wobbled and fell from the shaking of the entire house, barely having enough time to scream at the nightmarish visage that greeted him.

The massive thing grabbed Trent by his head with one hand and his legs with the other and pulled, sending his body flying in two directions and slapping coldly into motionless in both.

It continued to ascend to the first floor, tearing the house down with its movement. The entire front facia collapsed inward as the creature drug itself up to the front yard, pulling earth and sidewalk in on itself as it did but never slowing down.

Melanie screamed another blood-curdling scream and for his part, so did Flinch, running all the way across the street and diving behind an old Dodge for safety.

The thing grasped Melanie by her waist and lifted her into the air, the blood gushing from unseen wounds in its hands nearly overtaking her, but her head and shoulders managing to stay above the deluge. She screamed at the top of her lungs and the gigantic horror threw its head back and screamed into the newly minted night at the top of its own.

When it turned its hollow, blindingly glowing gaze back to her, the inhuman cacophony of voices hissed out a whisper from the boundless abyss within it’s lipless mouth, “You were supposed… to wait… I was to be reborn first… then you would enter the cocoon… we would have been… ascendants… the heralds of the Umbralborn…”

Brrrrriinnngg. Brrrrriiiinnnggg.

Flinch reached into his breast pocket and returned with his Motorola, which was jangling with every ring. He looked wide-eyed at the “Caller Unknown” on the tiny preview screen and then glanced back at the hulking abomination taking up the entire lot across the street, shrugged, and flipped the phone open, placing it to his ear.

“Hello, Mr. Flinch. I believe you should lay down on the ground and cover your ears now.”

-click-

The line went dead and Flinch held the phone out away from himself, staring at the ‘call ended’ screen for a long moment. He glanced back at the horror unfolding across the street and immediately face-planted into the ground, shoving his hands over his ears.

All sound - whether the constant gushing bleeding of the massive corpse, the screaming of Melanie Hall, the crashing of wood and steel, or the peeing of a detective’s pants even if such a thing could possibly be happening, was suddenly gone. Everything was deafened and silent. Melanie’s eyes glazed over and she stopped screaming altogether, hanging limp from the bloody thing’s gnarled fingers. The eldritch horror’s screeching was gone and it hung limp for a moment against the massive hole it had created with its thrashing movements coming up from the basement.

Flinch hadn’t noticed the black van parked just down the street when he had arrived but vaguely remembered there being a car there. Nevertheless the side doors opened and three individuals exited onto the street and toward the scene. A tall thin man in black wearing red sunglasses. A short man in a bolo tie and bolero hat stuffing a burger into his mouth. An enormous hairy man lumbering along with extremely long arms. The three of them moved without much sense of urgency, stopping in the middle of the street.

The thin man in sunglasses set a small piece of absolutely perfectly smooth silver metal on the ground in the middle of the street and took a step back from it. That was the last thing that Flinch remembered seeing.

—------------------------------------

When he opened his eyes again he was slumped onto a wooden bench, his arm thrown over the back of it casually to prop him up as he had napped. He couldn’t remember how he’d gotten there, but looking around him the street was extremely familiar. It was the exact same street he had been on before - where he had dove behind a Dodge for safety. Where those weirdos in black had shown up. Where…

Flinch jumped up to his feet and looked around frantically, his hands doing another fumbling dance around his coat to find that pistol he had forgotten he’d switched out for a game of Donkey Kong Country before. But he was stopped in his tracks by the sound of children laughing and yelling.

He finally adjusted his eyes and saw what should have been plainly obvious from the beginning. Where the house he had come to investigate a basement masturbator had once stood, now stood a small playground, with benches, a slide, a jungle gym, monkey bars, and even a small fountain in the middle. He sat down back, flabbergasted. For the first time in a long time, without a stupid one-liner.

He barely registered the man who sat down beside him near-silently on the bench, until he spoke in an overly-chipper voice. “We work pretty quickly to cover these kinds of things up.”

“What?” Flinch blurted out, startled by the sudden appearance. He instantly recognized the man as the tall gentleman who wore the red sunglasses from before - Not because of any detective capabilities but since he was dressed exactly the same.

“It’s easy to explain away noises and explosions as demolition. The old house was just being torn down to make way for this nice neighborhood park. Our crews put this together in a couple days. While you were napping.” the tall thin man said, adjusting the sunglasses on his nose.

“Look no offense or anything but who in the flying fuck are you and… “Flinch paused, a sudden pallor coming over his face. “...a couple days? Napping…?”

“My name is Indrid Cold. I work for an organization of… concerned citizens. The Silverblood Society. We wish to help people.” He paused for a moment to lean back on the bench, casually placing his arm over the back of it. “We took care of you while you were unconscious. An unfortunate side effect of the machine.”

Flinch sat absolutely dumbfounded, staring at this man with his mouth agape and his eyes wide. Something about this man made every hair on Flinch’s neck stand up and set every nerve on edge in him.

“We wish to offer you a job, Mr. Flinch.” Cold continued unabated, crossing one leg over the other.

“A job…? I… I didn’t even get paid for the one I just did!” Flinch suddenly realized, slapping his own forehead and forgetting the eeriness of the situation almost immediately. “This is the third job this week… Mom’s not gonna be happy I can’t pay off the Skinimax bill again this month.”

“Ah, yes. Miss Hill has been somewhat …predisposed because of her association with our basement-dwelling friend. We will cover the cost of your employment.” Cold reached into his jacket pocket and returned with a rolled up wad of cash, handing it over to Flinch unceremoniously - almost with a disgust for currency in the very act.

“This is…” Flinch unrolled the wad and began to count it out quickly, thought not quickly enough for a man his age by even half, then looked back to Cold with wide eyes. “This is like 700 bucks!”

“And there’s plenty more where that came from if you’re interested in working with us.” Cold said matter-of-factly, again with some disgust for the whole exchange.

“What do I gotta do?” Flinch questioned, “Is this like a sex thing?”

“No… no it’s not.” Cold said plainly.

“Oh…” Flinch responded, “Could it be?”

“No.” Cold stood up from the bench and reached back into his jacket pocket, returning with a small business card and handing it over to Flinch. “You once… lost... this out a bus window. Do try to keep a better hold of it this time.”

Flinch turned over the card in his hand and squinted at the gold-pressed lettering on one side of it.

“Indrid Cold…” he read out loud to himself, looking over the card for any other info. On the other side of it was an address, “1313 Mockingbird Lane, Whitesville, Connecticut. What’s there?”

“The end of the world as we know it.” Indrid Cold said plainly, adjusting the lapels on his peacoat. “And for you? A gainful business opportunity.”

The End
