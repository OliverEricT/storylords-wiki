Sins of the Father

Prompts: Blacksmiths & Axes

By Jeff Pennington


The old RV sputtered along as best it could up the empty street toward its destination - quite possibly it’s final one considering the shape it happened to be in at the moment. 


Jason Grace had gone to a forbidden town to find answers about his missing brother Archie and had come back completely empty-handed. Unfortunately he had met capitalism’s perfect lapdogs the small town police when he tried to come back home to Kirby through the blockade at the edge of town. 


Being the standard deplorable pigdogs that all police are across this great nation the cops at the barricade immediately drew their guns and escalated like no mall ever could - screaming at him in their bloated jowely chorus that he was under arrest for breaking a quarantine he’d never heard about.


Being the level-headed, straight-laced young man that he is, he simply barreled through the blockade at full speed and caused a massive wreck from which he barely escaped mostly unscathed but his degenerate hired Private Eye was still missing. Not that he really cared much since that dude was more worthless than a rubber in your mom’s nasty cave of horrors (they melt inside). He couldn’t even remember his name. Einstein Filch? That sounded right.


He turned the busted up old RV into a driveway next to a two-story family home that he’d been running from since he graduated a few years ago, never less happy than now to be returning. He pulled all the way to the end of it, underneath an old metal awning he had put together himself to keep his RV out of the rain and shut off the sputtering engine.


“Fuck me…” he huffed out under his breath, leaning back into the old beaded driver’s seat and hanging his wrists over the steering wheel limply. 


The radio played a local station that purported to spin all the hottest rock tracks in history but was currently playing a tinny rendition of a Katy Perry song for some reason, so it was doing nothing to lower his usual skyrocketing blood pressure. He reached down to shut it off but as his fingers reached the dial a scratchy electronic interference squealed through the speakers in the music’s place.


Skkkrrcchhh…sskk cccchhh….


There…. Are…. two…. Moons….


The strange voice caused Jason to narrow his eyes as he stared down at the flickering light of the FM dial on his dashboard. But just as quickly as the music had cut out due to static, the next few beats of static crescendoed right back into Katy Perry warbling about being yourself or whatever. He clicked his teeth and shut the radio off, chalking that up to another in a long line of fucked up weird shit he’d seen lately. 


He quickly yanked the door handle down and placed his boot against the inside panel of the door, shoving it open with a heavy push. The bent metal of the door hinge whining loudly as it pushed back against his force. He pushed harder once and a loud metallic popping ushered the door to fly out and allow his exit. He huffed in annoyance as he dropped to the concrete driveway beneath.


The house looked exactly the same as he’d left it when he’d gone back to school for his last semester at college. The deep golden light of the setting sun cast long, warm shadows across the well-manicured grass which swayed in the light breeze calmly. The light shone on each blade and cast small dancing shadows across the ground which emphasized the calm in the peaceful oncoming night’s air which sought to supplant it.


His old motorcycle was still there, under the awning and covered in an old blue tarp which had been folded so many times as to look like crumpled old reynolds wrap at this point. He couldn’t even muster a smile for the idea of hopping back on it for a ride later. 


No… he had something to do now, whether he liked it or not.


Out behind the Grace family house was a landmark famous in the Uppervale neighborhood of the little town of Kirby - mostly famous because the HOA had been trying for twenty straight years to force them to remove it with every single legal trick they could possibly come up with - a blacksmith’s forge inside of a soot-covered metal shack in the back corner of the lawn. Jason’s dad’s forge. Bane of every Karen in a ten block radius.


Even now, smoke rolled out of the top of it like a character from Daranos ripping giant fucking bong clouds of the hottest orc kush this side of Graal’s seediest, sleaziest, nuttingest neighborhood, infamously frequented by Dogmen of every breed, The Red Rocket District. A tell-tale sign that Mr. Grace was hard at work within. 


“Dad?” Jason called, standing outside the shack and tapping the toe of his boot against the heavy metal door of the one-room forge. “You in there or did you leave it on to burn our fucking house down again?”


“WHAT?” The door swung open widely, revealing the soot-covered man in tinted goggles from within. He was a tall, broad man who had definitely been in shape in his younger days, but absolutely didn’t give a shit about his appearance right now cause he was wearing a pair of striped boxer shorts, a white tank top, combat boots, and a heavy leather iron-workers apron and was sweating from every pore more than your mama’s nasty ferret hole does whenever a Y chromosome gets within 500 feet of her. Not to mention the heavy five o’clock shadow and huge bushy mustache he wore to compliment his salt and pepper flyaway hair going in every direction.


“Take off the fucking goggles, it’s me. Your son!” Jason yelled out, cupping his hands to either side of his mouth.


“ARCHIE?!” Mr. Grace called out, yanking his goggles over his head and blinking his eyes heavily in the blinding golden sunset light. “Oh…it’s just you, Jason. What the hell do YOU want?”


“Oh, fucking lovely, dad. Love to hear that kinda greeting from my own fuckin’ father.” Jason sad exasperatedly, throwing his hands up in the air.


“Look son, I dunno what to tell ya, you’re a real disappointment. Do better at bein’ a son, it’s not that hard.” Mr. Grace said off-handedly, running his sooty hands through his brown and gray hair and doing a surprisingly good job of making himself look more presentable. He was a lawyer by day, after all. 


Jason tried to control his boiling rage. “Look, fucknut. I went to Whitesville to follow up about Archie’s disappearance.”


“I TOLD you not to do that, you little peckerwood! The police are investigating the problem and you’re just gonna fuck it up with your shitty no-baseball playing bullshit, just like you fucked up high school for me.” Mr. Grace said without a hint of irony in his voice.


“It was MY high school years you sad old fuck!” Jaso yelled out. “Just because your dick doesn’t work anymore doesn’t mean you get to live vicariously through me! By the way, I’m SURE I must’ve gotten my big swangin’ dick from Grandpa cause I KNOW you’re packing a vienna sausage in those children’s size small Underoo-ass boxers.” 


“I told you not to go looking for Archie, and I fuckin’ meant it, you little fartknocker.” Mr. Grace said, again not paying any attention to what Jason had just said. “I mean, look at how you fucked it up THIS time! You’re out there recovering zero missing brothers and I’m pumping new little brothers into your mom to make up for your failure the whole time!”


“There isn’t enough therapy in the fucking WORLD to come back from hearing that shit.” Jason said disgustedly, then threw his hands in the air once more. “Y’know what? Fuck you, man. Gimme the keys to the fucking bike, I’m taking off again. If you won’t get your thumb out of your ass long enough to find your own missing son then I’ll do it for you! Just like how Mr. Parish nextdoor has been fucking mom for you for the last fifteen years!”


“God fucking damnit, Jason! You dumb little bastard, you’re not listening to a word I’m fucking saying! Do NOT go after your little brother, you’re gonna fuck everything up!” Mr. Grace screamed a little louder and more seriously this time.


Jason took a step forward and pointed his finger directly in his father’s face, finger right up under his nose and gritted his teeth as he spoke, “I’m gonna find Archie and you’re gonna have a prime piece of real estate to kiss right on my pimply ass cheek, you yuppy ass fuckboy! You just go back to practicing to be on Forged in Fire so you can tell the buff Marine Corp. host dude how much you respect him and his service instead of what you REALLY wanna tell him about your foxhole fantasies about becoming P.O.W.’s who get forced into a donkey show together!”


“Have you been reading my journal, you disgusting little missed money shot?!” his dad screamed back at him.


There was a terse moment of silence and then Mr. Grace turned and stormed back into his metal blacksmithing shed, disappearing into the darkness within, only the forge dimly illuminating anything beyond the threshold as it silently smoldered.


Jason was about to turn to leave in the pissy huff I would surely never leave in because I’m a big strong boy with no daddy issues at all when Mr. Grace emerged from the darkness of the shed once more - this time carrying a fireman’s axe laid across his hands that’s blade glinted extremely brightly in the sunset. 


“Here you little fucking ingrate.” Mr. Grace held the axe out towards Jason in a gesture of offering, swinging the it by the dark hickory haft around once and then laying it across his hands again for his son to take from him.


“Uh.. you’re giving me a wood chopping axe? I live in the fucking city, you dementia riddled old lead-poisoning victim.” Jason said as blunt as ever.


“It’s a fucking peace offering, you dim little bitch! Take it and get the fuck outta my sight!” Mr. Grace spat out, shoving the axe into Jason’s hands forcefully, reaching into his apron and returned with the keys to the motorcycle and shoved them over just the same, and then turned away to stomp back into his little forge shed and slamming the door behind him.


The metallic ringing of the door slamming reverberated off the surrounding houses as Jason stood there dumbfounded holding the axe across both hands. He thought for a moment about what he had seen in Whitesville. The things that had happened there. Perhaps it wasn’t such a bad idea to carry a more lethal weapon with him for now.


He walked back to his camper and went in through the still-functioning side door to the living space. Inside he retrieved the duffel bag he’d been using as a backpack at school cause it was ‘less likely to stop the flow of bitches’ according to his friends and he wasn’t averse to a nice flow of bitches, as most folks aren’t. He dumped the contents out, shoved some clothes and toiletries inside and slid the axe in with the handle dangling out like a sheathed sword, and slung it over his shoulder.


With one twist of his wrist the tarp over his bike was gone. It purred to life instantly, feeling to Jason as if it had been awaiting his return this entire time. A beautiful motorcycle that I’m not bothering to look up the brand to because they aren’t sponsoring our podcasts and I’m done giving out fuckin’ free rides to brands. Give us the fucking money and I’ll advertise your racist ass motorcycle brand name next time. It’s a cool motorcycle and he gets on it and rides away, fuck you.


—---------------------------


A week later Kirby had come alive for dweebs and social fuckups of two very specific brands as the Budget Inn Ballroom and Event Space presented the annual SCRIPT KIDS & CRYPTIDS CONVENTION which brought together coders, hackers, cryptozoologists and generally unshowered circus geeks of every caliber from across the greater tri-state area!


The event hall was as jam-packed as you’d expect such an event to be, which is not very, with a gaggle of some of the nicest little nerds you could hope to meet and also Star Wars fans - all of them bustling to hear the commencement speech by the big name hacker and cryptozoologist they had heard had made one of the biggest discoveries in the history of either science.


The crowd hushed as the small man waltzed across stage with an unearned bravado that only someone who spends 99% of their time on the internet could muster. He adjusted his oversized glasses upon his cherubic face and smiled as he leaned into the microphone and spoke.


“Welcome fellow Hackers and Cryptid Enthusiasts! As you ALL probably know by now, I’m cryptozoology legend Devlin Durwood the Third! I’m here to blow your socks right outta your penny loafers and make the smell someone besides your mom’s problem! You’re not gonna BELIEVE this stuff, baby!” Dev cried out with aplomb, causing the whole crowd to launch into sweaty-palmed applause. 


He swiped his hands in either direction sideways, causing the whole crowd to stop cheering at once. Dead silence covered the crowd. He tapped a key on the keyboard on the podium in front of him and the large curtains behind him swung open, revealing a massive screen behind them. It only took a second or two to notice it was a truly humongous 1990’s big screen TV which hummed with enough radiation to kill Superman for good, but no one in the room seemed to be old enough to know about the danger, so it was whatever.


“BEHOLD!” Dev called out, clicking his mouse a couple times. The screen displayed a Windows 95 desktop with several folders labeled things “Budget Inn Taxes 2001” and “Nude Photos Fran Drescher.” The crowd giggled amongst themselves. “Wow they really don’t update this much, huh?”


He clicked around a few more times and his powerpoint presentation appeared in all its 720p glory. The first slide was a full-on shot of the cricket monster that had attacked the office building he’d been in a week ago. The crowd gasped loudly.


“How d’ya like me NOW?” Dev called out, grasping onto the open lapels of his overalls and running his hands up and down them cockily. 


Over the next eight minutes he went through each photo and explained what happened in a previous story you probably already read. If you haven’t, WHADDYA DOIN’? Go check out “Office Job Massacre 2” in Storylords episode number thirty four. Also give us money. OH SHIT I FORGOT TO UPLOAD MORE WRITTEN STORIES! I wrote that just in case I had forgot to do it. Which I most certainly did. I wrote those last two parts to explain and cover my ass. I wrote that part and this one just for fun. 


“So there you have it! Unimpeachable proof of the existence of a shady evil organization plotting to do unspeakable things to the human race utilizing horrific mutant abominations that can destroy with impunity!” Dev called out, waving his hands through the air dramatically. 


A heavyset man wearing a t-shirt which read “Rey’s Gotta Pay - No Women in Star Wars except if they were already in a Star Wars movie that already came out before now” raised his hand in the middle of the hushed crowd.


“Yes? We’ve got a question?” Dev asked, pointing at the man in the crowd.


“Mmmyes, do you think that we’re a bunch of morons?” the man asked plainly.


“Uh… what?” Dev returned.


“You understand that we aren’t spring chickens fresh off the stupid truck, correct? We have all heard of CGI, Photoshop, and AI image manipulation. None of us care about the people who make the things we love, only that a new product is created with our favorite logo on it. Of COURSE we know and love AI image generation, you plebe!” the degenerate piece of filth in the audience responded.


“These are real! I can show you the metadata! You can look at any of them on my website at any time! TheDevroom dot geocities slash realmonsters slash proof slash 03346 dot com!” Dev began to panic a little, feeling the shifting mood in the room against him.


Another hand went up. This time a woman wearing a “Yes Women Watch Star Wars, Yes We Also Hate Rey” t-shirt and holding a small flag with Sephiroth and Cloud kissing shirtless on it. She just immediately spoke without waiting, “Do you think the cricket man would ever want to mate with a human female? I’m asking for a very scientific reason.”


Another hand shot up. A very small adult man wearing a football jersey with some completely unrecognizable ass z-tier sports anime character on it standing next to a woman wearing a string bikini with the largest tits you’ve ever seen. The words “Middle School Football Star” appear above them with a spate of katakana and kanji under it. “I’m a little confused about why you would bring us patently fraudulent evidence. We are a revered society of Cryptozoologists and only believe the most compelling and proven evidence in our fields such as Bat Boy and the government creating clones of pop stars and movie actors for seemingly no reason. You’re bringing us evidence equal to absolutely unbelievable horse shit such as Global Warming or racism.”


“Jesus christ.” Dev said with exasperation in his voice. He threw his arm out quickly and pointed to the back of the room to a man seated away from the crowd. “You there! You look like you believe what I’m saying!”


Jason Grace looked up at being pointed out from the crowd and blinked a few times, looking around the room with glossy eyes. He turned his gaze back to Dev and shrugged a little. “I’m just here because it’s air conditioned, free, and literally no one of importance would ever step foot inside here for literally any fucking reason I could think of.”


“This is not going the way I pictured it…” Dev muttered to himself, the crowd's angry murmur beginning to rise to a full blown angry racket.


But now that he had looked up, Jason blinked at the screen. The last slide showed a full head-on photo of the cricket creature leaping through the air over top of Dev’s camera position as he hunkered. Recognition blazed across Jason’s face all at once - even having seen this creature from a block away while driving there was no mistaking the hulking, bladed inhuman that he’d seen a week ago.


He stood up and tilted his head, calling over the din of the crowd in his booming angry ginger voice, “YO WAIT JUST ONE FUCKING SECOND!”


The crowd hushed, their fight or flight instinct kicking in from years of bullying, and all turned to face Jason. Dev did the same from the stage, his anxiety switching targets entirely.


“Where the FUCK did you get these photos, little dorky guy?” Jason stepped out of his seat and headed down the aisle toward the front of the auditorium with heavy purposeful footfalls. 


“Weren’t you.. Paying attention?” Dev asked with an awkward placating smile. He pointed up at the screen as he scrolled back through the slides. “I was at Harbury Industrial Park outside of town. We had to go through two police blockades to get there.”


“I’ve seen that thing before!” Jason had climbed up onto the stage by now, causing the entire crowd to explode into an uproar over the breach of social etiquette which they cared more about than defrauding a charity for 600 thousand dollars ANY day.


“Y…you have?” Dev perked up, excitement returning to him with someone there to back up his claims to this crowd of emotionally stunted ingrates.


“Yeah, that thing saved my life in Whitesville last week!” Jason returned, causing the crowd to gasp once more, since everyone here understood how difficult it had been to get to Kirby without breaking any of the police roadblocks. Not because they thought it was against the law or they cared about that, they were a bunch of adult children so they were just angry someone got to do something they weren’t allowed to. “He was like this mysterious asian dude in a trench coat one minute, went into a house with a monster, then was a monster himself the next minute. It was fucking WILD, man.”


“Wait… aren’t you the nutjob who attacked our car in Whitesville a week ago…?” Dev murmured out, instantly regretting the question.


“You’re the weird little nerd who was with the bootlicker! Why the fuck did you run away from me?!” Jason growled out, stepping towards Dev.


The lights in the event hall began to flicker on and off, a strange singing static in the air making the hair on Jason’s arm stick straight up. He flung around all at once to look up at the lights in confusion.


Dev stared out at the crowd, narrowing his eyes to avoid the constant flashing of the bulbs high above them lining the ceiling. The crowd all looked about, stunned into silence by the sudden strobing lights, their mouths agape and their bodies tensed from the fear coursing through them.


The lights flashed once, the crowd stared in bewilderment up at Jason and Dev standing on the stage. The lights flashed again, and every single one of them was gone. In their place a small man sat in the very center of the auditorium with his hands folded over the head of an old metal cane.


The light burned a blood red all over the room now, not the fluorescent white that had been burning their retina before, awash over the old man in his seat like blood. He smiled a crooked smile, sitting there staring up at them silently. He wore a heavy woolen winter coat over a fancy double-breasted brown suit and pleated pants, with fine Italian shoes. His eyes were bulging and bloodshot, and he was completely bald save for the sides and back of his head where slightly unkempt white bedraggled hair dangled around his ears and the nape of his neck.


“Who the FUCK is THIS now?!” Jason screamed out, pointing at the old man in the crowd.


The lights flashed once more, and returned to white, the entire crowd still sitting there staring up at them in fear, almost catatonic with it as no sound escaped any of them save for a slight whimper here and there as they struggled to even blink, let alone move.


The lights flashed off, then red once more, revealing the old man standing in front of the chair he had been seated in once before. His bulging bloodshot eyes rolled unnaturally from one of them to the other, his crooked, elongated smile twitching as they did. 


“Kk…kk-kk…” the old man managed to mouth out, his teeth scraping against each other as he did. 


Dev backed away from the front of the stage a few steps, and Jason took a few steps forward, throwing his duffel bag off of his shoulder and yanking his new fireman’s axe out of it with a violent pull. He tossed the duffel bag to the floor next to him and grasped the dark wooden haft with both hands, gritting his teeth to push down the fear welling up in him.


The lights flashed off, then back on again rapidly, the crowd screaming their lungs out in unison, a deafening, violent scream which filled the walls to bursting and caused both Jason and Dev to recoil away from it all at once, but the lights flashed off again before they could process it. 


The red light snapped back on and the old man in the center of the room drew his jaw open so very slowly. His mouth widened, and widened, further and further open, far beyond what a human being could ever managed, his entire jaw unzipping to reveal row after row after row of sharp, predator’s teeth inside of his head as his entire skull unhinged itself backwards to create a massive black hole of a maw. 


From within the unattached jaw poured hundreds upon hundreds, thousands upon thousands, of cockroaches. They poured out like a fountain, flying into the air and skittering along the ground in a wave which overtook the chairs of the auditorium in a moving blanket of black. The roachs enveloped the auditorium seats, the walkways, crawled up the walls at the far sides and even began to land on the ceiling - every single one of them darting directly for Jason and Dev like a hungry predator to their defenseless prey.


Dev screamed bloody murder and began to try to run but there was nowhere to run. Jason wanted to scream too but he gripped his axe tighter and braced himself for the onslaught, his eyes wide and his entire body shaking in horrific, unstopping fear.


“FUUCKKK MYYY LIIIIFFEEEEE!!!” Jason screamed as the swarm came upon him.


—--------------------------


Mr. Grace pounded at the craggy old spring steel on his forge, the red hot bead in the middle of it moving with each hammerstrike. Sparks shot up onto the goggles which covered very little of his face, the singeing ends not affecting him at all as they died out in his beard.

“You gave him the weapon?” a voice flitted out of the darkness behind Mr. Grace, an uneasiness raising deep within him that by this point had become familiar enough to be second nature.

“Yeah I gave him the fucking axe.” Mr. Grace grumbled.

“You act as if this was a burden.” From behind him slowly appeared as if rising from the shadows like floating from within a body of water the form of a tall man in all black, the finest of black suit and peacoat with a wide black tie and tightly slicked back black hair. Upon his long, hooked nose sat a pair of round sunglasses inset with deep, fiery red lenses. 

“It is a fucking burden!” Mr. Grace snapped. “You’re sendin’ my last son off to die for your stupid fucking purpose! Haven’t you gotten enough out of my bloodline already, Cold?!”

“You joined the Silverbood Society of your own volition, Mr. Grace. No one forced your hand.” Indrid Cold said in a low, even tone, no hint of emotion within his voice.

“You’re forcin’ my hand right now, you spooky old fuck!” Mr. Grace returned.

“You owe a debt.” Cold said without inflection. “You lost the silver cane. You haven’t paid for it yet.”

“That turned out for the fuckin’ best though, didn’t it? She does your work without even being asked since she got it!” Mr. Grace spoke with slightly less bass in his voice then.

“Fortunate mistakes are still mistakes. And could be all the worse for it.” Cold returned.

“He’s my son.” Mr. Grace said with a slight timbre of sadness in his voice.

“That doesn’t really mean anything to me, Mr. Grace. I apologize, but the work is all that matters.”

“Can you at least promise me you’ll watch over him?” Mr. Grace asked with his voice faltering.

But no one was there in the shadows any longer to hear it.
