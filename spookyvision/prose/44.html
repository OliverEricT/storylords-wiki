<p>
	The seemingly endless room full of suited up, grayed out honkeys felt swelteringly hot and yet strangely cold at the same time. TK was having trouble figuring out whether to keep her jacket buttoned or not as she sat uncomfortably in her chair at the center of the long table. For some reason her chair seemed a lot smaller than everyone elses? She couldn’t really figure out why she felt that way, but she definitely did.
</p>
<p>
	Alyssa looked around the room with dangerous, calculating eyes. Something about this didn’t seem right to her - down to her very core it seemed wrong, in fact. But no matter how hard she strained against the fog at the periphery of her thoughts she couldn’t place a finger on what was making her feel this way. Confused, out of place – trapped.
</p>
<p>
	The well-dressed woman at the head of the endless mahogany meeting room desk drummed her fingers against the lacquered wood while she took appraisal of the two of them. TK felt an overwhelming desire to look away from her piercing gaze, but Alyssa met it head on. There was something painfully familiar about this woman to both of them, though neither could lay claim to knowing what that happened to be. But it certainly wasn’t that she was their boss. …was it?
</p>
<p>
	“Well, I must say, the more I look over these reports on your performances the more disappointed I become. You two are two of our youngest project managers, after all. You were brought on at Arklay Bakeries to inject some new blood into our organization …so to speak.” The woman leaned back in her chair and puffed at her cigarette with a smirk at the edge of her lips, the kind of small tick that betrayed an inside joke she wasn’t going to let anyone else in on.
</p>
<p>
	“We…!” TK began a little louder and more forcefully than she had anticipated, then leaned back into her chair, clammed up immediately at her own outburst. She frantically looked over at Alyssa, who shrugged back at her dramatically. The two of them air-squabbled back and forth without making a sound for only a moment before Alyssa held up a hand to stop TK and turned back to the boss lady.
</p>
<p>
	“We’re uh… unsure what it is we could have done that was so unsatisfactory. Could you be a little more direct on what it is that we’ve failed to do here at… uh..” Alyssa glanced up at the sign on the wall, read it as quickly as she could, then looked back at the boss, “Arklay Bakeries.”
</p>
<p>
	“We’re trying our best!” TK interjected. “I uh… I think…” she exchanged a long, searching glance with Alyssa, neither of them finding an answer to that dangling sentence.
</p>
<p>
	“There will be a full report of your wrong-doings on your desks by tomorrow morning.” The boss said, leaning forward in her chair and steepling her fingers together in front of her face menacingly. Smoke poured from her lips like a perfectly timed movie special effect to make her seem even more demonic as she grinned afterward.
</p>
<p>
	“Wait! Wrong-doings?” Alyssa piped up, standing up and placing her hand on the desk in front of her. “What wrong-doings?”
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, I thought we just sucked at our jobs!” TK interjected and stood up as well. Alyssa held a hand up and waved at her to sit back down silently, shaking her head at her. TK sat down quietly and placed her hands together in her lap.
</p>
<p>
	“Tsk tsk tsk…. The two of you are just going to have to be punished for your actions before you ever fess up to them, I suppose.” The boss lady stood up and dusted her suit jacket off, straightening it with her palms. She took the cigarette from her mouth and tossed it haphazardly onto the table in front of her.
</p>
<p>
	The assembled group of old white men immediately began to scramble over each other, and over TK and Alyssa, to reach the cigarette in the middle of the table - like a bunch of farm animals on a feeding frenzy they clawed and pawed over each other to make it to it. TK and Alyssa withdrew back away from the table as fast as they could, Alyssa leaping away in disgust and TK rolling her smaller-than-usual chair backward as hard as she could manage.
</p>
<p>
	A heavyset old white man with a poorly disguised chalk white combover and mustache held the cigarette butt aloft in the air triumphantly and every other old honkey in the room slowly slid back away from him, grumbling and complaining under their breath as they took their seats again.
</p>
<p>
	“Shall we…?” the boss lady was suddenly standing at a door across the room the two of them had never noticed before. It made sense there was a door in here, of course, how else could they have gotten in to this meeting? But why didn’t either of them ever notice before now that it existed? Both felt a little too self-concious to verbalize it. Not to mention whatever the fuck had just happened with the decrepit old board officers around them having shaken them up a little.
</p>
<p>
	“What the fu…what just…?” TK muttered to anyone who would listen as she stood up shakily from her chair, staring wide-eyed at the old man sitting on his hands and knees in the middle of the board room table holding a still-smoldering cigarette butt aloft in the air above him reverently.
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t even know what to say about this shit…” Alyssa said flatly, turning away from the meeting room entirely and hurrying out the door that the boss had been ushering them to exit with. She didn’t even look back as she went out into the hallway, having lost all desire to struggle against her mental fog or understand what the fuck was going on at all by this point.
</p>
<p>
	“Alyssa!” TK chased after her, catching a glimpse behind her as she exited the room of the board member holding the cigarette butt shoving it into his mouth with one swoop of his hand and swallowing it down, still smoldering inside of him releasing small bits of smoke through his nose and mouth. She tried to hold back the disgust in her throat as she turned the corner into the hallway.
</p>
<p>
	“He ate the cigarette…” TK whispered to Alyssa as the two of them walked side by side down the long, spiraling hallways of this building they both should know very well by now but neither even slightly recognized.
</p>
<p>
	“God damn….” Alyssa shuddered a bit, holding the bridge of her nose with two fingers. “What the fuck is even going on here? What are we DOING here?”
</p>
<p>
	“Selling baked goods?” TK smiled half-heartedly. Alyssa just shook her head stone-faced.
</p>
<p>
	“Well, here we are.” The boss said finally, standing next to a glass-inset door that read “Corrections & Punishments” on it. She turned the knob and stepped inside, leaving the door partially open for the two of them to follow her inside. “Please come in.”
</p>
<p>
	“...do companies have a punishment department, usually?” TK asked, scratching the back of her head absently. 
</p>
<p>
	“Amazon does, I heard. If you piss in too many bottles they break your legs or something.” Alyssa returned flatly.
</p>
<p>
	“....is that what we did?” TK asked, her anxiety overwhelming her at this point. “I think I’d remember if I pissed in ONE bottle let alone enough to get my legs broken.”
</p>
<p>
	“Come in, I said!” their bosses voice shattered their line of questioning immediately and TK hurried as fast she could through the door, gripping tightly onto Alyssa’s arm to drag her inside with her.
</p>
<p>
	Whatever the two of them had wondered would await them in the Corrections & Punishments room had not prepared them for what they would find waiting for them.
</p>
<p>
	Torture racks with gigantic turning cogs on either side, hanging leather belts from the ceiling, long pleather swings in each corner, slabs of stone crotch-height in a semi-circle around the center of the room, and walls covered in shelves lined from one end to the other with dildos, vibrators, buttplugs, sybian machines, whips, chains, ballgags, and so much lube that you would have to stop for a second and wonder - is this company buying BULK lube? Where do you even buy something like that in bulk from to begin with? They don’t carry that shit at Sam’s Club, do they? But then again, there’s an entire industry about fucking and sucking on camera that has to get their lube from somewhere, right? It’s not cost effective for a production company to buy those normal little bottles of fuck-lube - they would HAVE to get it in bulk from somewhere right?
</p>
<p>
	Uh… anyway…
</p>
<p>
	Standing in the middle of this reddit incel’s wet dream come true was the boss they had followed down the long hallways this entire time - but now she looked quite different. Her long blonde hair was free-flowing down around her shoulders and she wore a black pleather mask on her face and reflective black lipstick. Beyond the pleather boots and bicep-high gloves she was wearing there wasn’t a single stitch of clothing on her body anymore - besides maybe the belt she had strung across her waist with the world’s largest red-hot glowing, smoking, flaming dildo which was illuminating the entire room from it’s blasting bright glow.
</p>
<p>
	“Ready for your punishment, girls…?” the boss said with a wicked toothy grin behind her black lips, tilting her head forward and raising her eyebrows up and down real fast like Groucho Marx.
</p>
<p>
	“AGHHHHHHH!!” TK screamed out, turning to run as fast as she fucking could toward the door behind them, but finding it closed and locked up tight somehow when they weren’t looking. She looked back at the arm-sized flaming dildo once “AUUUUGGHHH!!” she began yanking on the door handle harder, placing a foot on the door jamb for leverage as she tried to wrench it open.
</p>
<p>
	“Hold on a fucking second!” Alyssa yelled out, causing the boss to loose her horrid smirk and TK to stop yanking at the door to stare back at her. “You can’t FUCK your workers when they mess up at a real company! None of this shit seems real, actually! What the hell is going ON here?”
</p>
<p>
	“Whaddya mean?” the boss asked.
</p>
<p>
	“Well the real world doesn’t have giant FLAMING dildos as far as I know! Nobody would WANT that! Sure big, but on FIRE?” Alyssa grimaced.
</p>
<p>
	“Well, it IS a punishment.” The boss said matter-of-factly.
</p>
<p>
	“That would KILL someone, though! Alyssa’s right, this is totally some kind of weirdo dream or something!” TK yelled out, then paused, placed her hand over her mouth for a second, glancing awkwardly at Alyssa, then uncovered to quickly add, “Nightmare. I mean nightmare.”
</p>
<p>
	“Good addendum…” Alyssa said with a raised eyebrow.
</p>
<p>
	“Well either way you may as well lose the business suits so I can defile you for funsies. I mean for punishment. You’ve done bad sales at this very real company or whatever.” The boss was seeming to lose interest in whatever was going on here with their awakening.
</p>
<p>
	“WHOA!” TK yelled out in an amalgam voice once more, her eyes widening and becoming bright inhuman glowing blue. “I finally got through, dude! SHEESH there’s some real interference happening in this noggin, bruh, what’s even…”
</p>
<p>
	Dips inside of TK’s consciousness looked around the room then, seeing all the various and sundry fuck-materials and things that needed to go in this orifice or that one, and finally laid eyes on the hyper-dominatrix in the middle of the room with the fake burning leg-dick and stood transfixed in shock for a moment or two.
</p>
<p>
	“What the FLIP is goin’ on in here, dude?!” DipsTK yelled out, flailing his arms in the air around him. “I thought you two were gonna get killed in this illusion and junk, dudes, but you’re in here gettin’ dommy mommied instead? MOST uncouth, my dudes!”
</p>
<p>
	“How the fuck did you break into my illusion?! Who ARE you even?!” the boss screamed out, her entire body beginning to flicker and shift like a candle that was burning out slightly. In its place was the horrifying combination of woman and moth that brought every lost memory crashing back into Alyssa and TK all at once.
</p>
<p>
	“That’s it! We’re inside of some kind of nightmare illusion!” TK yelled out in her own voice, grabbing Alyssa by the shoulder with the revelation.
</p>
<p>
	“What the fuck do we DO then?!” Alyssa grabbed onto TKs shoulder as well, the two of them in a little mini-huddle in the middle of this disgusting ass corporate sex dungeon.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh for FUCKS sake! You would’ve liked the punishment god damnit! We all would’ve got a nut!” Miller screamed out, unaware of how fucked up this entire godamn thing was vis a vis consent and general human decency.
</p>
<p>
	“Yo I got an idea dude!” Dips burst back into TK all at once, illuminating her eyes and changing her voice again. “I’ll just hop, skip, and jump into the moth lady and turn the brain-drain off of her and you guys’ll be back in the waking world, bro!”
</p>
<p>
	“Fat fucking chance!” Miller screeched, her wings unfurling into their gigantic true scale and her body raising up into the air above them. “I don’t know what you are, but I am perfection incarnate! I am the ultimate Crysalid! I AM the true face of Gestalt! And none shall ev–”
</p>
<p>
	And just like that, the illusion was gone. TK, Alyssa, and Dips snapped back to reality instantaneously, the dimly lit alleway behind two sets of houses they had been taken from into that terrible sexy corporate nightmare was back. The three of them blinked their eyes hard to adjust to the sudden reality of their situation, but before even seeing anything, they heard their savior.
</p>
<p>
	“FUCK YEAH!!” screamed Jason as the top of his lungs, his hands gripping tightly around the haft of his silver-tipped firemans axe as it buried it’s bladed end directly into Miller’s horrific insectoid face, all the way to the mid-point of the metal. The flesh around where the blade had punctured into her immediately began to bubble and rot away from it, as it had done every other time it had found purchase in a Crysalid’s meat. “EAT THIS SHIT, FUCKFACE!”
</p>
<p>
	“She’s still swinging, Jason, you can’t just stand there!!” Dev screamed out, flailing his nerdlinger arms in the air like a virgin Kermit the Frog (Kermit absolutely fucks and you know it) to get his new friends attention. Best friend, maybe? He sure hoped!
</p>
<p>
	But the warning came a little too late, as Miller had swiped her gigantic insectoid clawed hand into Jason’s midsection, “FUCK!” he screamed, the blow sending him flying head over heels like a discus into the picket fence on one side of the alley. The wood buckled but didn’t splinter, bouncing his limp body off of it and onto the asphalt of the alley heavily.
</p>
<p>
	“Our heroes…?” Alyssa said absently, rubbing her eyes at the Looney Tunes bit unfolding in front of her.
</p>
<p>
	“Are you ok?!” TK yelled out, running across the alley and skidding to a stop on her knees next to Jason’s barely-moving body. 
</p>
<p>
	“Fuckin’... cheap shot…” Jason mumbled as he pushed himself up front the ground to his unsteady full height. He was pretty shocked when he felt two people wrap their arms around his midsection and steady him up on his feet. “Huh…?”
</p>
<p>
	Dev was underneath his right arm, struggling to hold the much larger’s man’s weight up but smiling up at him as best he could manage, “I gotcha big guy…!”
</p>
<p>
	TK was under his left arm, managing an uneasy and weak smile herself as she held him aloft much easier than the smaller guy on the other side. “You’re the two guys that Dips saw being tortured under the old building! You’re why we’re here in the first place!”
</p>
<p>
	“What? For REAL? You’re why we didn’t just escape once we got free! We stayed cause Jason wanted to help you!” Dev cried out in disbelief that he’d been roped into this at all now.
</p>
<p>
	“Well thanks for the attempt….” Alyssa groaned out, walking backward to join up with the rest of the group near the fence. She was staring straight at Miller who was flailing around violently and screeching but didn’t seem to be all that hurt for someone with an ax in their face.
</p>
<p>
	Miller flung it’s gigantic clawed hand up at the ax and sent it flying over the fence into the distance from the force of her blow. The massive gaping wound in her face, that was once bubbling with the violent after-touch of the silver, was now knitting itself back together as she screeched and threw her weight around violently. 
</p>
<p>
	“What the fuck?!” Jason cried out. “That ax burns these things alive when I hit ‘em! What fucking gives?” 
</p>
<p>
	“I’m not sticking around to find out, let’s fucking go already!” Alyssa screamed, turning and running toward the fence and leaping up to it. She grabbed onto the top of it and turned around, perched on her Doc Martens like a bird of prey, and held her hand down to TK.
</p>
<p>
	“You can run, right?” TK let go of Jason and he nodded to her, prompting her to charge up to the fence herself and take a running leap. She made it about half as high as Alyssa but caught her hand just the same. Alyssa yanked her up and over the fence and dropped her on the other side, leaping off the top of it herself and landing in the grass beside her.
</p>
<p>
	“Wh-uh…?!” TK cried out, looking over at Alyssa, “You left them?!”
</p>
<p>
	But just as those words left her mouth, a pair of brown work boots hit the grass next to her followed by the knees of a set of mechanics overalls, the head of a nerdy engineer, the back of a set of mechanics overalls, and then the ass of a nerdy engineer. Jason had leapt to the top of the fence as well, boosted Dev up and over it, and had landed just as Alyssa had before.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh I.. uh… I knew he could do that, so…” Alyssa waved it off, standing back up and running full speed across the grass of the lawn, away from the screeching sounds of the healing horror behind them.
</p>
<p>
	“H-hold on, I’m coming too…! Not all of us are born athletes!” Dev cried out as the entire group took off running, leaving him a league behind with their combined foot-speed. Every so often along the trip, Jason would slow down and grab onto Dev, pushing him to run harder to keep up with the rest.
</p>
<p>
	No one ever questioned the multiple-blocks run the group was on, all much more conscious of the fact of what they were running away from to give a shit about where they were running to. All but Alyssa, anyway.
</p>
<p>
	She turned the corner and saw the goal - her Dodge Charger parked outside of her uncle’s house they had been staying in all this time. This only put the spring in her step even further, causing her to close the block’s distance between her and the car in world record time.
</p>
<p>
	She fumbled the keys out and unlocked it quickly, motioning for the rest of the crew to get into the car as well. Dev dove into the front seat, yelling “SHOTGUN!” without a second thought. TK shook her head in shock and disbelief but got in the back seat behind Alyssa as she slid into the driver’s seat and turned the key. The charger purred to life instantly.
</p>
<p>
	Jason stopped outside the back passenger side door, and looked back in the direction they had run from. The wings of the horrific moth monster were so large that he could see them even here waving in the wind of its own power. The screeching had turned from tormented and pained to filled with endless rage. He keenly felt the absence of his ax as he stared for a moment.
</p>
<p>
	“Here bro, you dropped this, man.” a voice came from behind him.
</p>
<p>
	Jason turned around and immediately saw his bloody, gleaming ax being held out to him and all the tension and loss in him bled away instantly the second he grasped the handle and held it aloft. “Holy shit, thank you!” he cried out, turning his eyes back to the man who had handed it to him.
</p>
<p>
	But he did have to raise his eyes higher up than usual. Y’see, this man was floating off the ground in front of him, glowing an incandescent blue, and grinning at him from ear to ear behind a pair of equally spectral sunglasses. Jason, for the first time in his life, was face to face with an actual ghost.
</p>
<p>
	“Wuh…. hu….how….what are…” were all he managed to stammer out before a hand reached up out of the car and yanked him into the passenger side back seat in one violent pull. 
</p>
<p>
	TK held onto his jacket for a moment as she pulled him into the car, glowering at him as best she could, “We GOTTA GO, dude!!” she noted that she hadn’t spent a lot of time in her life saying ‘dude’ before Dips had taken her over twice now. She would bring that up to him later.
</p>
<p>
	With all parties inside the car, including Dips who decided it was best to remain invisible for the time being, Alyssa bent the gas pedal to the floor and peeled the fuck out all super cool and fuckin’ sick like, taking off down the street at 77 mph in a 25 like the badass she is.
</p>
<p>
	No one spoke a word until the car had passed the Whitesville City Limits sign, riding in complete silence until that very moment.
</p>
<p>
	“So uh… ghosts are real too, huh…?” Jason asked weakly, never even once in his life even debating with himself about the existence of ghosts or not. That was like dorky ass bitch thoughts. Like Dev thoughts.
</p>
<p>
	“Wait, what?!” Dev said excitedly, turning around in his seat and peering over the back of his headrest at Jason. “You saw a ghost?! So neato, you gotta tell me about it!”
</p>
<p>
	“Yo little bro, I can tell you about me just fine!” Dips interrupted, appearing in the backseat between Jason and TK.
</p>
<p>
	“FUCK!” Jason lurched away from him all at once, then let out a heaving breath and settled back down into his seat. “Don’t fucking DO that!!”
</p>
<p>
	“Or what, bro, you’ll kill me?” Dips said with a gnarly surfer dude laugh to boot. Jason cracked a smile and shook his head.
</p>
<p>
	“Wow, I know there’s a real life ghost there and everything… but that might be the first genuine smile I’ve ever seen Jason make!” Dev said with a wide grin of his own.
</p>
<p>
	“You’ve known me for two days, man!” Jason grimaced in return. “I haven’t had a whole lot of time to smile recently.”
</p>
<p>
	“So whats your fucking deals, anyway?” Alyssa finally piped up, annoyance in her voice suddenly obvious for having taken on two complete strangers and almost died for it.”
</p>
<p>
	“Well…” Jason began.
</p>
<p>
	—----------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	They had been on the road for about an hour by the time each of them had finished telling their part of the story to one another. YOU on the other hand already know the whole godamn story cause you’ve been listening to me run my mouth for an entire season of it so I’ll skip rehashing all this old shit. If you DON’T know what they said, then fuckin’ go listen to all the other episodes ya god damn NUT.
</p>
<p>
	For some reason or another none of them felt the need to hold anything back from one another. There was complete honesty in that car ride and it didn’t feel like too much either. They felt unburdened, each and every one, to tell their stories.
</p>
<p>
	“Whoa, bro, that’s mondo bogus.” Dips said, placing a spectral hand on Jason’s shoulder. “But maybe violent revenge isn’t the only path forward, ‘yknow? Maybe there’s a zen chill way for you.”
</p>
<p>
	Jason stared at Dips with an incredulous look on his face for a moment before shaking his head, “If I don’t kill these things for what they did to Archie, they’ll just keep doing it to other people. Other little brothers. Other families. There’s no other way forward for me, ghost boy. It’s all this now.”
</p>
<p>
	“Uh… Dips.” Dips corrected him.
</p>
<p>
	“You like that better than Ghost Boy, huh? Alright…” Jason replied.
</p>
<p>
	“We’ve just been driving aimlessly for over an hour now…” Alyssa interrupted, still behind the wheel of the Charger. “What do we even do now? We have no idea where to go anymore.”
</p>
<p>
	“You heard the moth lady though! She said she was going to Arklay. We just gotta figure out what Arklay is!” TK interjected herself. 
</p>
<p>
	“Well uhm…” Dev started and then rubbed at his chin softly. “I actually know exactly what Arklay is already.”
</p>
<p>
	“How in the fuck do you know that?” Jason groaned out, already sick of the last minute surprises Dev kept pulling out of his ass.
</p>
<p>
	“I told you that I hacked their computer systems and memory banks before! I learned a ton about Gestalt and especially all of their hidden bases. I thought it was super neato cool that anybody in the real world could have a hidden base!” Dev pushed his oversized coke-bottle glasses up his face. “I know that one of those bases was called The Arklay Mansion. I’m not entirely sure of the exact location but if I can get to my house and access my hard drive then I can give us the pinpoint place!”
</p>
<p>
	“Fuck yes!” Jason cried out, pumping his fist in the air. “You’re a genius, Dev!”
</p>
<p>
	“Aw shucks!” Dev replied bashfully.
</p>
<p>
	“Hold the fucking phone!” Alyssa interrupted. “Your plan is to just drive up to this horror show’s secret base? Should we all batter and spice ourselves first or do you think they’re gonna do that for us?”
</p>
<p>
	“I gotta agree with Alyssa.” TK said a little more meekly. “I know you wanna stop these guys for what they did, but we don’t have any way to do it right now…”
</p>
<p>
	“What about your powers, dude?” Dips asked TK, leaning his ghostly elbow on her shoulder all cool and after-school-specialy. “You could blow their whole mansion off the map lickety-split, bro!”
</p>
<p>
	“I have no idea how to even use them! They’re…” TK paused for a moment, rubbing the side of her head where she felt a pretty deep migraine forming already. “They’re terrifying. I’m not me when they happen… I have no control.”
</p>
<p>
	“Is there someway we could help you gain control? Some kind of expert we could talk to?” Dev said, being totally new to this entire psychic power thing and defaulting to what he knew how to do - learn and grow.
</p>
<p>
	“Who do you figure we should call, Dev? Houdini? Miss Cleo? Mob Psycho 100?” TK asked flatly.
</p>
<p>
	“I dunno…” Dev responded crestfallen.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m sorry, I just don’t know what the hell to do and it’s making me pretty pissy.” TK said as softly and kindly as she could.
</p>
<p>
	“You’ve been through a ton this past week, TK. No one blames you.” Alyssa reassured her.
</p>
<p>
	BBRRRRIINNNGGGG
</p>
<p>
	“Wuh…?” Jason immediately began digging around in his jacket pockets - side ones and then inside one, before he pulled his hand back out with a busted up cellphone in it. “My fucking phone still works…?”
</p>
<p>
	The display was cracked to the point he couldn’t see who was calling but decided to answer anyway for the convenience of this story. No one in the real world ever would at this point so chalk this one up as a plothole, I don’t fuckin’ care. He flicked the answer slider and held it up to his ear. “Hello?”
</p>
<p>
	There was a pause for a second as Jason’s face twisted in disgust and recognition.
</p>
<p>
	“FLINCH?! Where the fuck have you even BEEN?” Jason yelled into the phone, the other four in the car exchanging confused glances. “Alright…? Yeah, I mean… look I don’t… I DON’T CARE WHAT PERCENTAGE YOU GOT IN DONKEY KONG COUNTRY! WHERE. ARE. YOU?”
</p>
<p>
	There was another long pause as Jason rolled his eyes and kept trying to interject but couldn’t. “Fine yeah, yeah. No, I…. I don’t wanna say hello to your friend, Flinch. She’s saying she’s not your friend and I can hear her RIGHT now, dude. Just fucking… just.. Alright. You’re where again?”
</p>
<p>
	He paused and rubbed his hand over his face from top to bottom in one aggravated sweep. “Alright, we’ll meet you then. We don’t know where we’re going at the moment but you have my number and I have yours, I’ll turn Find My Phone on.” He paused again. “Fucking… you don’t know… you don’t know Find My Phone? No it’s… no it’s not a fucking… LOOK. HERE.” He shoved the phone into Dev’s hand and made an overdramatic motion with his own hands for the nerdier guy to take over.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh just cause I got multiple degrees I’m IT now huh…?” Dev grimaced, but Jason gritting his teeth at him made him immediately put the phone to his ear. “Uhm, hi, I’m Dev, I’m a friend of Jason.”
</p>
<p>
	There was a long pause, “O-ok… 101% without the players guide, huh? That’s… that’s impressive.” He paused for a moment again, “Ok…. ok you know Find My Phone right? No… n-....no it’s… it’s not… it’s on your phone, Mr. Flinch. No, it’s not…. It’s not… you don’t have to… NO IT COMES WITH THE PHONE, MR. FLINCH!! You have to… go to… at the bottom of the screen there’s a little bubble that says ‘Search’. Yeah… click on that. And then you type in… what? What do you…?”
</p>
<p>
	Dev paused for a moment and then became red faced all at once, “I DIDN’T SAY TO SEARCH DEEPFAKE PORN OF ANYONE! NO I DIDN’T! I DID NOT!” he paused for a moment and collected himself. “Please just type in “Find My Phone”. Ok… can you… no don’t… you don’t need to…”
</p>
<p>
	There was a moment of panic on Dev’s face and then he spoke once more, “Heellloooo. My name is Dev, I’m a friend of Jason’s.” another short pause, “Ok… not a friend of Flinch’s… got it… unfortunate circumstances keep throwing you together, sure, I get that.”
</p>
<p>
	There was a much longer pause this time as Dev just simply nodded to what he was hearing, and then finally, “Ok then! Just follow the Find My Phone signal and we’ll meet somewhere before morning! Excellent! Thank you so much! I look forward to meeting you!”
</p>
<p>
	There was a short pause then.
</p>
<p>
	“H…hello…? Huh, must be a bad signal.” Dev handed the phone back to Jason who put it into his jacket pocket once more.
</p>
<p>
	“Well we just need somewhere to go now.” Jason opined.
</p>
<p>
	“Alright, who the fuck was that, even?” Alyssa interjected. “We’re meeting someone now?”
</p>
<p>
	“That was Pavlov Flinch, a private dick that stunk of cheese and sulfur. I accidentally hired him to help me find my brother thinking he was a real detective.” Jason said, leaning back into his seat contemplatively. “Gestalt is looking for him for some reason and I’m hoping he can clue me in as to why. We don’t know jack fucking shit at this point and if you want some kinda plan we’d best start by getting some kind of information.”
</p>
<p>
	Alyssa drove on silently.
</p>
<p>
	“I think he’s right, Alyssa. I know you’re not psyched about teaming up with people we don’t really know so well but they’re in this too… whether any of us like it or not.” TK said sternly.
</p>
<p>
	“And I do NOT like it, I’d like that to be put on record.” Dev said, half-jokingly.
</p>
<p>
	Alyssa smiled slightly at the joke but shook the expression off her face. “Fine then. Where are we going?”
</p>
<p>
	“We’re going to Dev’s house in Buffalo.” Jason stated plainly. “If he really does still have the info on the Arklay Mansion then we need it and we need it quick. Flinch and whoever the fuck was with him will have to meet us there.”
</p>
<p>
	“Great, cool. We’ll drive two states over. Sweet.” Alyssa said grumpily. TK reached up into the front seat and placed her hand on Alyssa’s shoulder comfortingly. The two smiled at each other for a moment before returning to their worried expressions once they were no longer maintaining eye contact.
</p>
<p>
	“I think we’re a team now!” Dev interjected excitedly. “I’ve never been part of a team in any way before, this is pretty exciting! What do you think we should call ourselves?”
</p>
<p>
	Dev didn’t expect anyone to answer that immediately, since he was used to being the only hyper-excited hyper-fixated nerd in any given situation outside of AV Club in college, but Jason immediately piped up
</p>
<p>
	“The New Spooky Squad.” he said without inflection.
</p>
<p>
	There was a moment of silence as everyone else in the car exchanged glances.
</p>
<p>
	“Uhm… not to poo-poo the first idea but what are we, The Candle Cousins? Are you planning on writing a series of children’s mystery books with that name too?” TK said with a slight chuckle, trying not to be too mean but still get her point across.
</p>
<p>
	“That’s what my brother Archie and his friends called themselves. The Spooky Squad. They investigated mysteries and the paranormal…” Jason smiled distantly, staring out the window at the trees whipping past their car. “Seems appropriate.”
</p>
<p>
	There was silence again in the car, but this time much more individual and contemplative.
</p>
<p>
	“I second The New Spooky Squad.” Dev said with a smile back at Jason. Jason nodded to him in return.
</p>
<p>
	“Yo I think The New Spooky Squad is straight up baller, personally, dude. I’m on board HARD.” Dips said with a slap on Jason’s shoulder. Jason tried not to show how weirded out he still was by a ghost being involved in all of this.
</p>
<p>
	“I’ll fourth that name then. It honors the memory of your brother and that’s good enough for me, regardless of the name. I’m sorry I joked about it. “ TK said with a smile.
</p>
<p>
	“The New Spooky Squad it is.” Alyssa said quietly, focusing only on the road ahead of them.
</p>
<p>
	They were all mostly quiet then, knowing how long of a drive they had ahead of them. But for the first time in a long while they all felt like they were exactly where they were supposed to be.
</p>
<p>
	The End
</p>
