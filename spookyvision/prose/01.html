	The stars began to fade as the sun came up over the lake. Birds started chirping their shit talk. A mirkmonk went back into his tree presumably to mouth hump his hot mirkmunk wife. That one song from cartoons played as the sun began to rise higher in the sky and the moons passed in front of each other's orbits to make it look like one sweet celestial booty.
</p>
<p>
	"This sucks gremlin groin" Billbert Dinglesmith thought to himself. He reeled in his fishing line and cast again. On the end of the line a sentient worm screamed in sheer terror as it flew through the air faster than any of his ancestors could ever dream.
</p>
<p>
	"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
</p>
<p>
	Plop.
</p>
<p>
	Out of a nearby tree the mirkmonk emerged.
</p>
<p>
	"HEY. QUIET THE SHIT DOWN OUT HERE WITH THE FISHING AND THINKING BRO. I JUST GOT MY SON TO BED HE WAS UP ALL NIGHT WITH BAD ANXIETY FARTS! HE HAS A CONDITION! FUCK! ITS BEEN QUIET AROUND HERE FOR LIKE 8 YEARS AND NOW THIS GUY IS FISHING AND THINKING AND THIS WORM IS YELLIN AND I"M JUST TRYING TO SAVE MY MARRIAGE FOR GODS SAKES. PLEASE RESPECT MY PRIVACY AND NEED FOR QUIET IN THIS TIME. DICKHEAD."
</p>
<p>
	Billbert continued to fish long into the early morning. The lake was crystal clear. Not even Urinus, the god of piss, had set foot in this part of Daranos. It was untouched like your mom until last night when I came over and wrecked her shit. Call me "Narrator Daddy". Now go mow the lawn. It's Wendesday.
</p>
<p>
	"All I wanted was to catch one fisting ass fish...this sport SUCKS! I hate it and anyone who does it is stupid and boring." thought Billbert as his stomach growled as loud as a Darnosian Yeti. You know, the really big ones. The ones with 3 dicks.
</p>
<p>
	"razzle frazzle fishing stupid mother frazzle razzle gods damn"
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly Billberts line began to jerk and twerk. 
</p>
<p>
	"Oh" he said outloud. "Oh my a fish!?"
</p>
<p>
	Excitedly Billbert pulled back on the rod and with all his strength he pulled and pulled. Being careful not to break the line or lose the fish, he pulled with all his puny might. Finally the water broke as Billbert fell back into his dingy. Out of the water arouse the biggest tittied mermaid he had ever seen. I mean these things were MAMMORIES to remamber. To be fair he had never seen a mermaid so the fact he was seeing her boobs was preeeeetttty cool.
</p>
<p>
	"Hello" she giggled. "I am Laguna. Guardian of this pool and unofficial life guard on weekends."
</p>
<p>
	"Whoooooooooa a lifeguard" Billbert stammered.
</p>
<p>
	"Since you have summoned me," Laguna continued, " I am obliged to give you one wish...."
</p>
<p>
	"FISH AND CHIPS" Billbert yelled out without hesitation.
</p>
<p>
	"what... Imean...wow" Laguna replied in surprise. "I mean usually people like ask for better things and not stupid things? ya know? Like maybe you want to take a minute and think it over?"
</p>
<p>
	"FISH. AND. CHIPS" Billbert said firmly. This fuckin guy was serious about his fish and he wasn't going to waste this oportunity.
</p>
<p>
	"Well ok I mean" Laguna begain again. "See like usually I get asked for big wishes. Like a sword that can cut through armor, or an all see ball that lets you see everything plus it makes everyone naked, or even like a whole big pile of fuckable gold. But little wishes like this I'm not so good at. I have a rockin bod with amphibian bolt ons but little wishes tend to be tricky"
</p>
<p>
	"Please" Billbert begged. "It's my wife's birthday and I promised I'd get her her favorite meal. She loves fish and chips and she is a good mother and wife. I only want to make her day special."
</p>
<p>
	Laguna sighed. "Fine" One magical fish and chips. Once finished this plate will refill itself again. You and your household will never go without fish and chips again. Now please never come back here because you're hte weirdest guy I've ever met."
</p>
<p>
	And with that Laguna blew a whistle. TWEEEEEEET. 
</p>
<p>
	"Everybody OUT OF THE LAKE ADULT SWIM. EVERYONE OUT OF THE LAKE ADULT SWIM"
</p>
<p>
	Billbert looked down at his wish. An amazing plate made of gold and silver laden with huge crispy chunks of fried fish as gold as the plate itself. A golden aura of magic eminated from its fishy essence. Next to the fish were every kind of french fry imaginable. Curly fries. McDarnold's type fries, Chicken Fries, and even steak fries if you're a fuckin degenerate and into that sort of thing and want to eat 1/16th of an entire potato at once ya Fuckin weirdo fuck.
</p>
<p>
	Billbert bit into a piece of fish. Instantly he three'd himself. The golden batter the fish was fried in tasted like a child's dreams. The flakey crust crumbled in his mouth and melted onto his tongue with a buttery sweetness one could only describe as "vaginal".
</p>
<p>
	The fish itself was perfectly moist and crumbly. When he bit into it he could almost hear it giggle and then moan? He couldn't tell where his mouth began and the fish ended. All of existence seemed to pass him by. He saw his ancestors who were just peasants and really boring but it was cool to see Nana again. That bitch was wild.
</p>
<p>
	Before he knew it, he had eaten the entire plate. Dude must have camed like 6 god damn times. Billbert quickly stuffed the now empty plate into his sack and rowed back to shore. "
</p>
<p>
	"I have to get home and tell Milly about this. She's gonna have the best birthday ever"
</p>
<p>
	One his way back home Billbert decided to stop at the local tavern named "The Titty Twister". Titty's are a kind of bird in Daranos, get your mind out of the gutter you sick piece of fuckin shitty shit.
</p>
<p>
	Bellying up to the bar the bartender poured him a pint of mead. "Ah mead...the fish and chips of beer" THought Billbert as he put the pint to his lip hole. 
</p>
<p>
	But no liquid came pouring out. Billbert looked into the mug and saw like 49 god damn steak fries just clogging that thing up. No mead to be seen.
</p>
<p>
	"What the shit" he thought. "Hey Barkeep whats the idea here?" He said as he looked up. Around the tavern everyone else seemed to be just as surprised as all their drinks were replaced with steak fries. The rowdy group began to become and more rowdy and horny for answers.
</p>
<p>
	"WHATS ALL THIS DEN" yelled one orc
</p>
<p>
	"OI FUCKIN STEAK FRIES INNIT?" yelled a mirk elf.
</p>
<p>
	"IF I WANTED STEAK FRIES I'D JUST EAT A WHOLE POTATO" yelled Goblin
</p>
<p>
	Billbert was confused. He opened his pack. Yes the plate was there but it was still empty. How long did it take for the fish and chips to respawn he wondered. Do I need to like...say a magical word or like do a ritual.
</p>
<p>
	By now everyone in the Titty Twister was full blown pissed that their booze had turned into varying types of fries and fish.
</p>
<p>
	The gang started to yell. Bottles were tossed. Salads were tossed. A Blobbit was thrown through a table where he died no one ever knowing how good he was at Orcsketball having it been a tall mans game and no one ever giving him a chance.
</p>
<p>
	Just as the fervor grew to its breaking point Billbert spoke up.
</p>
<p>
	"I kind of like steak fries" he said meekly.
</p>
<p>
	The crowd went immdiately silent. A single glass fell from the bar and shattered on the floor. A troll in the background yelled "OOOOOOOO now you fucked up"
</p>
<p>
	The Big Orc from two paragraphs ago slowly turned to look at Billbert. 
</p>
<p>
	"You....WHAT?!" he said firmly
</p>
<p>
	"I mean I dont know they're kind of good" Billbert said plucking a steak fry from his mug and biting into it.
</p>
<p>
	"Look little man. If I wanted your opinion on SHIT I'd go ask you what sex with your wife is like because I'm pretty sure its SHITTY."
</p>
<p>
	" I mean give them a chance" BIllbert said with his mouth full as he extended a single fry toward the orc.
</p>
<p>
	The Big Orc slapped it away.
</p>
<p>
	"If I wanted to eat an entire potato at once I'd DO IT. BECAUSE I"M AN ADULT. Oh do you want to put ketchup on that fry? GOOD LUCK. You're gonnna need an entire bottle just to cover one fry. Then you keep chewing and chewing until there's  nothing but starch in your mouth. Tastes like I'm eating sand out of a sand monsters asshole AND I"VE EATEN SAND OUT OF A SANDMONSTERS ASSHOLE"
</p>
<p>
	"HEY DON"T YOU TALK ILL OF SANDMONSTERS. MY DAD WAS A SANDMONSTERS" a half sandmonster half cat man said from the back. 
</p>
<p>
	Instantly all hell broke loose. Orcs were breakin bottles over dude's heads. A dog man was straight up howling on the bar while calvin and hobbs style pissin on a steak fry. By now everyone had their weapons out and the sound of smashed steak fries could be heard for miles. Blood was everywhere but it still wasn't as gross as the smell of steak fries.
</p>
<p>
	Billbert thought this was the time to leave. He grabbed his pack and a halffull of steak fries for the road and made his exit. Soon he would be home.
</p>
<p>
	As he entered his wife and kids greeted him with hugs and kisses. 
</p>
<p>
	"Oh honey you're home" said wife of Billblert who's name isn't imporotant because I'm  not making another name up.
</p>
<p>
	"You would not believe the day I had" Billbert said setting down his sack. He pulled out the golden silver plate which was still empty.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh I love it" his wife said smiling.
</p>
<p>
	"It's a magic plate that makes fish and chips. Your favorite" he said with a small smile. "But it seems to not be working. I got it froma lifeguard mermaid with bolt ons so I think I got scammed"
</p>
<p>
	"Oh honey" his wife said. "I love anything you get me. I dont need it to be fish and chips. Now why don't you go to bed and I'lll.....JOIN you in a minute" she said winking at him.
</p>
<p>
	As Billbert lay in bed thinking about his day his wife slowly slid into bed with him. 
</p>
<p>
	"Maybe I could insterest you in a little DESSERT?" she said smiling.
</p>
<p>
	Billbert knew what that meant. He was gonna get to mouth kiss his wife's birthday hole. But as he slid down beneath the covers he could see a faint glowing golden light. 
</p>
<p>
	"No..." he thought. He could smell them. Steak fries. He was being dutch oven hot boxed by steak fries.
</p>
<p>
	"NOOOOOOOOOODFSDIFJOSDIJFOISDFJ" his scream muffled and then....silence.
</p>
<p>
	THE END?
</p>
