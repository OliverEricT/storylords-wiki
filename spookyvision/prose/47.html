	Prompts: Signposts & Underworlds
</p>
<p>
	“I dunno, I think that violates my clients confidentiality.” Pavlov Flinch said vacantly, his yellow watery eyes staring in the middle-distance, focused on nothing, as usual. “There’s an amendment about that, I think. The 13th?”
</p>
<p>
	“I’M your fucking client, dipshit!” Jason Grace screamed out at him, his fists gripped at his sides tight enough to almost draw blood from his fingernails digging into his skin just to keep from knocking this little gremlin’s head off his weak, knobby shoulders and ridding the world of a living STD on it’s proverbial ballsack.
</p>
<p>
	“And yet you still haven’t paid me the other half of my retainer. Doesn’t sound much like a good client to me, huh?” Flinch returned with all the unearned caustic bravado of a 3rd grade spelling bee champ, which is about where his literacy level floated most days.
</p>
<p>
	“We’ve been at this for fourty-five minutes!” Dev Durwood the Third chimed in, slapping his own cheeks with both hands hard as hell like I slapped your mama’s nasty ass dumptruck fulla lumpy potatoes while I was wailing on her with my big thick ass masher in the back of the Ore-Ida Potato Factory down on 5th on her lunch break. Nice of the owners to give her a job as a cum rag given her age and medical history, by the way. Dev continued, “Just tell us why Gestalt was after you for information in the first place!!”
</p>
<p>
	“The salt…? My doctor says I can’t have too much salt anymore or it’ll make my kidneys explode out of me like a chestburster.” Pavlov answered evenly, bringing his can of Surge up to his lips and downing half of it in one gulp. How the fuck did he get Surge? When is this fucking story even set? Who knows.
</p>
<p>
	Jason, Dev, TK Kanzaki, and Alyssa Medero sat where they’d been sat for the entirety of this off-screen comical farce I’m not bothering to write - in a semi-circle around one of the motel rooms they’d rented out at the Motel 69 after meeting up with Flinch and his mystery friend. Jason had a towel draped over his wet head and was wearing a pair of loner purple pajama pants with little crescent moons all over them that Dev had brought from home - the made it to just past his knees. His clothes were in the washing machine down the hallway, having been caked with so much mud that morning that he could barely move in them anymore after it hardened. This was the fifth, and hopefully, final cycle.
</p>
<p>
	“This is getting us nowhere, just let me beat it out of him.” Alyssa growled out.
</p>
<p>
	“I vote for that too.” Pavlov piped up instantly.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m gonna go ahead and veto, then.” TK said with a lip upturned in disgust.
</p>
<p>
	“You gotta know how to get information out of him, it’s like working with a toddler.” a sixth voice piped up from the doorway. In a slow camera reveal from the floor up (that’s stage direction for when we fully sell out and turn this into a sick ass CW show btw), we first see a pair of heavy Doc Marten boots, then some old faded dark bluejeans, a heavy leather jacket with fur at the collar, and then the ever-annoyed and put-upon face of last season’s main heroine - KAYLA S. HUNTER. 
</p>
<p>
	That’s right boys and girls, she’s back! I didn’t even make a big deal out of it by dragging it out like movies and TV do with returning characters to show how important they are, I was just like POW there she is! That’s really brave of me, I think. It just goes to show how good of a character she is that I didn’t belabor the point at all, I didn’t do a whole spiel about how important she is or how she saved the world or anything I was just like BOOM she’s here and she’s part of the story now! Fuckin’ QUICK AND CLEAN baby! Not like those terrible WOKE TV shows and moves. I don’t know what woke means in this context and won’t look it up but I assume me saying that won’t cause any undo harm to the podcast or my friends Rich and Josh’s reputations. Anyway, Kayla’s here.
</p>
<p>
	“If he still won’t fess up, THEN you beat it out of him. Like an adult.” she said with a smirk.
</p>
<p>
	“I just don’t understand the question. I’m not sure why that qualifies me for a beating I won’t get any sexual gratification from.” Flinch whined.
</p>
<p>
	“Nevermind,” Kayla said plainly. “I wanna stress I’m not affiliated with him, even slightly. Life keeps punishing me by making me deal with him. I gotta assume I was some kinda serial killer cannibal in a past life or something. I miss it compared to him.”
</p>
<p>
	“SHUT THE FUCK UP AND START TALKING, FLINCH!” Jason screamed out at him. Everyone in the room exchanged glances for a moment. “You… you know what I mean, damnit! Why did the evil organization we’re chasing down want you to begin with?”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, Gestalt, the evil organization! Why didn’t you just say that to begin with?” Flinch chided. The vein in Jason’s forehead looked like it was going to pop out of him like a kidney out of Pavlov Flinch after his next Big Mac, but Flinch carried on. “They kept saying something about alien blood or something, they couldn’t get enough of the stuff. I guess they were running low or something and thought I could detective up some for ‘em. I’m really the best in the business, don’t believe the Yelp reviews. Or the Google reviews. Or the graffiti at the bus stop next to the 7-11.”
</p>
<p>
	“What the fuck is this melting troll doll talking about?” Jason flung his head around to look at Kayla, who had her face in her hand already.
</p>
<p>
	“Thankfully, I kinda know what he’s dancing around like a drunk dad at a shotgun wedding.” Kayla said as her hand slid from her face and she composed herself. “The two of us stumbled into an encampment of Acolytes of the Third Birth, a nasty doomsday cult that was trying to bring about some kind of eldritch space horror’s birth. In the tent we hid in there was the corpse of something not human - and jars and jars and jars of it’s purple blood. From what you’ve all told me about these Chrysalid things - it looks like they need the purple blood of one of these things to make more of ‘em. Flinch saw where they were keeping it before, Gestalt knew about it somehow, so they tried to track him down for the info.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh I told ‘em.” Flinch remarked casually. When every set of eyes in the room landed on him instantly, widened in disbelief, he shrugged over-dramatically, “WHAT? The cops asked me what I knew! Was I supposed to lie?”
</p>
<p>
	“The cops work for Gestalt.” Jason muttered to Alyssa, TK, and Dev.
</p>
<p>
	“No shit Sherlock. And I thought the fat Toby from The Office was the detective in the room!” Alyssa snapped back.
</p>
<p>
	“Whoa, whoa!” TK jumped up from her seat on the side of the bed, stepping between Jason and Alyssa just as Jason rose from his seat at the end of the same bed - it was a motel room, there weren’t many places to sit.
</p>
<p>
	“What the fuck is your problem?! You’ve been biting our heads off the entire way here!” Jason said, trying not to get too fumingly angry for a change.
</p>
<p>
	“She didn’t mean anything by it!” TK said, trying to play peacemaker.
</p>
<p>
	“The Office…? That show that’s set during the 70’s?” Flinch asked.
</p>
<p>
	“That’s That 70’s Show.” Dev responded flatly.
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, that’s what I’m saying.” Flinch returned.
</p>
<p>
	Dev stumbled a bit, “N…no that’s not what I’m–” 
</p>
<p>
	“Alright! I’m going to bed!” Alyssa threw her hands in the air and walked through the motel room, around everyone to the door and waited there, hands still in the air, for Kayla to move out of her way - and she did, holding her own hands up in a mock gesture as she stepped aside. Then Alyssa slipped out the door, and turned down the hallway to head for the other room they had purchased for the night.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m sorry guys she’s just…” TK tried to explain but gave up just as quickly, awkwardly smiling as she made her way through the crowded room towards the door as well. “Ex..excuse me… let me slip by you… sorry, sorry… ok.” She stopped by the door to the room and turned back. “I’ll talk to her. She’s just not used to being in a group, is all.”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s not all it’s cracked up to be, I get it.” Kayla said sarcastically, looking away from the others out the window. Her eyes were met with a monumentally gigantic rotating glowing yellow signpost reading “Motel 69 - Where Your Dreams Happen Because You’re Asleep When You Have Them ™”. She recoiled at the sight.
</p>
<p>
	“We’re leaving at 6 tomorrow, right?” TK awkwardly tried to steer the conversation back to her leaving.
</p>
<p>
	“Bright and early! We’ve got a short way to go but we got no idea what’s waiting for us there! The Arklay Mansion is in upstate New York, in the middle of the woods. The whitest of white people country. I wouldn’t trust it.” Dev said with a grave look. He then looked around at Jason and Flinch, two honkeys in their midst, and smiled graciously, “Present company excluded, of course.”
</p>
<p>
	“Nah, I completely understand.” Jason said, waving him off.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m 1/16th Cherokee.” Flinch said flatly.
</p>
<p>
	“Well… goodnight. See you all tomorrow.” TK said with a forced smile on her face. She turned to leave and awkwardly half-nod-half-bowed at Kayla before hurrying out of the door with a quick, courteous “Ms. Hunter.”
</p>
<p>
	After a moment, Kayla spoke in a quiet voice, “That girls wound tight as all hell. Is she always like that?”
</p>
<p>
	Jason and Dev exchanged glances. They hadn’t known her long enough to really make any call, they both realized at once.
</p>
<p>
	“Knock knock!” a voice came from the open door, causing everyone to jump and look in that direction. An old couple, both white and in their sixties with completely white hair, both wearing polo shirts with Motel 69’s logo on the left breast pocket.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s Bud and Louanne Burrman again!” The man, apparently named Bud, chimed in sing-songy. He held a menu in his slightly shaking hand, his other hand pushing up his gigantic square-framed glasses. “We thought your Polycule could use a late night snack before bed! Gotta keep your strength up with so many holes to fill!”
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t we know it!” Luanne said with a shake of her head and a smile. “Besides, more fuel for the fires of hell once you all end up there for eternity!”
</p>
<p>
	“That’s what I always say!” Bud said with a chuckle.
</p>
<p>
	“FOR THE LAST TIME WE’RE NOT A FUCKING POLYCULE!” Jason screamed out, his teeth gnashing in his head.
</p>
<p>
	“So that’s completely off the table…?” Flinch questioned quietly.
</p>
<p>
	—-----------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	“Alyssa…” TK pushed open the door to their room, finding Alyssa sitting in front of the vanity mirror brushing her dark black hair out with an old beat-up hairbrush. “We really need to talk.”
</p>
<p>
	“Everybody’s favorite phrase.” Alyssa said tersely, before raising and dropping her shoulders all at once to try to expel the frustration from her. “Sorry. Yeah, you’re probably right…”
</p>
<p>
	TK sat at the foot of the bed and criss-crossed the fingers of her hands together, rocking her legs back and forth awkwardly from nervous energy coursing through her veins. “I know you said you didn’t wanna do this back at Dev’s but…”
</p>
<p>
	TK paused a moment, feeling suddenly very drowsy all of the sudden, as if the fatigue of their long journey had started to wear on her finally. 
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah?” Alyssa’s voice cutting in instantly brought TK back to her senses.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, sorry… I just can’t walk away from this. There’s been… well.. It’s kinda hard to explain but…” TK rubbed at her eye, the deep sleepy feeling dragging at her to give up the conversation and go to bed instead, but she fought. “I keep having these… visions. You know what I am… what I can do. And these visions, they’re… they’re real. I know they are.”
</p>
<p>
	“What are you talking about? What kind of visions?” Alyssa’s anger had melted completely into concern now. She stood up from the table and walked over to the bed, sitting down next to TK.
</p>
<p>
	“I see this… white room. It has these dark recesses all along the walls, like fissures but perfectly symmetrical, you know? And it’s so bright in there… it hurts to be in there, like something is eating away at me…” Tk fiddled with her fingers to try to keep focused, the sound of her own voice somewhat distant and hazy in her weariness.
</p>
<p>
	“In the room there’s always someone else… something else? I don’t know… “ She rubbed at her eye again, the feeling of lifting her arm being so disconnected from her own feeling of it that she barely registered it happening. “It called itself Nil… and said it was the one behind Gestalt. I can’t… I can’t run away from this because.. It’s already… IN me, Alyssa…”
</p>
<p>
	Alyssa sat in silence for a moment, leaned forward with her elbows on her knees and her face in her hands. She had wanted to just go home and pretend like none of this had ever happened. Not because she was a coward.. But because of what it was doing to TK. What it could possibly DO to TK. Maybe she was doing what she’d always done with her. What she’d told herself she couldn’t ever do again when she decided to break it off to begin with - trying to run her life for her.
</p>
<p>
	“Alright…” Alyssa began, sitting back up straight. “We’ll go. You and I… we’re in this together, you know? Like… like before. When we were…” Alyssa turned to look into TKs eyes but was instead met with empty air in front of her. She looked down to find TK laid out sideways across the bed asleep, a little bit of drool pooling at the edge of her mouth already from the complete absence of consciousness. “When we were together….” Alyssa said flatly.
</p>
<p>
	—-------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	“You have to eat your peas, dear.” TK’s mom said with warmth in her voice, spooning a small spoonful of peas onto the perfectly white dinner plate in front of her daughter. “You wanna grow up big and strong, right?”
</p>
<p>
	“Wh… M…mom…?” TK managed to choke out, her voice high and whiney and almost unrecognizable to herself. She looked around the room, terror gripping her heart amidst the sudden confusion for some reason, until her eyes landed on a mirror across the hallway from the dining room. She was reflected there, in her old wooden seat at the table, barely 8 years old.
</p>
<p>
	“Listen to your mother, pookiebear.” TK whirled around at the voice, the memory of it flooding into her like a damn breaking. Her father was seated across the table from her, spooning a heaping spoonful of mashed potatoes on his plate. He smiled a wide, adoring smile as their eyes met, but it made TK’s stomach sink instantly.
</p>
<p>
	“This isn’t right…” she muttered to herself below her breath, her chest beating so hard in her chest that it hurt. “This isn’t right!” she yelled out, trying to push away from the table but finding her arms not strong enough to move her. Her legs completely held in place by some unseen force.
</p>
<p>
	“Now, now, pookiebear, you’re scaring your little brother…” TK’s mom said with a practiced, soft chiding tone. She picked up a small spoon with a teddy bear on the end of it and spooned out some mashed potatoes into the waiting mouth of a small, cooing baby boy in a high chair next to her. 
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, Teresa… you don’t want to hurt your baby brother, do you?” TK’s father said with a small laugh.
</p>
<p>
	But his voice began to echo into infinity then. On and on the laugh stretched until it was a long, ceaseless droning and everything around TK had begun to move at the most barely imperceptible crawl - slowed to near motionlessness. 
</p>
<p>
	Each of her family members looked at her with adoration in their eyes as some unseen force radiated out from her vision, white and thin and glittering in the low house light. Their faces all distorted away from her almost imperceptibly, then drew in. And agonizingly slowly, as if frame by frame but in such smooth, unclipped motion, their skin began to peel away from the muscle beneath their faces. 
</p>
<p>
	They stared at her, unblinking, unseeing, but screaming in a type of pain that very few humans have ever experienced. TK tried to scream out but nothing came out of her throat, only the same power within her that surged and swam through the air, ripping the flesh away from the bloody, squirting muscle beneath their faces, their necks. Their clothing began to burn and twist in the air and then even the meat that made up the shape of their faces - faces she could suddenly barely remember, began to rend and tear from the bleached white skulls beneath. Everything about her home was suddenly burning and twisting and being pushed away as if a bomb had gone off in the exact spot where she was sitting. Her family was atomized in the force she had created. Her home was burnt into ash and scrap in the force she couldn’t control.
</p>
<p>
	TK Kanzaki was standing in the middle of the rubble of her home, the distant sound of sirens dull and droning on the air as ash and flame wisped around her back to the ground. In the strewn wood and soot of what was once her family sat a small teddy bear spoon, upturned, with mashed potatoes running into the dirt next to it. A single eyeball in the ash staring up at her unblinking. Tiny and bright brown, dimming.
</p>
<p>
	—-------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	“Alright, you’ve told me everything I need to hear about this.” Kayla Hunter said with authority in her voice. She leaned on her long silver metal cane as she stood in the center of the room holding a hand up to stop the information coming at her.
</p>
<p>
	“So you’ll help us?” Dev said with hope in his voice. “We could use someone with your world-saving expertise on our side! I didn’t wanna get anyone down in the dumps but I computed only a 2.375 percent chance of success given our current groups.. Ah.. shall we say… suckitude?”
</p>
<p>
	“No, I won’t be helping, kid. I’m gonna be taking over. You all go home and go back to your regular lives. I’ll handle this myself.” Kayla said, narrowing her eyes at Jason and Dev. “You can pack up and head back in the morning. The biker chick will be psyched about it, she hates you nerds.”
</p>
<p>
	“Aw man I thought a girl liked me…” Dev said with head hung low. “As a friend I mean!” he added quickly, pointer finger in the air.
</p>
<p>
	“You haven’t even gotten friendzoned with a girl yet…? Sad, bro.” Flinch shook his head with pity.
</p>
<p>
	“What the hell are you talking about?! I’m not going home until I’ve stopped these maniacs and avenged my brother! Did you miss that part of the story?” Jason snapped, standing up from his seat at the end of the crusty ass motel bed where people fuck your mom at lol.
</p>
<p>
	“You don’t even have the right tools, kid!” Kayla snapped back, holding her cane up and immediately sliding the blade hidden inside of it out, the shining silver edge of it glinting in the nearly-burnt out halogen ambience of the room.
</p>
<p>
	“You wanna fucking bet?!” Jason growled, kneeling down and yanking up his duffel bag, unzipping it indignantely and pulled out his woodsmans ax - the same silver edge glint happening in the light for it.
</p>
<p>
	“Wha… you’ve got a silver weapon? How the hell did you get your hands on that?!” Kayla looked the ax over with wide eyes and disbelief on her face mixed with some genuine anger it ended up in the hands of some kid.
</p>
<p>
	“My dad gave it to me.” Jason said without a hint of honor or mirth behind it. “I could lob the head off any monstrosity with this bad boy before… but now it can’t even dent these things. I have no fucking clue what even happened. Still… it’s gotten me this far, it’s gonna get me my revenge.”
</p>
<p>
	Kayla took a mental note that his kid had introduced himself as Grace. That answered any follow-up questions she happened to have. Instead, she tilted the cane’s scabbed toward Jason and the light behind him.
</p>
<p>
	“You gotta clean it, numbnuts. Your dad didn’t give you a sheath for that thing? With this stuff inside?” Kayla said. Jason peered into the scabbard with narrowed eyes and saw a strange, green, slightly bubbling liquid inside of it and recoiled away all at once.
</p>
<p>
	“That’s… cleaning fluid..?” he asked, incredulously.
</p>
<p>
	“Fucking hell, kid…” Kayla shook her head. “Here… I’ve got more at home.” She tilted the scabbard up and carefully poured about half of the strange, burbling green liquid over the metal head of the axe, the liquid sizzling as soon as it touched it before laying flat like a new layer of sheen on top of it - hardening instantly. “Good as new.”
</p>
<p>
	“Fuck YES dude you gotta be shitting me, that’s all there is to this? I thought I’d fuckin’ voided the warranty or something!” Jason smiled from ear to ear, brandishing the axe around carelessly for a moment before catching himself being a little too childlike and vulnerable in front of people and stopped immediately. “So uh… ahem… that means we’re going with you then. Why else would you help me get battle ready, huh?”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m always shooting myself in the fucking foot…” Kayla growled under her breath, shaking her head. “Yeah, I fuckin’ guess.”
</p>
<p>
	—---------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	TK was standing in the white room again. The deep halogen hum of unseen bulbs rattling in her head and her eyes straining against the blinding emptiness surrounding her.
</p>
<p>
	She stumbled for a moment. She couldn’t remember her parents faces any longer. She had JUST seen them. Seen what she had done to them. She hadn’t remembered what they looked like for well over ten years but suddenly the absence was so much more painful - seering at her mind like a hot iron.
</p>
<p>
	“You are lost.” a familiar robotic voice filled her mind to its brim and hurt her head - the pressure behind her eyes of it inside of her thoughts threatening to pop them from their sockets but she endured. “Like Orpheus in the Underworld.”
</p>
<p>
	She turned slowly to find the same man sitting slumped over in a chair in the center of the room in the same tattered old labcoat. The same corpse as always.
</p>
<p>
	“We are your salvation.” the voice continued. TK turned her eyes to the other end of the room, but there was suddenly no space from there to here and she was only a few feet away from the floating, flickering, faceless, featureless being that spoke to her. It had only black, empty slits where eyes would be, its entire body jumping and jittering with electronic feedback from moment to moment. 
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t understand… I can’t… I can’t remember… who are… we…?” TK groaned as she held her head in her hands, shrinking away, slowly sinking into the humming white light. The warmth enveloped her and she could suddenly no longer see or feel much of anything at all.
</p>
<p>
	The voice followed her down, so distant and indistinct but seared into her very last thought. “You and I…. we are Nil.”
</p>
<p>
	—----------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	“PLEASE!” Alyssa screamed out at the open door the other hotel room, startling Jason, Dev, Kayla and Flinch. “I couldn’t stop her! She just left! She was cold as ice and she just left!”
</p>
<p>
	“What’s going on?!” Dev cried out, as he and everyone else ran over to the door to follow Alyssa out into the hallway. 
</p>
<p>
	“TK ran off outside! I couldn’t follow her she was too fast! She was using her mind thing to lose me for some reason, why would she do that?” Alyssa was frantic, and turned and ran down the hallway toward the stairs out to the emergency doors. “She was completely out of it!”
</p>
<p>
	“I’ll meet you out there!” Jason called out, running down the hallway in the opposite direction to retrieve his clothing from the laundromat room. Dev nodded thinking Jason had something important and action-hero-y to do instead. He wouldn’t realize what had just happened for weeks. It would severely tarnish his viewpoint of Jason as an action hero coolguy.
</p>
<p>
	When the assembled crew got outside they saw a completely strange sight awaiting them. Across the parking lot TK was climbing into the driver's seat of a large Winnebago with the Motel 69 logo plastered across the side of it. She barely looked back at them, her eyes white and empty in her sockets as she passed them over with no recollection sparking in them,
</p>
<p>
	Climbing into the side door of the winnebago behind her were none other than Bud and Luanne Burrman from earlier, the proprietors of this disgusting shithole motel who thought are heroes were a polycule (which was pretty wild considering they’re old white ass boomers how do they know what that is? Did Fox News do a thing recently?), each of them with the same glazed-over empty white look in their eyes that TK was sporting.
</p>
<p>
	The engine roared to life as Alyssa ran across the parking lot as fast as she could, but she couldn’t close the distance in time. The recreation vehicle spun out backwards from its parking spot and then jerked heavily out onto the road, zooming down the highway away from the Hotel 69 at full speed.
</p>
<p>
	“They’re… heading toward… Arklay…” Dev huffed and puffed, completely out of breath from running DOWN stairs in a way very few young men are capable of being without some type of long term illness. 
</p>
<p>
	“FUCK!” Alyssa screamed out. She paced back and forth for a moment, growling out her frustrations. “What is going ON?!”
</p>
<p>
	Jason finally caught up with them, back in his heavy brown boots and fur-collared blue jean jacket. Kayla pointed to the fur on her collar and then at Jason's, nodding. Jason did the ‘oh yeah’ look on his face and nodded as well. This meant absolutely nothing to the story.
</p>
<p>
	“Fuck it, I’m all in.” Alyssa growled out, running across the parking lot, leaping onto the hood of her car and sliding across it. She threw the drivers side door open and leapt into the front seat, grinding the engine one hard and throwing it into gear. She spun the car back around like a top to stop it inches in front of the assembled group.
</p>
<p>
	“FUCKING shit!” Jason yelled out as everyone jumped back away from it with him.
</p>
<p>
	“Everybody in the god damn car! NOW! We’re going after her! I’m not losing her again!” Alyssa screamed from the front window of the car.
</p>
<p>
	Jason and Dev leapt in as fast as they could, while Flinch tried to slip off without any of them noticing. Against her better judgement Kayla grabbed him by the collar of his stupid cosplay detective jacket and flung him into the backseat before leaping in after him.
</p>
<p>
	The car rocketed out of the parking lot and onto the road like it was barely touching the road, already cracking 90 by the time they had been wheels to pavement for only a few seconds. Alyssa gripped the steering wheel hard and narrowed her eyes as she drove.
</p>
<p>
	“This is what I do, so buckle the fuck up.” she said with bass in her voice. Everyone pretty instantly did what she said.
</p>
<p>
	The violent rumble of the wheels on the road filled the silence between them. Determination welled up in each of their hearts, together.
</p>
<p>
	—------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	“Uhhh…. TK…?” Dips asked hesitantly, floating just behind the driver’s seat that TK sat in mesmerized, driving full tilt in some random ass Winnebago he’d never seen in his life down a stretch of dark highway with the lights off. “Dude you uh… you ok orrrr…?”
</p>
<p>
	To Be Continued
</p>
