Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner but Not Racist(?)

Prompts: Junkyards & Bodybuilders

By Jeff Pennington


The car ride had gone on so long that TK Kanzaki had started to let her mind wander as they drove past empty land stretching into the distance only broken by high barriers of densely packed trees every so often. It had been a sort of malaise of boredom to begin with - one too many stories about Bigfoot being a part of the Illuminati but only the WCW version, not the WWF from Dev, one too many interruptions to bring up what life was like as a radical skateboarding 90’s ghost trying desperately to escape the endless weight of eternity from Dips, one too many frothy-mouthed, raging speeches about murdering Gestalt with his bare hands and avenging his fallen brother with the spilled blood of the guilty from Jason - it all started to wear on her eventually. But eventually it changed.


The change was so gradual she hardly noticed it. The flashing lights passing the car windows as the night wore on into morning gave way to the breaking dawn which only served to deepen her loss of time - to stretch out the hazy thoughts that slowly drug her closer and closer to sleep. Eventually the light had become so bright she could still see it through her closed eyes. And nothing seemed out of the ordinary for her in that numb, dull brightness.


Until she could hear the humming again.


She shot forward, reaching to grab onto the leather of the seat in front of her, for the comforting knowledge of place, of time, of proximity to Alyssa, but her hands found no purchase in the droning white light. She blinked hard against it, finally straining her eyes enough to see the dark black recesses between long white panels along the wall on each side of her, which seemed to stretch into infinity beyond her vision.


“No…” she whispered to herself, but her voice was unbearably loud, like a scream inside her own mind.


“I’m afraid so.” a monotone voice broke the reverb of her own speech and caused her to yank away from it with her whole body, spinning fast to face the direction it had come from.


In the distance, not very far from her, a familiar body sat slumped over in a wooden chair in the very epicenter of the room, draped in a white labcoat stained with age and wear. A corpse dangling over to the side at almost the point of tipping into the floor - desiccated beyond all recognition.


She stared for a moment. There was a silence, beside the endless droning hum of the halogen bulbs that hid behind every surface in the room.


“Who are you?!” she screamed out, terror gripping her voice and straining her throat.


“I am Nil.” the corpse spoke motionlessly, an emotionless voice emanating from inside of it far behind the empty, toothless, immobile mouth. “I was once Professor Thomas Amran. Now… I am Gestalt.”


Her body shuddered with waves of fear which paralyzed her, her head swimming and spinning beyond her control. She gritted her teeth and tried to steady herself, screaming at the top of her lungs against the humming, barely audible over it’s endless drone, “WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!”


“Your mind.” the voice echoed into forever, becoming louder and louder, merging with the vibrating, drilling hum of the electric lights, driving itself into her head like a lobotomists pike, until


—-----------------------------------------------------------


“TK!!” Alyssa yelled out, shaking TK by her shoulders awake as hard as she could, causing her to bump her head into the back of the seat over and over again. “Stop playing around, you’re scaring me! Get up!”


“Jesus, I’m awake! I’m awake!!” TK yelled out, grabbing onto Alyssa’s arms and stopping her from giving her shaken lesbian syndrome (Happy Pride Everybody!, Donate to The Trevor Project at give.thetrevorproject.org/mclasspodcast!). “ What are you DOING?!”


“You wouldn’t wake up! I’ve been trying to shake you awake more politely for like five straight minutes. What’s going on with you?” Alyssa asked with genuine concern in her voice. “First you go all Super Saiyan, then you decide we gotta join a Junior Justice League, then you do a third well-known pop culture reference to be added later, and now you’re going into miniature comas in the backseat of my car? You’re worrying the hell out of me.”


“I’m… I’m fine… I just… keep having nightmares, I think.” TK held her forehead, feeling a pretty heavy pounding headache forming just behind her eyes. She couldn’t remember why she had felt so scared a minute ago at all, but she felt a tremendous sense of relief she’d been awakened when she was anyway. “Are we at Dev’s?”


“Yeah, they’re waiting for us at the door. The garage is locked so we gotta go in the front way.” Alyssa scoffed, helping TK out of the car and shutting the door behind her. 


“Garage…?” TK questioned warily.


“Yeah, big time wiz-kid world-class computer hacker Dev Durwood works in his parents garage, apparently.” Alyssa shoved her hands into her leather jacket pockets and shook her head. “We’ve teamed up with a hopefully less problematic Revenge of the Nerds side character and a possibly more problematic De Niro in Taxi. To do what, I don’t even fucking know yet.” she analogied, being bound by the laws of never mentioning either Urkel or Family Matters in universe. A law with a harsher penalty than any Gestalt could begin to imagine.


“You seem on board, at least.” TK said with a bit of frustration in her voice. “Let’s just go.”


The two had a pretty cold walk up to the others who stood at the doorway to the Durwood house in Buffalo, NY finally. Dev reached up and pressed the doorbell and then turned back to the others and smiled reassuringly.


“The fuck are you ringing the doorbell at your own house for?” Jason asked, fuckerly.


“Oh my dad doesn’t like it when I let myself in. He thinks it makes it seem too much like I live here. He says that’s too pathetic even for me to advertise publicly!” Dev nodded sagely, still smiling.


Jason upturned his lip in disgust, “Wh..what the fuck? Your DAD said that to you?”


“Most uncouth, my dudes.” Dips the Radical Skate Ghost interjected, apparating from seeming nothingness to be standing between the two of them, his ghostly arms draped over their shoulders and his legs bent up to allow him to still float off the ground between them. “My daddio always said the best father-son moments were the ones shared in love and understanding, my guys. Perhaps your father could learn from my dad’s wise words before he drank himself to death in Pasadena in 94 during a most radical Nintendo World Championships.”


“Dips you gotta be invisible! You can’t freak out Dev’s parents!” TK whisper-yelled as she caught up to them outside the door. “So go to the void or hell or wherever it is you fucking go when you disappear! Pronto!”


“Harsh, bro, but ultimately? Both fair and understandable. Peace and chicken grease, my dudes.” Dips threw up the double bunga and slowly faded away into invisible nothingness like smoke dissipating in the dark.


“I really wanted to hear about that Nintendo World Championships.” Dev said flatly.


“Yeah.” Jason returned.


Finally, after this improbable amount of time since the doorbell had been rung, it opened, revealing standing behind it a middle aged woman with a warm, albeit confused smile, wearing a silk blouse and a pair of high-waisted dress pants over black buckled shoes. “Hello…? Can I help you… all?” She shifted her eyes around the group and finally landed on Dev. “Oh welcome home, Dev honey! Come on in! Bring all your uh… your friends with you!”


Dev and his mother Kacey had one long, happy hug together and then she ushered them all into the foyer. “Now take your shoes off, I don’t allow anyone in this clean house with their shitty sneakers and knock-off Gucci boots.”


TK looked down at the Gucci boots she’d saved up for over the course of eight months and heaved a deep heavy sigh. She slipped them off and set them on the shoe rack by the door next to everyone elses as they each deposited their footwear.


“We were just about to sit down to dinner, why don’t you all join us! We’re having gumbo tonight!” she ushered them further into the house, through the living room and past a set of professional style swinging doors for the large kitchen and dining room beyond them. As she did, she quietly whispered to herself, “Thank god I made a lot of it…”


“Oh uh, Mom, we’re not staying long! We’re just here to pick up some files from my hard drive and then we gotta take off!” Dev said in his usual chipper explanatory manner, smiling up at his mom. “Very important business to take care of!”


“Somebody drop their iPod?” a gruff, deep voice hit their ears all at once. Sitting at the head of the large rectangular dining room table was Devlin Durwood Jr., Dev’s huge gruff ass ex-football star father, with his brow lowered and his head bowed low like a bull waiting to strike. “Who the hell are all these people?”


“They’re my friends, dad!” Dev responded as if he didn’t notice his dad’s jabs at all. Jason curled his lip in disgust, however.


“Ha! Yeah right. You haven’t had a friend since your penpal Mei Ling got tired of you writing to explain the plot of Supernatural to her. They get that show over there too, dum dum! She knows the Winchester boys lore already!” Dev’s dad laughed by himself, everyone in the room exchanging uncomfortable glances with one another while he did.


“Alright, sit the hell down.” He motioned wearily for them all to take a seat.


“Yes, yes, everyone sit down and I’ll dole you out some delicious gumbo! It’s an old family recipe! Even keeps fat husbands who’ve aged out of their glory days happy, right Devlin?” Kacey smiled at Dev’s dad with a wry side-eye. He grunted.


“I’m sure we’d all love to, Mom, but we really must be going!” Dev chirped, uncomfortable speaking to his mom this way but trying to seem cool in front of the group.


“I don’t want to be an ungracious guest but we are kind’ve in a hurry, ma’am.” Jason backed Dev up, trying to smile as politely and as non-psychotically as he could.


Kacey stared at them with a slight twitch in her eye for only a moment.


CUT TO: The entire New Spooky Squad are seated around the table, bowls of gumbo in front of them, each one silently staring down at them as they eat, the only sound in the room the soft clinking of silverware against porcelain. This continued for like, 10 straight minutes of silence.


“So…” Devlin finally broke the silence, looking around the room at the strange ensemble. “Who the hell are you people, anyway?”


“Devlin!” Kacey snapped in return to him, but he just shrugged back at her.


“What? They’re a buncha freak randos and they’re in MY house, I figure I got a right!” Devlin returned, grumpily.


“We’re friends of your son, just like we already said.” Jason responded, side-eyeing the elder Durwood between bites of the delicious gumbo. 


“Horse shit. My son’s only friend is his subscription to Brazzers.” Devlin said with a shake of his head.


“DAD! I don’t subscribe to that!” Dev hurriedly corrected, his face beet red at the cheeks. “I don’t even know what that is!”


“I do.” Alyssa said, taking another bite casually.


“Devlin, please stop embarrassing Dev in front of his little friends.” Kacey said with daggers in her eyes at her husband. “Don’t make me go downstairs and get the D-I-V-O-R-C-E papers again.”


“D-Force?” Dips said, his head appearing next to TK. “That movie with the hamsters?”


TK jumped, letting out a much louder squeak than she would have liked. Everyone in the room turned their eyes to her.


“Ahhh.. ha ha… sorry, I just… I.. “ TK stammered, looking between Alyssa, Jason, and Dev for any kind of help.


“Farted real bad! She’s shy about it!” Dev blurted out.


Kacey upturned her lip in disgust but went back to eating. Devlin didn’t even react, still eating his gumbo with a sour expression on his face at the prospect of having to go through the whole will-they, won’t-they of divorce proceedings yet again. Dev flashed TK a thumbs up and a big smile candidly once his clever ruse seemed to diffuse the situation.


“Damnit…” TK whispered under her breath. Dips popped back out of reality instantly, with a small “Whoopsie”. Alyssa placed her hand on TKs reassuringly.


“I know you didn’t fart, don’t worry.” She said with a sly, playful grin.


“How did he know about that hamster movie?” Jason whispered, leaning over the table to TK a little, his hand blocking the side of his mouth that Devlin and Kacey were on. “Didn’t that come out in the 2000’s some time?”


TK shrugged. Alyssa placed her hand on her face and wiped downward in frustration at this entire day so far.


“Alright, I had about enough of all this nonsense.” Devlin said, sitting back in his chair. “Now what the hell is going on here and what has my blatant failure of a son done to discredit my family name THIS time?”


“Y’know what, yeah, I’ve had about enough of this shit, actually!” Jason said with a raised voice, sitting back in his chair as well.


“What the hell did you just say to me, boy?” Devlin grimaced, growling out.


“You’ve been shitting on Dev since we got here and I’m about fucking tired of it!” Jason growled back in return. He then stopped and blinked, a bit wide eyed, and turned to look at Kacey. “I’m uh… sorry for the harsh language, ma’am.”


“No, no, by all means.” She said fully casually, leaning back in her chair as well, and sipping on her coffee with raised eyebrows to see what kinda ugly ass mess was about to unfold at her dinner table.


“You can’t come into MY house, and–” Devlin began, but was immediately cut off.


“Hey FUCK you AND your house, buddy!” Jason yelled over him, pointing a long thin finger at him along the way. “Dev’s a great dude, he saved my damn life! I’m not gonna let you sit here and badmouth him in front of me – let alone the fact he’s your own god damn son! What is it with you fucking fathers anyway? What did any of us sons ever do to any of you fucking pencil dicked old fuckers?”


DIINNGG DOOONNNGGG


The front doorbell rang. Everyone at the table sat silently for a moment, the tension in the room still incredibly high but all of the momentum having bled out of it.


“I’ll get it.” Kacey said with an awkward, half-hearted smile, standing up and heading to the front door.


“Fuck YOU.” Devlin growled out under his breath, half-whispering at Jason, leaning toward him and pointing his butter knife at him with a little butter on the end of it. 


“No, fuck YOU.” Jason growled back in the same low cadence.


TK tried to reach across the table to motion for Jason to stop, but barely made it halfway cause of her short stature and the size of the table. 


Dev slumped down lower in his chair, trying to hide himself from the entire situation.


“Well looks like there’s one more for dinner!” Kacey called out, walking back into the kitchen hurriedly. “This fellow says he’s a friend of yours too, Dev!”


From behind her, through professional swinging double doors, stepped a tall man wearing a long, beat-up old black overcoat tied tightly around the waist, a pair of black pants, and black gloves which he slowly removed from his hands as he stepped into view. Long black wavy hair fell over his ears and his eyes sharply moved from one person to the next in the room.


“YOU!!” Jason screamed, leaping up from his seat at the table and lunging toward the black enshrouded figure, but Dev and Alyssa had both already circled the table to grab hold of him, dragging him back away from the figure with all of their strength. 


Kacey took a step away from the man, who solemnly bowed his head for a moment before looking back at the crowd.


“My name is Ryo Tachibana. And I -am- a friend of yours, whether you know it or not.” the man softly spoke.


“Let me go! Let me kill him!!” Jason screamed out, trying his damndest to break the grip both Dev and Alyssa had on him.


“Kill him…? “ Devlin said gruffly, leaning back in his chair and rubbing the side of his face absently. “This kid some kinda… mental patient, or…?”


“EEEEENNNOOOUUUGGGHHHH!!” Kacey screamed out, causing everyone in the room to freeze and look in her direction. She was seething, her shoulders raising and falling as she stood there silently.


A moment passed before she placed his palms out facing down and slowly let out a long, deep breath. “Ok… this is my house, still. And it’s dinner time. Now either we all sit down to have dinner together and act like reasonable, civilized people… or else.”


There was a long moment of silence then, each person exchanging wordless, worried glances with the next.


CUT TO: Everyone, including Ryo, were now seated around the table with bowls of gumbo in front of them, the only sound in the room the soft clinking of utensils against porcelain, complete silence between them otherwise.


“I’m gonna fucking kill you.” Jason whispered hoarsely, holding his fork up to his neck and pantomiming dragging it along from one side to the other at Ryo.


Ryo looked over to his side at TK who shrugged at him with an extremely awkward smile.


“What the fuck is even going on in my own god damn house?” Devlin groaned out under his breath, shaking his head as he spooned gumbo into his mouth.


“Devlin.” Kacey reprimanded. He growled under his breath again.


“Alright, I do actually have something to say.” Alyssa interrupted the awkward silence that followed. She turned in her chair toward Alyssa and took her by the hands, holding them at the end of her knees. “I don’t think we should be involved in any of this. This has nothing to do with us and we shouldn’t have gotten involved to begin with.”


“The fuck is THIS now?” Devlin yelled out.


“Devlin.” Kacey reprimanded. He growled under his breath once more, going back to eating.


“What? How do you figure none of this has anything to do with us? You…” TK looked around the room and then leaned in closer, whispering a bit. “You saw what I’m capable of doing. What I DID. They’re not gonna let me just walk away happily ever after now. They’re gonna Alien Autopsy me and Jonathan Frakes won’t even be hosting this one!”


“So we go on the lamb. I’ve been on the run before, you know that. The gang didn’t allow anyone to leave.” Alyssa consoled her, holding her hands tighter. “You and me, we can disappear. You know.. Together.”


“I…” TK began, taken aback by the sudden renewed feeling between them. But she snapped back to reality quickly soon enough. “I can’t just leave Jason and Dev to this. They need our help, we have to do something about these.. These people.. Their experiments. You didn’t see what they did to that man back in Kirby…”


“So we team up with THe Straight Boy Revenge Squad and drive on off to our deaths in the mountains somewhere, huh? What’s that gonna accomplish, TK? We’re the new hit conspiracy on r/bullshitbutIbelieveit?” Alyssa returned, her voice raised with frustration and emotion now.


“I’m gay.” Jason interrupted nonchalantly, spooning the last few bites of his gumbo into his mouth.


Devlin and Kacey turned to look at Dev pretty instantly.


“I’m straight! I’m straight! Don’t get your panties in a bunch about it.” Dev said, waving his hands in the air in the universal sign for ‘whoop de doo.’


“It’s cool you’re comfortable enough with yourself to tell strangers like that.” Ryo said with a smile and a nod to Jason.


“I’m going to kill you.” Jason returned.


“Yeah, my bad for thinking you’d be up for a little human connection.” Ryo said flatly.


“Hey.” Jason said abruptly, “I’m gonna kill you.”


TK ignored everything I’ve written for the last half a page, “Alyssa I’m not sure this is the right place to be talking about this.” She stood up from the table and pushed her chair in. “Will you please excuse us? We’re gonna step outside and talk. I’m sorry about this dinner, Mrs. Durwood.”


“Probably not gonna be Mrs. Durwood for much longer.” Kacey said flatly, waving at them to go on ahead.


Devlin growled under his breath.


Alyssa stood up as well and nodded at Kacey, and she and TK walked back toward the back door at the end of the kitchen in the next room and stepped outside, allowing the door to softly click shut behind them.


Jason stood up and slid his chair in hard and fast, walking around the table and grasping tightly onto the collar of Ryo’s overcoat. “We need to be excused as well. Sorry for leaving so soon, right buddy?”


“I fuckin’ guess.” Ryo said with a shrug, shoveling a couple more quick bites of gumbo into his mouth before laying his spoon down and standing up. “Grth dinner, by the way” he mumbled out around his mouthful of food.


Jason yanked Ryo through the double doors, through the living room, and across the foyer to release his jacket with a shove near the front doors.


“Put your fucking shoes on and let’s go.” Jason said coldly.


“Go where? I just got here. I didn’t even finish dinner.” Ryo said with disappointment in his voice.


“How the fuck did you even trail us? You didn’t even know where we were going!” Jason hissed out between his teeth.


“I took a bus.” Ryo said plainly. “You followed like the exact Greyhound bus route. I just got off when you turned off the highway and walked. I saw your car from the overpass.”


“Fuckin’... for real?” Jason groaned out. He shook his head as they both finished putting their boots back on and he harshly shoved Ryo’s shoulder toward the front door. “Just fucking go, god damnit!”


Once they were outside, Jason pointed down the street past where they had parked their car. “Just down there and down the next street is a junkyard. No one will bother us there.”


The two began to walk in silence toward where the car was parked, Ryo shoved his hands into his overcoat as he went. “What exactly are you figuring on doing, anyway? I’m not sure if you remember this but I turn into an indestructible Beetleborg kinda monster with swords on my arms and you’re like… a guy.”


“Oh fuck you, dude.” Jason yelled back at him, now jogging across the street to the car. He opened the back door and reached in under the back seat, returning with his prized silver-tipped ax and hefting it into both of his hands. He then held it up into the air to show to Ryo who was taking his sweet time catching up. “I’m gonna lob your fucking head off with THIS shit, you bug ass bitch!”


“Alright.” was all Ryo said in return, which only further fueled the burning rage in Jason’s gut as they walked the last street down the gigantic arched open gate of the 88th Street Pump n’ Dump. I probably did that naming joke before but fuck it who listens to this shit anything.


The two walked inside and headed down a long corridor of high junk piles made of various metal pieces, car hubcaps, and stacked tires. After only a short trip, Jason turned around and faced Ryo, hunkering down and brandishing his ax around in front of him with hatred writ across every feature of his face.


“I’m gonna relish chopping you into itty bitty pieces and chopping those pieces down even further, you fucking freak of nature.” Jason spoke through gritted teeth, slowly starting to walk toward his prey.


Ryo stood static, hands in his pockets, sizing the other man up and down. “Why are you so mad, anyway? I saved you from Snake. Saved your friends from the last three Chrysalids. Gave you time to escape. I’ve been a real guardian angel to your whole crew. You just some kinda ginger psychopath or what?”


“You… you fucking killed my brother Archie..!!” Jason screamed out with every raging fiber of his being, lunging towards Ryo with his ax held high.


THUD!!!


The axe held fast, its metal blade draped harmlessly over top of Ryo’s raised arm, the wooden haft pressed hard against his forearm.


“Uh… no?” Ryo finally responded. “I don’t even know what the hell you’re talking about!”


—----------------------------------------------------------


Devlin looked over at Dev, who was still slumped down in his chair, pretending he was anywhere but this awkward ass dinner all his friends had bailed on.


“So you’re just gonna let your redhead roid rage friend talk to me like that?” Devlin leaned over closer as he spoke. He then leaned back in his seat. “Figures.” he sighed heavily.


“I can’t control what they do or say, Dad. They’re their own people and all. Plus they’re all way bigger and tougher than me, I’m not trying to get shoved into a locker at 24, I can’t imagine that would look good on a phD application.” Dev sat back up to his normal height.


“STRONGER!? You gotta be kiddin’ me! You’re a Durwood! If you’d just do some lifting and stop cybersexing Nigerian princes on AOL then you’d be able to hand an ass-whoopin’ to anybody on your worst day!” Devlin cried out, genuine shock on his face. “We’re goin’ to the basement gym, right fuckin’ pronto. I gotta work off some of my boiling murderous rage from being spoken to with what I label as unearned disrespect from someone younger than me. I am a boomer after all.”


Devlin stood and basically lifted Dev up like a suitcase and tucked him under his arm, stomping off down the hallway from one end of the kitchen to the basement stairs and down below. Devlin Durwood Jr. was a retired football player after all, so this house had all the luxuries and amenities his CTE lawsuit settlements could afford. Shame about the intense mood swings and inability to do basic math, though.


The basement was outfitted with tons of lifting equipment - barbells, dumbbells, bowflexes, lifting machines for arms, legs, chest, you name it. But Devlin walked directly over to the benchpress and dropped Dev onto the floor like a sack of old clothes. “Here we go.” he gruffly stated.


He then looked down at Dev who had landed on the floor in that exact beat-up ass Yamcha pose, you know the one, and yanked him back up to his feet. “Break it up, kid, you’re embarrassing me and no one’s here.”


“Dad, I’m not a strong guy! This isn’t my thing!” Dev finally protested, rubbing his head as he stood. “I’m more of a lover, not a fighter! Well…. Ok I’m more of a third thing. An unknown third thing that’s also good. I imagine.”


“Dev… look, son…” Devlin placed his hand on Dev’s shoulder tenderly. “Shut the hell up. Lift this heavy thing.”


The elder Durwood shoved the younger down onto the benchpress and set some weights onto the bar before sliding it into the slats above Dev and motioning for him to lift it.


“I started out with this little baby weight when I was like 12 so I’m sure you can handle it since you’re post pubescent and all.” Devlin chuckled. Then paused. Then narrowed his eyes looking at Dev up and down.


“I am!” Dev cried out, breaking the silence.


“I know, I know!” Devlin yelled in return. But narrowed his eyes at his son once more, tilting his head.


“There’s no way I can lift this…” Dev swallowed hard, staring at the weight above him. He figured through the power of his overdeveloped nerd ass dweebington brain’s mathematical abilities that the weight on the bar was almost 200 pounds. That was almost 180 pounds more than he could lift!


“Pssst… yooo… little nerd dude!” a familiar haunting voice hit Dev’s ear, causing him to jump slightly, but thankfully Devlin was flexing what was left of his football man muscles in the mirror at himself and didn’t notice. Dips apparated out of the floor next to Dev, smiling a wide, ghostly smile at him.


“Dips! What are you doing here?! You’re supposed to be keeping out of sight!” Dev whispered as quietly as he could at the spirit next to him.


“Whoa little dweebus, only you can see me right now, so don’t have a conniption, dude. I’m totally gonna help you put one over on your pops, though, bro!” Dev grinned a devious grin. “Just go to lift that bad boy and leave it all to me, dude!”


Dev smiled awkwardly, not quite trusting this dead child he met yesterday as much as the ghost fancied him to, but also not wanting to burn any bridges or hurt any feelings. “Uhm.. o-okay…”


“HURRY THE HELL UP, I’M MISSING MAUDE!” Devlin yelled out, grasping onto the bar to spot Dev and egg him on.


“Heh… here goes nothing… “ Dev placed his hands on the bar above him, closed his eyes, and pushed.


—-----------------------------------------------------------------


Jason had been swinging his ax fruitlessly at Ryo for a few minutes now, huffing and puffing as he screamed bloody murder with each swing.


Ryo dodged as fast as he could, barely missing a painful slash every time and losing his patience. He was beginning to feel a familiar beastial feeling raise up in his gut and was trying as hard as he could to repress it.


A set of ever-vigilant slitted eyes watched in the darkest shadows of the junkyard as the fight unfolded before them. The blood behind them boiled with a thirst for revenge that threatened to take away all other thought.


And the rain slowly began to fall.


To Be Continued
