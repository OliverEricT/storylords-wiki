The Candle Cousins in “Final Lessons”

By Jeff Pennington

Prompts: Keys & Feasts

“Keep up, Kristy, we’re almost there!” the girl in front yelled back behind her, hands cupped around her mouth. She was thin with fiery red hair pulled up into pigtails, heavy metal braces on her teeth, and a pair of denim overalls layered over a FAR too early Christmas sweater set her apart from the forest unless you were colorblind in which case she was practically camouflaged.

“Stop calling me that you little chode!” the other girl snapped back, trailing behind some ways out of apathy and annoyance at her companion far more than lack of desire to catch up. She was dressed head to toe in black with fishnets, studs, and leather boots with a My Chemical Romance shirt and a pleather jacket topping it all off. Now SHE looked completely fucking out of place in the woods, you couldn’t miss her even if you were born cursed to never truly know color like I am- I mean.. Fuck, alright. Get it together.

“You’re so silly Kristy, you know my name isn’t Chode! It’s Peggy!” the girl in front responded in a bubbly, spittle-filled tone, rocking back and forth on her heels waiting for her companion to catch up.

“Kristy was the name my stupid idiot parents gave me back when they shit me out my mom’s ass, Peggy. I told you from now on my name is Kristiana Blackheart Malaria Bloodwraith. “ Upon catching up, she shoved Peggy back a step, which did nothing to sour her disposition at all, and scoffed. “You can call me Kris if you MUST be stupid and straightedge about it. Kris is a type of cool knife.”

“Um… ok.” Peggy rubbed her arm where Kris had pushed her and turned to keep walking. Before summer break the two of them had been completely on the same wavelength - they wanted to be amatuer slueths and solve paranormal mysteries like those cute 40-something year old boys on Buzzfeed whose names I’m not writing in this story for copyright purposes. Oh fuck I wrote Buzzfeed right there… uh…Beesfeed. Phew, saved it.

Anyway, both girls were 14 and were once the absolute best of friends but Kristy had come back after break and said she’d not only had a cigarette, probably one of the worst sins in the whole bible, but that she was changing EVERYTHING about herself! Now she only listened to bands with fonts that looked like blood on their album covers and wore nothing but cheap Hot Topic merchandise that wore out within a month. All of this was meant to be anti-establishment, maybe? Or anti-life or something? Either way you would probably go straight to h-e-double-hockey sticks for even MENTIONING it in Sunday School - which according to Peggy was at LEAST five times more holy than regular school since it took place at God’s house. Regular school had like five times more America in it though, so it was pretty equal.

“What are we even doing out here, anyway? This is so lame and cringe and duxant - there’s not even any beer which I actually like and drink.” Kris said with all the inflection of a 1st grade reader, but on purpose.

“Uhm, I’m gonna pretend you didn’t say the... the B word… we’re out here to find a ghost! Don’t you know anything about Farrow Woods?! It’s only the most haunted place in the world! It’s straight out of an episode of Spooky Squad!” Peggy rambled to set up later exposition.

“Ew you’re talking way too much, my mom didn’t say you’d talk this much when she gave me five dollars to hang out with you…” Kris sighed.

“Farrow Woods is named after a teacher who used to run a one-room schoolhouse here! They say she went totally coo-coo bananas wacky and a bunch of schoolkids and her disappeared never to be heard from again!” Peggy got more and more amped as she talked through the tale.

Kris was fiddling with her smartphone absently, obviously not listening.

“KRIS! You’re not getting into it! It’s no fun if I’m the only one sleuthing for spirits! Don’t you remember what Nana Rickenbocker said when she gave us…” Peggy threw her backpack off her shoulders onto the leaf-strewn ground and began rummaging around in it, returning improbably, and very much like a cartoon character, with an old-timey gold candle holder with a single wide green candle sitting in it. “ the candle! She told us it was our job to help wayward spirits find their way to the great beyond and she even gave us our cool spirit helper name… The Candle Cousins!”

“Nana Rickenbocker was a drunk who died on the toilet trying to make a bathtub full of prison wine in her own house with a cigarette in her mouth…” Kris said, her voice tinged with disgust.

“ Don’t say stuff like that, Kris! That’s not very nice and also not true!” Peggy said in return.

“Uncle Dave said it at her funeral. I'm pretty sure that was way less nice…Anyway, she’s dead and when you die you just lay in the dirt forever anyway. It’s way cooler than stupid fucking life.” Kris pressed hard on her smartphone screen a few times and then huffed, dejectedly. “I don’t have any service out here. This officially blows chunks out my gunt. I’m goin’ home.”

“You can’t go home! We haven’t even lit the candle yet..!” Peggy pleaded, rustling around in her backpack for another moment before returning with a disposable bic lighter. She flicked it about a billion times, Kris’ eyes rolling every time like a pavlovian dog after a click, before the wick of the candle finally caught fire.

“Look I don’t give a shit either way about–”

“ She’s almost here…”

The instant the candle burned to life in its sickly iridescent green, an echoing voice broke through their argument and seemed to fill the entire space around them within the woods. Both girls twisted their heads around in the direction the voice was emanating, jaws dropped and eyes wide.

Standing in the clearing ahead of them was a small boy, no older than 10, dressed in off-white trousers, a wrinkled, red-stained dress shirt, suspenders, and a newsboy cap - his entire body giving off a steady, hazy glow in the remnants of light the setting sun still allowed them inside this dense tree-cover.

Peggy held out a hand, and was about to speak to the small boy, when Kris let out a blood-curdling scream at the top of her lungs and leapt backward away from them.

“HOLY SHIT! THAT’S A REAL GHOST! YOU HAVE TO BE FUCKING WITH ME!!” Kris screamed, her hands clasped over her mouth causing her voice to muffle.

“You have to hide… she’s almost here…” the little boy repeated, his body wavering like heat off of metal in the dead of summer but the shadows never leaving his eyes even for a moment.

“Who’s almost here…?” Peggy questioned, walking toward the small boy with her hand held out in a comforting gesture, trying her best to seem nonthreatening.

“ARE YOU TALKING TO IT?! WHAT THE FUCK? WHY? LETS GO!!” Kris kept screaming, trailing away from what was happening a step at a time.

“She’s almost here…” the little boy repeated, pointing his small finger further down the trail past him in the distance. “...you have to hide…”

Peggy peered down the pathway but couldn’t see anything past the blinding white of the boy’s ghastly form, wisps of smoke rising from his clothing as if he were dissipating on the wind.

“Who is she? What’s going to happen?” Peggy asked with more fervor, almost reaching the boy with her outstretched hand.

“She’s almost…” the boy began to repeat, but his eyes shot wide, the shadows fluttering away on the wind away from them to reveal the absolute terror etched into his young face. Slowly his head began to move down and left, sliding away from his neck, until it finally fell onto the ground with a sickening thud. It bounced only once with a cracking and liquidy sound before it, and the boy it once was attached to, were completely gone.

Peggy stepped back and held her hand to her chest, raising the smoking green candle into the air to turn it back and forth where the boy once stood. Nothing stood there now.

Not that any of this was a peaceful moment of relief as Kris was screaming over and over like a busted alarm clock going off incessantly in your dorm mate’s room that’s right Josh I remember all your stories about inane bullshit and love them.

“He’s gone!” Peggy screamed, turning the candlelight toward Kris. “You can stop screaming now…”

Kris did stop, and looked where the ghost boy had once stood, exhaling every bit of air out of her lungs and, like resetting her image, went immediately back to nonchalance. “Oh yeah, whatever. I commune with the dead all the time. Death is who I am, it’s whatever. My favorite band is The Used, this is nothing.”

Peggy, for her part, was completely ignoring the posturing and had dropped to the ground like a bloodhound and was rooting around in the dirt. Kris looked at her with that mixture of disgust and pity that everyone reserves for people who act cringe on the timeline - if that’s still a thing at this point, I guess we’ll see.

“LOOK! An old bronze key!” Peggy shot back up, covered in dirt and leaves, her hand clutched around an antique red-gold key with cracks and lines pock-marking its surface all over. She turned it over in her hands with a gigantic smile on her face - showing almost every brace within.

Kris snatched the candle away from her other hand, “You were holding this while rummaging through leaves?! What are you, a complete fucking MERVIN?!” she realized at that moment she had shown visible care about two things - the forest burning down, and the candle - and that was three things too many to be a true goth bitch like she wanted. “Uh.. not that I care. Fuckface.” Saved it.

“I think the ghost boy whose head fell off wanted us to go this way!” Peggy called out over her shoulder, charging headfirst down the forest trail ahead of them, leaves crunching loudly underneath her feet.

Kris watched her disappear into the dark and stood contemplating ditching her, going home, and watching the music video to “Helena” by My Chemical Romance for the 21st time today, but remembered it had taken them 45 minutes to walk this far… and she would have to do it alone. She followed after Peggy finally, walking at a clip that to an outside viewer would look like running, but she was way too dark and mysterious for that.

She walked at a normal uncaring clip until she was out of breath and had finally caught up to Peggy. She was standing, hands on her hips in triumph, in front of an old decaying building, red paint chipped off it to the point of unrecognition. But there was no doubt in either of their minds at this point… this was the one-room schoolhouse of Harrow Woods. Kris was suddenly wishing, silently and to herself of course, she had listened to the dweeb’s stupid story about what the fuck ever earlier.

“Take your stupid candle before I shove it up your bhole you skank.” Kris said, shoving the candle out of Peggy.

Peggy didn’t even turn around, fishing the key out of her overalls pockets and shoving it into the incredibly old bronze padlock that was attached to the desiccated old front door. The key turned, the padlock fell crashing to the floor, and a rush of cold wind pushed past the two of them and swung the door open wide before them. Kris threw her hand up in front of her eyes reflexively.

But inside was just a row of pews with small desktops lining them here and there with a long walkway in between leading up to a small podium that had been knocked over to its side. The inside looked more like an old burnt-down church than a school house that had been dilapidated by time.

“Look, maybe we should–” Kris began but stopped when she realized she was talking to no one. Peggy had already skipped merrily into the spooky ass old dump like she was tip-toeing through the tulips on a fresh spring day. Jesus christ what cringe, Kris thought deep in her jaded little head, but followed much more cool-ly and dark. Like the girl who dances on the coffin in the Deathring Seven video but even more gothic.

Peggy stooped over the fallen podium at the end of the walkway and looked around it’s base, seeing a bunch of sheets of yellowed, burned paper sticking out of the bottom of it. “Come and help me move this, please and thank you very much!”

“For fuck’s sake…” Kris muttered, sitting the candle holder down on top of one of the stray desk tops that still dotted the room. The two of them lugged the heavy oaken podium back up to a standing position and wiggled it with some force off of the stack of old paper beneath.

Peggy dove like a prized hunting dog on the papers and yanked them up. She scurried like a little field mouse trying to escape a predator across the schoolroom and to the candle, leaning in close to it to try to make out the words on the page.

Squinting to try to see better by the flickering light, she began to read out loud, “May 18th, 1944… Avery isn’t coming back from the war. The man from the Army board came and told me today. We were supposed to have a big banquet for him tonight, but now… I can’t keep the school open without Avery… the children have no future… the world is dead..”

Kris interrupted, “Hey this is pretty cool actually, let me read it.” and snatched the paper from Peggy’s hands, turning it over toward the light and continuing to read it herself, “ I’ll set them free… the children will go to heaven… I’ll go to hell… but it’s better than suffering to death.. Signed Emily Harrow… holy shit, THAT’S why it’s called Harrow Woods! I fuckin’ solved it, bitch.”

“I TOLD you this already! You never listen to me anymore!” Peggy protested, her fists balled up at her sides.

“You told me like, a quarter a story, that’s fully heinous of you actually.”

“I tried to tell you but you stopped me before I could!”

“She’s almost here…”

The voice stopped their argument once again, both of them turning to face the same small boy in his same newsboy hat and 40’s attire, staring at them unblinkingly from in front of the podium. He pointed up toward the stairs at the back of the building that lead to the bell tower at the top, dilapidated and broken down as they are now.

“You have to hide…”

Kris was about to scream again when Peggy clapped her hand over her mouth, holding hard to keep her from it. She held her hand out toward the young boy again, and spoke in her soothingest, least spittle-throwing tone, “Who is coming…? Mrs. Harrow? Did she do… that to you?”

The little boy simply nodded, and pointed to the stairs behind the podium once again.

“Hide there…?” Kris asked, prying Peggy’s hand off of her face. “I don’t take advice on life and death situations from people who already failed that test, ghost kid, sorry.”

“Stop being rude! He didn’t choose to die, a crazy old murder-teacher killed him! Right, little boy?” Peggy yelled, but when she turned her eyes to look back at the little boy, his head was flying through the air, directly at the two girls across the pulpit.

They screamed, and dove on the ground, the head splatting heavily and wetly against the jagged old floorboards beneath them. It rolled slowly across the floor in front of them, both of them laying with their stomachs and hands against the floor. They followed the head rolling until it finally stopped, a hand reaching down to grasp it with fingers that had far too many joints, encircling it like snakes and lifting it into the air. Standing at the entrance to the schoolroom was a woman with her skin dangling off of half of her body, burned away from the bone and singed into a molten gray free-hanging mess. Her empty eye sockets slowly dripped thick, black, old blood like a maple tap, which plitted and puddered against the floorboards with each drop.

“The children will go to heaven… after the feast…” the grotesque figure whispered, her voice like sputtering coals in a fire.

Both Peggy and Kris screamed as hard as they possibly could, the sound of their ear-piercing shrieks filling the room to the brim. The grotesque figure placed her elongated fingers over her ears and stepped away from them, giving them the perfect opportunity to run… except the figure was standing directly in front of the only entrance or exit to the school.

So they turned on their heels and ran, straight up the jagged and broken steps toward the bell tower, exactly where the now-headless boy had pointed them toward before. Even in the rush up the steps, Peggy couldn’t help but notice the young boy’s body was gone now.

There were only a dozen steps up before they reached the crows nest where the bell was wrung, the two of them pressing their bodies into the wall as tightly as they could compact to keep away from the opening back down the stairs. They both breathed heavier and deeper than they could remember, both assured that thing was going to pop out of the opening at any moment to take their heads as well

But it didn’t. A few minutes passed. Still nothing. And a few more. The two of them looked at one another, and Peggy moved away from the wall, Kris trying desperately to grab onto her and make her stop but to no avail.

Peggy peered over the edge down the stairs, and tilted her head a little to try listening. There was an odd sound from down there… metallic and familiar.. It took her a moment to realize it was the clinking of cups and silverware. “The banquet..!” she whispered, looking back at Kris.

“You have to be fucking with my fartbox, Peggy, we can’t go back down there! That thing is gonna behead us like that fucked up little street urchin boy!” Kris pushed herself tighter against the wall.

“The candle is still down there..!” Peggy said, slowly lowering herself down the stairs a step at a time, trying not to press her whole weight down at any moment. “You can stay here..” she whispered back up.

But Kris was already behind her, following in the same footsteps. Peggy smiled. Kris grimaced at her. “Fuck you very much.” she mouthed almost soundlessly.

As they moved down, Peggy caught the glimpse out of the corner of her eye of what was stashed up in that bell tower this entire time… old fashioned gasoline cans… dozens of them lining one side of it.

When they could see back into the schoolhouse the entire inside was completely different than they had seen before. Instead of rows of old dilapidated pews and desktops there was a single long decorated table down the center of the room. Seated along the table on both sides were boys and girls all dressed in their white finest, all cheerfully eating at the table. All except for the boy they had seen before, he was nowhere to be seen. The door at the other end of the room was shut tightly, and the desiccated corpse of Mrs. Harrow stood in front of it.

The two young girls suddenly understood what the liquid leaking out of the grotesque teacher’s eye sockets was… she was crying to herself, a gigantic smile split across her madened features. She waved a gigantic long hand over the room, and gave an uproarious laugh. The children continued to eat, each one glowing a slight incandescent blue.. You know… like Casper in the movies. Exactly the same actually, they’re also dead kids.

Peggy and Kris were frozen, watching as Mrs. Harrow walked across the room toward them, her unseeing eye holes pointed directly at them. There was nowhere to go.. There was no way she didn’t see them!

They dove, head first, off of the steps, to the side, landing with a heavy, echoing thud against the floorboards which were, for some reason, no longer jagged beneath them. Thankfully. They slid against the smooth surface of the boards and turned back, expecting the apparition to be upon them, to take their lives in one fell swoop of its horrid lashing fingers. But she wasn’t there.

Mrs. Harrow continued up the stairs past where they had been, laughing and sobbing quietly to herself, her voice echoing like an old radio recording off of nothing.

Just then the children all began to scream at the top of their lungs. Peggy and Kris whipped their heads around to see the ghostly children running away from the table toward the doors at the front of the schoolhouse, all but one, who was frozen in unfathomable terror. The one child left was leaned across the table, holding the silver cloche that had been hiding the dish at the center of the table this whole time.

Sitting upon a silver platter, still dripping warm blood onto the surface beneath, was the head of the little boy who had guided them there, his newsboy cap still resting upon his lifeless head.

The ghostly children pressed against the front doors with all their wait, yanking at the handles and screaming a cacophonous scream, but they did not budge. They ran this way and that, to the windows, but not one of them would budge, the children’s slamming against them far too weak to break them. They were feverishly trying to escape… an escape they had attempted a million times before.

Down the stairs the schoolmarm came, two gas cans dangling from her monstrously twisted hands, gas running down them and off onto the floor in sploshing puddles. She continued to laugh and sob intermittently as she went, throwing the gas cans forward and back to send the liquid within, raining down the banquet table, on the tables and chairs, all over the children as they screamed and ran.

“The children will go to heaven… even if I go to hell…” she repeated to herself in her tinny distant voice.

Kris screamed as well, grasping onto Peggy and shaking her as they both scrambled to their feet. “ We have to get out of here!! We’re going to die too!”

Peggy looked around, there wasn’t any way out of this place… except.. She turned her eyes back up the stairs where Mrs. Harrow had disappeared to, where they had hidden before, and yanked Kris hard along with her as she ascended the stairs again. Kris didn’t have time to argue, let alone the right mindspace.

The two of them got the top quickly, and Peggy yanked down the long old rope that had once kept the bell aloft and been used to ring it. One end of it was still attached, she hoped well enough, to the apex of the bell tower, the other was now loose thanks to her. It only had to get them far enough down to not hurt when they fell.

She threw the free end of the rope off the side of the schoolhouse as flames began to erupt up the stairs behind them. Kris screamed, but Peggy pushed her hard toward the rope, shoving it into her hands. “CLIMB DOWN!”

Kris didn’t have the clear level of thought needed to realize how stupid this was, and grasped onto the rope, swung her legs over the side, and began to shimmy down it. Peggy followed suit when there was enough room, the ancient rope whining and creaking louder than the spreading flames against the weight of them.

They swung unbidden, back and forth in the air, fire creeping up the outside of the building on either side of them as they descended. Peggy wasn’t having much trouble with the rope, as she had always prided herself on keeping a godly mind, and a godly body - she held the school record for sit-ups AND the sunday school record for prayer-ups, whatever the fuck that was. But Kris was floundering, eventually starting to lose her grip.

“Peggy..!!” she screamed, sliding a small way down the rope, which burned into her hands and caused her to yelp in pain.

“You’re low enough to drop now, Kris!” Peggy called down to her in return.

Kris shut her eyes tightly, and let go. She felt the cold, hard ground slam against her back and rolled to the side immediately, the air knocked out of her lungs.

The moment Kris released the rope, Peggy was yanked partially the way back up, the rope being pulled at the other end harshly. She looked back up to the top and saw two empty eye sockets staring back down at her, the long, spindly, burning arms of Mrs. Harrow, now almost completely engulfed in flames, were reaching down at her, drawing her ever close.

Peggy screamed and let go of the rope, falling far higher than she had ever planned to… directly into the awaiting arms of Kris below. The two of them tumbled over each other into the leaves and grass below, rolling for a moment before coming to a complete stop.

Mrs. Harrow screeched into the dark night after them, her eyes filling up with the flames that enwreathed her now.

“Th…The doors…!” Peggy shouted through the pain in her chest, stumbling to her feet and running around the burning schoolhouse with an unsteady gait. Kris lurched to her feet and gave chase, understanding for the first time since they had reunited after summer break exactly what Peggy was doing and what she needed.

The two ran to the front of the building and found the two double doors to the entrance barred with a gigantic piece of timber, crossing from one side of it to the next. Peggy began to push it up with every bit of strength in her but could hardly budge it. Thankfully Kris had run around to join her by this point, and pressed her strength into it as well, throwing the bar off and to the side of the doors.

Both girls grabbed a door and wrenched it open, revealing… a broken, empty old schoolhouse inside. An empty, busted walkway with pews lining both sides, old dilapidated desktops here and there.

“But…. what…?” Peggy stuttered, looking back at Kris, who through huffs and puffs from all the physical strain, could only return her shocked, confused look.

“ Thank you… “ a familiar echoing voice broke the silence. Standing behind them in the forest clearing was the little ghostly boy in a newsboy cap again. He had a smile upon his face, and a warmth to his eyes that was missing before. “You freed us from the fire… we no longer live here… we can move on now…”

The boy walked toward them slowly, and held out his hand to them. Within it was an antique golden candle holder, and a burning green candle within it. Kris lurched away from him, pulling her hands to her chest. Peggy took the candle and smiled at him as he turned and faded into the night. The candle’s flame snuffed itself out a moment after.

“We did it!” Peggy yelled, jumping up and down in place like a pogo stick, thrusting her fist in the air.

“Yeah… whatever.” Kris said, tossing her hair over one eye. But slowly a slight smile spread across her face.

“Candle Cousins?” Peggy said, holding her hand out.

“Sure…Candle Cousins.” Kris said, taking her hand in a firm handshake.

The two girls returned home, finding it was only 8pm. Day ends at like 2 fucking pm during this time of the year so I guess it shouldn’t be a surprise but holy shit. Kris made Peggy listen to Saves the Day. Peggy pretended to like it but didn’t understand at all. Peggy made Kris listen to Our God is an Awesome God. Kris hated it and was extremely up-front about that.

The End.
