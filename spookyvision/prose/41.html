The Candle Cousins in “The 13 Ghosts of (Scooby Doo) Redmane Manner”

By Jeff Pennington

Prompts: Laboratories & Cucumbers


The Redmane Manner had been tucked between two high rise buildings in Lower Manhattan for going on 100 years at this point, it’s strange, esoteric gothic architecture beckoning for the twisted and mentally disturbed while terrifying the dementia ridden elderly and the local Home Owner’s Association, which are, as we all know, the exact same thing.


It was said that in the not-too-distant past the manor had played host to witches, demented secret societies, and occult rituals the likes of which mere mortals could never comprehend without going mad at the mere thought. Nowadays it costs $22.95 plus tax for the walking tour and they sell little witch riding a broomstick bobblehead figures in the gift shop for fifteen bucks a pop.


The walking tour was slated to last about two hours from basement to rooftop and back but Peggy Rickenbocker and Kristiana Blackheart Malaria Bloodwraith, a duo of amateur paranormal sleuths collectively known as The Candle Cousins, were on the third hour straight of their droning teenage guide trying to both get through his dry ass boring script describing the manor’s beautiful brass door handles AND try not to kill himself. So tensions had finally risen too high to ignore.


“THIS BLOWS MY HAIRY BLOATED DICK!” Kris finally screamed out, causing the septuagenarian walking tour to all turn and gasp in horror and disgust at the foul mouthed outburst from a teenage girl.


“O-oh my, she didn’t mean to take the whale’s name in vain! She’s… uhm… she’s sorry!” Peggy leapt to clap her hand over Kris’ mouth and began to try to drag her away from the assembled group of gawking, angry boomers locked and loaded to leave a Yelp review HEAVILY citing this moment as the downfall of American society. Or maybe Yelp wasn’t a thing yet and they’d leave a review on Friendster or something? I don’t remember.


The two of them stepped over to a dimly lit corner of the third floor of the manor, underneath a gigantic portrait of some nasty old geezer that looked like he was the product of several thousand years of inbreeding and bad dentistry. I’m not going to make the joke but you know where this dude was from.


“WHAT are you DOING?!” Peggy hissed out moistly from her gritted braced up teeth, her hand recoiling from Kris’ mouth and her lip upcurling into a straight up babyfaced pout. The strongest of what she called her ‘dark emotions.’


Kris immediately turned back to the tour group as they shuffled away down the hall to gawk in merriment and shock at some old shitty chandelier that cost her dad’s entire years salary and would make Liberace blush at its bedazzled excess. “I MEANT IT YOU OLD DUSTY SEXLESS GEEZERS! JUST DIE ALREADY!”


Peggy just continued to stare, stone-faced.


“What? They should totally die soon, it would be good for everybody.” Kris responded nonchalantly. “I know you were getting sick of this dumb tour too, Peggy. We came here to see if there were any real ghosts in this ten cent tourist trap and we’ve been walking around talking about furniture with a dude who has never even seen an unscambled boob before. It’s hardcore lame.”


Peggy sighed, shoving her hands into the pockets of her flower-print overalls and looking around idly. “You’re right… the candle hasn’t so much as even flickered since we showed up. I was so sure there were gonna be tons of ghosts we could help find their peace here, just like Grandma wanted us to…before she passed away…”


“You always make it sound so weak! Grandma died on a stolen motorcycle popping a full wheelie down main street during Mardi Gras to escape police custody! She was such a bad ass, I definitely take after her.” Kris said with a practiced, fake smirk, recounting the official death of their Grandma in case I ever wrote that she died a different way before. Put that shit on the Wiki and then I’ll keep it canon, fuckers.


“She died in her sleep surrounded by her family and friends of old age disease!” Peggy shot back, scandalized at her cousin’s blatant lie. “You and I weren’t there because we both had pink eye and they didn’t want grandma to catch it!”


“She was DYING, you dumb baby! Why would they care if she caught pink eye or not?!” Kris fired back in return, shaking her head to swivel her dangling dyed black bangs out of the way.


“S-she didn’t wanna give Jesus pink eye in heaven!” Peggy stuttered out.


“Holy CRAP, you cannot be–” Kris managed to start before a set of hands clasped each of the cousins on the shoulder and silenced them immediately.


They turned their gaze up toward their new captor together, seeing a tall thin gentleman with a pencil thin mustache and hair so violently waxed backward on his skull that it almost looked painted on staring back down at them through his nose.


“The ladies would be best to quiet their quarrel and return to the walking tour. There can be no stragglers here.” The dapper gentleman honked through his nasal passages at them. “I would escort you back to your peers myself but…”


The man drew his hands away from them and dipped into his coat pocket, returning with a small, clear bottle of hand sanitizer. This dude just globbed an entire Flubbers worth of this shit right into his palms and started working it around his whole hands. When he stopped it was like he’d basically made a liquid set of gloves for himself but he seemed satisfied with it anyway? He snorted out his last sentence, “I would not wish to become infected with whatever poor person stink disease the two of you carriers have brought into my home. Please see yourselves ahead.”


And with that, he turned and marched away, nose in the air.


“Who the fuck was that and why didn’t I zing him with a violently dark comeback like I always do…?” Kris said with a distant disbelief in her voice.


“And what could he have possibly even added to this story? Like, why would the author write him in just to have him leave without even saying his name or explaining himself at all?” Peggy responded, shaking her head. “It’s like this guy writes these stories the night before the show or something.”


“...wait, what?” Kris turned to face Peggy, confusion writ across her pancake make-uped face.


“I said we should just go home, I can’t stand another hour of This Old, Old, Old House with Backne Ben, Teenage Tour Guide.” Peggy said sadly.


Kris chuckled, “Wow, I’m really rubbing off on you, you’re almost cool now.”


“I AM?! WOW! WE’RE LIKE TWINS AGAIN!” Peggy latched onto Kris with both arms, hugging her tightly and squeeing right in her godamn ear like a con girl meeting a Z-grade actor from a show called something like “Gorgon 13” or whatever. You know how they be. “Maybe you can let me tell people at school we’re related now!”


“Ugh don’t touch me, you feeb!” Kris jerked away, brushing herself off like a Slimer had just touched her. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. First you can earn letting the lunch ladies know we’re related, then janitorial staff, then teachers, and then maybe, MAYBE bus drivers if you stop wearing unicorns on everything.”


“Not unless I’m at gunpoint.” Peggy replied.


The two girls walked to the stairs they had just come up and began to descend, giving up their goal of ghost rejuvenation and turning their sights towards loftier, more important life goals.


“Let’s go back to my stupid ex-parents Ron and Cheryl’s place and play Devil May Cry 2. GAHD that Dante is so hot I’d let him do anything. Even kiss with tongue.” Kris said, swooning after early 2000’s pixelated heart throb and demon slayer Dante from the Devil May Cry Series, check those games out at your local Blockbuster.


“GROSS!” Peggy said jovially, shoving Kris a little. “Isn’t that game demonic, though? My parents said if you play a demonic video game then you see Mario with hyper-realistic blood on your TV and then you kill yourself for some reason!”


“Mario’s a Nintendo game, dumbass. This is Playstation.” Kris retorted.


“Oh, ok!” Peggy said sunnily. “Is it a cooperative game? I don’t like to play those violent versus games like Garfield Kart.”


“Wait.. do you hear something?” Kris stopped on her step, peering down into the dark space between hanging lights below them. A shadow seemed to move and flicker amongst them and Kris had to squint to even make out the movement. “What is THAT shit? Fucking spooky.”


The two girls watched as the shadows below them slowly coalesced. This not being their first fucked up spooky ass rodeo they both took a step back up the stairs and readied themselves to run at a moments notice.


But the tell-tale sound of burning made it quite obvious what was about to happen. Peggy quickly slung the backpack she always wore off her shoulder and yanked out the green candle on its golden holder stand, the strange flickering emerald flame at the top of it steadily burning, and even leaning toward the shadows below.


“I KNEW there had to be spirits here in need of our help!” Peggy cried out happily.


“Shut your steel trap, we don’t know if this one’s gonna try to dismember us first or not yet…! Get a clue, numbnuts!” Kris whisper-yelled from between her teeth.


From within the swirling, inky-black torrent of nothingess deep within the shadows came the unknowable horror from within - a small, glowing white kitty cat with even brighter white glowing eyes, which stretched and yawned a huge yawn before sitting in the middle of the landing and staring at the two girls, head tilted to the side.


“Aww, it’s a little ghost kitty!” Peggy chirped with excitement.


“Damn, that’s actually pretty sad when you think about it. Fucking sick.” Kris whispered, mostly to herself.


“Whaddya mean? Why’s it sad?” Peggy looked over at Kris, completely unaware.


“Um.. nevermind. “ Kris pointed back at the cat. “Should we like… pet it or pick it up or..?”


The luminescent feline stood and turned in a small circle on the landing below them, then looked down the stairs for a moment, then back up at the cousins, blinking it’s large white light bulb eyes slowly.


“Oh! She wants us to follow her!” Kris said, a little to excitedly. Then backtracked, returning to her true goth self. “...or whatever, why would I care?”


“That’s great! Maybe she can show us how to help her to the other side!” Peggy hopped down the steps, causing the spectral cat to begin bounding down the steps ahead of them. “That’s a polite way of saying Heaven to disgusting heathens!”


Kris took off afterwards, having trouble keeping up due to the massive clod-hopper pleather boots she was wearing straight from the mid-section of Spencer’s Gifts, right before it gets a little too PG-13 even for her back in the back.


They rounded two sets of stairs, passing the second floor entirely, on their wild ghost chase, the cat easily staying ahead of them as it leapt from one step to the other with the grace only being a cat can afford you. Or like Peter Pan or something. Analogies are tough.


Finally, at the bottom staircase of the building, the cat took a sudden, sharp, bounding leap straight at the wall before the last turn, passing through it effortlessly and disappearing beyond it’s bounds.


This didn’t turn out so fortunate, or so graceful, for Peggy and Kris. Peggy couldn’t stop herself, and went flying from the top step straight into the wall, the old molded structure beginning to buckle inwards from her body bashing into it, but her 98 pounds soaking wet wasn’t gonna be enough, even after a hundred years of decay.


Unfortunately, Kris’ added weight was exactly enough, as she couldn’t stop herself either. The completely tractionless pleather soles of her boots squeaking loud as any Spongebob walk cycle as she lost her footing on the same top stair and came tumbling head first into her cousin, and the wall she rested halfway in. The plaster and wood splintered into confetti as the two of them crashed down through it and into the darkness beyond it, rolling down some kind of metallic chute they couldn’t make out but could definitely feel. 


The two of them bashed off the sides of the metal chute violently until they were fired out of it like a cannon into a darkened room somewhere deep below where they had started out. The dust slowly settled around them, and the silence between them lasted much longer than either would have liked it too but both of them were too busy checking to see if they were dead, or at the very least if anything was broken.


“K-Kris…?” Peggy finally managed to whimper out, sitting up and crossing her legs under her. “Are… are you ok?”


“Fuck my shit….” Kris groaned out, sitting up and swiping plaster and wood bits out of her fringe hastily. “I think I ate every spider on the way down here…”


“You should like that, right? That’s what evil people like, I think.” Peggy smiled weakly. “You love evil!”


“Shut the hell up, damn.” was all Kris said in return.


A small meow caught both of their attention. In the middle of the dark room, only illuminated by the full moon outside the high basement windows and it’s own bright light, was the ghost cat from before, licking its paw between taking glances at them.


Kris stood up, wobbly for a moment but gaining her footing quickly, and began to tip-toe toward the spectral cat. For its part the cat just watched her, tilting its head every now and then at her approach.


“Psss pss psss… good kitty. I’m your friend. I fell through multiple stories of walls and floors to come see you, the least you could do is be my friend too.” Kris whispered out in her most cat-pleasing tone.


And to Peggy’s absolute shock, and maybe even a little bit of surprise on Kris’ part too, the cat actually allowed her to touch it. Her hand sunk into the ghostly creature for but a moment before she drew it back up to skin level and it stayed there. The ghostly cat rubbed her head into Kris’ hand for a moment before purring a soft, simple melody in return for the skritch. 


“I… I didn’t know you were so good with cats…!” Peggy said, astonished. “Well, I guess they are Satan’s tool to trick humanity into sin, so that makes sense, but this one seems nice!”


“I like cats, so sue me.” Kris said, barely paying attention to her cousin as she continued to pet the cat. 


But the cat had other plans to continue and pulled away suddenly, hopping off the table and doing a figure 8 through Kris’ legs, rubbing against the sides of her boots as it did. The cat took one last look up at Kris, then back at Peggy, meowed one last little meow, and slowly began to walk across the room toward the other end, which was completely shrouded in darkness. By the time the cat had made it there, it too had disappeared completely into the shadows there.


“It’s gone!” Peggy called out. Kris sighed, shaking her head at the obviousness of this broad. “We gotta find away to follow it!”


“No fucking doy.” Kris spit out, rooting around in her tiny little pants pockets that all womens clothing have for some reason, and returning with a lighter. She snapped it a few times, trying to get it to light the room.


Peggy reached back into her backpack and produced the green candle once more, it’s flickering bright emerald light illuminating the room pretty brightly around them for being such a small flame. She walked up beside Kris and handed her the candle, a smirk across her freckled face. “No freaking doy, huh?”


Kris snatched the candle and grimaced at her cousin in the light. But she still lifted it high into the air to search around this end of the room for a light switch. Eventually she found an extremely old-timey button push switch and pressed it in - the switch’s rust causing it to take quite a bit of force to compress.


Gas lights suddenly clicked on around the top of each wall, brightly illuminating the space the two of them had been fumbling around in this entire time. The room wasn’t just some bottom of the building hole for idiots to fall into - no, it was something else entirely, straight out of a Hammer Horror picture. The walls were lined with strange glass tubing, twitching and rising high into the air, strange stagnant liquid pooling in their bottoms. Mechanical machinery with hundreds of switches filled every corner, and longer, marble slabs of operating tables lined the middle of the room. This was some kind of mad scientists laboratory they had stumbled into! Uh-oh!


“This is some kind of mad scientists laboratory we’ve stumbled into!” Peggy screamed out. “Uh-oh!”


“Shut up!” Kris yelled back, startling Peggy back to normal. Or as close to normal as a girl raised by nutjob evangelical parents could ever be. She paused, looking around the room. “This place rules actually.”


Also there was like an old nasty cucumber in a bottle of vinegar on the table in the middle of the room for some reason? Pretty fucked up they just shoved that shit into the story so painfully badly I mean just left that there on the table for decades or more who knows, anyway.


The two of them did notice where the spectral cat had disappeared to at the end of the room at this point, though. There was a mass of rubble and a caved in side wall at the other end of the laboratory, with a gigantic pile of stone and wood reaching from the floor to the ceiling like the middle column had just given out on that wall.


“It must’ve gone through there…” Peggy said sadly. “I don’t think we’re gonna be able to pratfall through this one comedically.”


“No, no, no… look!” Kris ran across the room and hunkered down the bottom of the crashed pile, pointing out an archway had stayed in tact, even sunken into the floor below, and there was plenty of space there for two small teens to crawl through! TEEN POWER!™


“Maybe there’ll be more spiders for you to eat!” Peggy said happily, kneeling down to crawl through the hole. Kris glowered in return.


The two of them slowly crawled into the darkness ahead of them, Peggy holding the candle out in front of her to illuminate the way. It felt like a long crawl, and the width and height of the tunnel began to squeeze in on them as they went. Kris would never say this out loud, but as the fear of the enclosed tunnel crushing them washed over her and almost made her knees buckle out from under her, she really admired Peggy’s unshaken bravery in that moment.


Peggy was mostly thinking about how this was a lot like how she remembered being born. Therapy bills were gonna be CRAZY for this chick down the road.


Still, they managed to crawl from the other end of the tunnel, and the flickering light of their candle suddenly seemed pretty superfluous.


The room was small, and a lot of it was made up of fallen rubble at this point, three out of four walls having buckled inward due to the outside pressures of the earth around it, but some of it was still in tact, including several tables, a few large shelving units scattered here and there with cans, and a small seat in the corner. But sitting on top of every surface - table, chair, shelf, stone pile, you name it, was a small, glowing white cat with it’s brightly lit white eyes staring down at them. Thirteen small bright white specters watched their every move carefully as the two girls slowly raised back up to their feet.


“Suddenly it’s not so cute…” Kris muttered, dusting herself off. “And way, way more sad.”


“Wow, there’s so many of them! Wait… what’s so sad about this, darnit?” Peggy demanded.


Kris was thankful when the cats started meowing one after another, a slow chorus of singing in the round the same tune from each of them. They all had an urgency to their voices that sent a shiver down the girls’ spines, the two of them frantically looking around the room at all of them.


“Wait, there!” Peggy pointed down to the ground. Directly in front of them, in the middle of the room crushed under the weight of one of the collapsing walls, was a human skeleton, its long, thin, desiccated arm reaching out across the floor from its final resting place.


The two girls’ eyes followed the outstretched, reaching arm towards its unfulfilled destination. Just out of the bleached white fingers’ reach was a small, flat, round tin with an extremely faded label on it which read “Fableman’s Tuna, it’s the Fishiest Feast in the Seven Seas!” with a small, winking cartoon tuna-fish wearing a bowler derby and smoking a cigar barely visible beyond it.


The cats all began to yowl and yell, leaping down off of their perches and beginning to circle the room randomly, rubbing up against one another, passing through one another, you name it.


“They’re…. They’re just hungry…?” Kris muttered under the cacophony of reverberating, hollow cat voices that filled the room to it’s brim. “That’s it? That’s the ENTIRE mystery?! What the fuck?”


The cats yowled twice as loud at the mention of word ‘hungry’, apparently having a lot of experience with it.


Kris leaned down next to the tuna tin on the floor and scratched at the back of her head. “I don’t have a damn can opener! What the hell are we gonna do to shut this racket the hell up?”


Peggy dug around inside of her backpack and returned with a small, red swiss-army knife. She smiled as she flipped it open, revealing a can opening end with a small crank for turning the metallic saw wheel on its end. And that’s just what she did, stabbing it into the tin and turning it around and around, all the way around its lid.


“You’re pathological.” Kris muttered, shaking her head. “It’s painful being related to you.”


“Come and get it!” Peggy called out, as always completely oblivious to her cousin’s open contempt for everything she stood for. She withdrew the severed lid from the tin and tossed it aside.


The instant the lid hit the floor, all of the cats leapt into the air, spiraling around the room and creating a tornado of bright white swirling light. Peggy and Kris stood back to their feet and huddled closer together for what little protection they could provide each other.


“OOOOOOO YOU FUCKED UUUUUUPP!” Kris called out with glee.


“Nuh-uh! Nuh-uh!” Peggy yelled back over the loud crackling energy of the spiritual torrent in the room.


The swirling mass of light began to coalesce around the skeletal body beneath the rubble, and slowly, but surely, from within the bones came white light of it’s own. Swirling within the tunnel of light, until it reached its very apex until forming into a human figure at its core.


The cats began to appear from the end of the tunnel, running deeper into it to meet the human figure at its center, jumping up onto it’s shoulders and convening around it’s legs and rubbing against it happily.


The figure was suddenly noticeably female, and began to pet and press her barely visible face against their little faces in return. The woman in the light, blindingly bright and unseen within, turned to face the Candle Cousins, and smiled serenely. She lifted her hand up to reveal she was holding the tuna can within it now, and all of the cats meowed a bright, excited, purr-tinged meow as the light quickly faded into darkness again.


This left Peggy and Kris standing in near complete blackness, the flickering green of their candle dimming and then extinguishing itself with a small puff of smoke. Peggy flicked open her metal lighter and snapped it three times before it burned to life, barely illuminating the two girls enough to see each other.


“Wow… they wanted to be with that woman they loved in the afterlife… and we freed them from their prison here on Earth to do that!” Peggy said excitedly.


“Pretty sure they just wanted fed…” Kris retorted dryly.


“Oh, look at this!” Peggy called out, again oblivious to her cousins barbs. She leaned down next to the skeletal body on the floor and raised one of the large stones off of its body with some difficulty. Beneath where the stone had once laid it was obvious that the skeleton was wearing what remaining shreds were left of an old-timey maids uniform. “She must have been their caretaker as one of her duties!”


“That’s fucking nothing to me, how are we getting out of this dank ass pit? We fell down like twelve fucking floors or something.” Kris grumbled, already getting down onto the floor to crawl back through the hole in the rubble to the lab.


Eventually the two of them did in fact manage to find their way out though. Or they died down there. Who knows! I haven’t written it yet.


Anyway, buy more Candle Cousins merchandise and I guess we’ll see how it goes for them, if you catch my drift.


The End!
