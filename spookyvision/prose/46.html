There’s a Snake In My Boot

Prompts: Tournaments & Cheese

By Jeff Pennington


“Look dude can we like… just stop and talk for a second, or…?”


Ryo’s words fell on deaf ears, only the sound of the steady hard rain on the towers of junk and refuse that surrounded them answering his plea. Jason was too busy huffing and puffing painfully as he wrenched his body around to swing his ax through the air over and over - at this point so completely winded that he could barely lift the thing so it was mostly like hoisting it up and letting it fall in the general direction Ryo was standing in.


Ryo shifted his eyes to the side awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck as he stepped away from the oncoming strikes, such as they were, that Jason was swinging at him. “Look dude this is… this is getting kind of embarrassing now, can we please just sit down somewhere out of the rain and discuss this?”


“Fuck you, man!” Jason yelled out, finally planting the metal head of the axe into the muddy ground at his feet and leaning heavily with both hands on the butt of its handle to steady himself as he caught his breath. “Just give me like… three, four minutes, tops. Then I’ll… whoof… then I’ll kill you. Hold on.”


“I’m not standing here and letting you rest up to hit me with an ax, man, you can’t figure I’m gonna do that.” Ryo said with consternation in his voice. This dance back and forth had been going on between them for quite some time now, but every powerful swing of the ax that Jason let fly hit nothing but open air because of Ryo’s incredible speed and dextrous movements. He’d had a very long time to practice staying alive against an onslaught of horrors that Jason had barely scratched the surface of at this point so he mostly likely wasn’t ever gonna get hit at this rate. 


“You fucking killed me brother! Don’t fucking condescend to me, roach boy!” Jason spat out, leaning back and cracking his back and continuing to breath hard the chilled air of the rainstorm surrounding them.


“I’m pretty sure I didn’t.” Ryo returned. “Like.. almost positive. 70/30.”


“PRETTY SURE?!” Jason screamed out, hoisting his ax up and lunging at the object of his most intense hatred and rage. “I’M GONNA FUCKIN’ GUT YOU FOR THAT!” He swung the axe and its blade swiped close enough to Ryo’s face to cut a swift little mark in red across his cheek, causing him to recoil away from the stinging pain. 


“AH! Shit, dude!” Ryo spat out, hopping back out of the encroaching madman’s attack range. “I’m trying to keep my cool here man, cause if I transform neither of us is gonna like the outcome.”


“Oh yeah, transform then, you fucking bugfuck bitch! This ax is especially made to kill you disgusting freakshows! Burns you alive from the inside out.” Jason grinned widely, his eyes dilated like when you go to the optometrist but instead of eye drops that cause it it’s like murderous rage and shit. You wouldn’t imagine that's what they put in the eye drops but I guess it checks out. 


“Just tell me when your brother was killed you roid raging fuck!” Ryo screamed back at him, clearly at the end of his rope with this dude. There was something about Jason that reminded him of his pre-cricket abomination days - the guy he once was when Jeff didn’t know how to write him yet. Back when he went to Henderson University, which was a joke I totally forgot about until I checked my notes for this story. Pretty fucking funny, Past Jeff.


“God fucking damnit! He died three weeks ago now, and you know that as well as I do! Unless crickets can’t fucking tell time, I don’t know that shit!” Jason screamed back, spittle flying out of his mouth like a drill sergeant in a 90’s cartoon. 


“There, dumbass!” Ryo bellowed, pointing at Jason with a shaking finger. “I was in fucking Ohio three weeks ago! I didn’t get to Whitesville until the next week when we first met! Hell, I went to Kirby first even! Your brother was dead before I ever stepped foot into Connecticut again!”


“You lying sack of shit! I saw you on the tape in the Gestalt base we were held in! You were killing my brother in your stupid ass Power Rangers bug man villain form!” Jason gripped tighter onto the handle of his ax, holding it close to his chest and breathing heavily now not from fatigue but from white-hot rage.


“Oh yeah, it wouldn’t benefit Gestalt AT ALL to turn everyone against the guy who’s been singlehandedly destroying every Chrysalid they produce for the past year, huh?” Ryo shook his head in disgust. “Try thinking with your brain instead of your steroid syringe for five seconds and you’ll see that you’re getting played like a god damn fiddle!”


Jason suddenly felt a pang of acknowledgement in the pit of his stomach. He hadn’t even stopped to consider, even once, that his enemies might have lied to him to get him to give them the information they wanted. Which he was just-as-suddenly reminded was the whereabouts of Pavlov Flinch? What the fuck was up with that, anyway? Usually people want to sleep more soundly in their own homes and thus don’t want to know how close they may or may not be to such a man. But either way, he paused for a second, trying to wrap his brain around the ramifications of what he was just told.


But Jason being Jason he just screamed really loudly and started running at Ryo with his ax held up above his head instead.


“I’M GONNA FUCKING KILL YOU ANYWAAAYYYYY!!” 


“For fuck’s sakes…” Ryo muttered under his breath, hunkering at the ready for the onslaught.


But just before Jason could clear the distance, the massive pile of waste and parts that loomed above them in the storm exploded with the force of a mack truck slamming into it, sending shrapnel of metal, wood, and plastic flying in every direction with a deafening BANG!


Jason dove to the ground, rolling out of the way of the debris, but Ryo simply stood in place, watching with wide eyes in the pouring rain as all of the pieces of shrapnel landed harmlessly around him - as if he knew somehow none of them would come close to him.


In the mountain of trash’s place was the slowly uncoiling body of a gargantuan snake, its golden slitted eyes darting from one of them to the other as its fitting tongue hit rainwater and returned behind its cavernous hide lips. It lowered its head and glared directly at Ryo after a moment, opening its gigantic mouth wider than even imaginable and baring its prehensile fangs within - each one spouting poison into the open air in intimidation. 


From somewhere within it’s deep black maw a human voice, clear as day besides it’s deep reverberation, called out, “You two are startin’ to bore me somethin’ fierce… I was waiting for one of ya to gut the other so I could have a quick meal before killing whoever was left but you had to go and spoil that for me, Tachibana. Bad sportsmanship, in my opinion.”


“Snake, I thought I killed you twice already. You’re starting to really piss me off playing possum and running away like a bitch.” Ryo said plainly, turning away from Jason to stare down the behemoth reptile between them.


“Hey, don’t fucking talk about me like I’m not here!” Jason spat out, his pride hurting almost as much as his knees were from hitting the ground diving a moment before.


“Let's say we have ourselves a little tournament, Tachibana. Single elimination if you catch my drift. Whoever survives between the two of us gets to take on the reignin’ champ over here.” Snake twisted his gigantic serpentine body to motion towards Jason who was struggling to his feet in the heavy mud beneath them that had accumulated from the rainstorm.


“Hey FUCK YOU, yokel! I’ll kill you myself right the fuck now!” Jason screamed back in frustration, slinging mud off of his ax and holding it at the ready to his side, down low to the ground.


Ryo had lost sight of the conversation by now. He’d hunkered over forward and began to convulse in the rain, his body twisting a squelching with another living being just below the surface of the skin, bone, and muscle. Tendons ripped and bones snapped and flesh rended to make way for the horror inside of him until eventually it burst forth fully formed and twice his size - glistening in blood and viscera that clung tightly to its carapace even in the constant downpour. Where Ryo Tachibana once stood, a screeching, chittering insectoid horror now stood in his place. 


Snake lunged with all of his might toward the Cricketman, his elongated vice-like jaws opened wide and screeching themselves as he spiraled towards him like a bullet set loose from a rifle.


Until an ax came crashing down into the side of his gigantic body and stopped him in his tracks that is. Jason swung down with all of his might, having taken his opportunity to lunge as well, his glistening bright silver ax instantly finding purchase in the rippled scaly flesh of the once-human serpent


And then glancing off of it completely harmlessly. 


“WHAT?!” Jason screamed out in absolute shock, the strike against the hard scaled skin of the snake causing him to reverberate with the force of his own hit and fall back into the mud without the ax in his grip any longer. The haft of the weapon simply landed with a heavy thud in the mud off the side of him a yard or two, slowly sinking into the muck.


Snake barely even registered it had happened. Jason watched with disbelief on his face as the two anthropomorphic horrors slammed into each other with enough force to sending a small tsunami of rainwater deflecting off of them into the air around them. Their bodies intertwined and rolled off into a large pile of metal scrap, the tower of it collapsing in on top of them with an echoing crash which shattered windows around the junkyard.


As the two beasts raised back up out of the debris, Snake’s long swirling body coiled around Cricketman’s and raising him further up into the air to bite at him freely, the shock and disbelief in Jason suddenly soured. The bravado, the burning rage, the desire for revenge, the self-confidence in his own strength, everything that had been driving him to dive into situation after situation with reckless abandon melted away leaving only a shuddering, quaking fear in his blood that made him feel deeply sick to his stomach and began to drive him like the horseman’s whip to escape as fast as humanly possible.


He hadn’t felt fear like this in so long that the feeling was confusing at first - so foreign and estranged from him that he couldn’t process it at first. He wanted to run, he wanted to scream, he wanted to be anywhere else but here, but he sat in the mud and watched the titans as they rolled over one another, the gigantic Snake crashing into the ground across the junkyard and causing another tower of stacked car pieces to come crashing down on top of him.


He couldn’t help but remember standing at the batter’s mound in his ill-fitting little league uniform and trying his best to hold his bat like his father had taught him. His father sat in the bleachers on the other side of the fence next to all the other fathers, but he didn’t look like them. They wore looks of pride on their faces, bright smiles and friendly banter exchanged freely. Jason’s father looked disappointed. He always looked disappointed. He tried to swing for the ball, tried his hardest, but it had hit him square in the temple instead. He had felt fear swell up in his heart as the world had spun away into darkness around him - fear of failing his father yet again, yes, but in that moment, the last time in his life, a deep and instinctual fear of death.


He struggled to his feet in the mud once more, running as fast as he could in the slip and the sludge of it. He didn’t know where he was going, he could barely see through the sting of rain and the fear blinding him, but he knew he had to run. He had the presence of mind to stoop and pick up his ax, holding it against his chest as he charged around the corner of another trash pile and ducked as tightly as he could behind a concrete pillar and overhang which held a sign across it displaying what could be left at the dump and what had to be recycled here in processing at the front. He pressed his back into his pillar and his chest heaved, his eyes burned, and his muscles ached, but more than anything he felt an intense and unabiding disgust at the cowardice that had taken all fight from him.


—-------------------------------------------------------------


“Ok…here goes… I’m gonna lift this big heavy weight now and make my daddy love me. Here.. .here goes…” Dev said loudly, his eyes shifting around the room for any sign of Dips, the friendly skater dope ghost, who had promised to help him with this to begin with.


“...What the hell are you saying it like that for? Just lift the damn weight!” Devlin Jr., Dev’s dad grimaced and growled out, his hands hovering underneath the barbell he had weighed down to 200 pounds for his weakling ass kid.


“Yeah… here… here goes…” Dev said under his breath and then began to push up against the bar with his frail ass noodle arms which were only useful for typing code and Nickelodeon’s Doug cosplaying. To the immediate surprise of everyone living in the room the barbell lifted like it was absolutely nothing. Dev then allowed it to settle down to his chest and began to pump it up and down like I did to your mom’s gigantic sweaty ass last night behind the combination Taco Bell/ Pizza Hut near the mall. 


“Wh…What the hell?! You’ve been holdin’ out on me! You can lift?!” Devlin Jr. said with a wide grin on his chiseled old face, upturning his 70’s ass Carlos Santana mustache. “We gotta see just how strong you’ve got, hold on!”


While Devlin Jr. hurried over to the stacks of weight plates and began to stack them up to carry them back over to the bench, Dips’ radiant blue-white ghostly head popped out of the middle of the barbell directly over Dev’s face with a sudden “BOOYAH, LIL’ BRO!”  causing Dev to recoil with a loud, piercing scream.


“GUH?! What the fuck’s the problem now?!” Devlin Jr. turned around to grimace down at his son, not seeing the apparition that he did.


“N-nothin’ Dad… better make it a hum-dinger of a weight, huh?” Dev said with a cheesy fake smile. Devlin grumbled something about shoving dorks into lockers and getting cheerleader ass as he turned back around to continue tallying up weight plates.


“Dips!” Dev whispered as low as he could. “You’re a real lifesaver, if you’ll excuse the ironic expression! Why, if we keep this up, I might even win my father’s muscleheaded affections, loss of anger control through repeated CTE injury be damned!”


“Uh, I don’t think that’s really the healthiest connection, bro, but whatever floats your little dweeby boat, my man.” Dips said with a shrug of his non-corporeal shoulders in and out of the barbell he possessed.


“I didn’t know you could possess objects though!” Dev continued to whisper, “What other special abilities or supernatural powers do you have that you haven’t told us about yet?”


“No clue little dude,” Dips returned nonchalantly, “I’m gonna guess whateeeever the story happens to need me to be able to do.” He then turned to look directly at you, yes YOU listening to this right now, and gave you a gigantic cartoonish wink. His hand popped out of the barbell and gave you a big ol’ thumbs up to go along with it. A circular logo then iris’d in on top of him that said “DIPS WILL BE RIGHT BACK, AFTER THESE MESSAGES!” in big yellow letters around it.


—---------------------------------------------------------------

Jason had mostly caught his breath by now and had closed his eyes as he pressed tightly back against the concrete pillar. 


“What the fuck is up with this ax…? It just stopped working now…?” He stared shaking at the useless hunk of metal at the end of a stick he had thought would bring him revenge. He felt its empty weight in his hands and wallowed in his fear. 


He remembered the day he’d swore he’d never be afraid again. He and Archie were camping when a storm just like this one had kicked up that they hadn’t accounted for. The wind tore and the rain tore their tent to shreds and Archie was terrified that they were going to die in the middle of the woods alone. Truth be told, Jason felt that same fear grip at him and rend his mind from action. But when he saw the terror in his little brother’s eyes, he knew from that moment on that he had no other choice but to never be afraid again. For Archie.


He had led them out of the woods and back home. Seeing the relief on Archie’s face as they came up to the street they lived on and he began to recognize his was safe and sound had rewired Jasons’ brain forever. 


As the wind and the rain beat down on him now in his little hiding spot, he took a deep breath in, and let a deep breath out. The sound of metal rending and flesh tearing and monsters screeching echoed in the distance, but when he opened his eyes again, he felt the steel return to his blood.


“For Archie…” he whispered to himself. He looked around, peering from his hiding spot as far as he could see in one direction and the other. And then he finally saw exactly what he’d been looking for.


He ducked out of his hiding spot and ran low and fast against the ground across the causeway into the distance to his quarry. He climbed up the gigantic metal-treads on one side of the behemoth machine and stopped beside the small entrance door to its driver’s seat. Trying to door handle he found it locked and grimaced at the obviousness that that would be the case. But he did come to a decision pretty quickly about fixing that as well. He drew his axe back and slammed the blunt end of it into the reinforced glass of the door, cracking it inward a little. Another swing. Another swing. Another swing and as fatigue began to burn at his muscles the window fully gave way and popped out of its frame, clattering to the floorboards inside.


He climbed inside and began to power the massive machine on. He’d worked construction two summers during his graduating year of high school and during his freshman year so he knew everything he needed to know to do the one thing he wanted to do with this gigantic piece of heavy machinery - the excavator.


It powered to life loudly, but the sounds of carnage between the two gigantic beasts was loud enough that he knew neither of them would even notice. He threw the beast into gear after a few accidental mis-steps, and began to lumber its massive weight forward under the power of its unbelievably large, smog-blasting engines.


By this point it would have been absolutely impossible for the fighting Chrysalids not to notice the excavator lumbering towards them, CinamaSins told me so, so the two of them turned their wild bloodlusted beasts eyes towards the massive piece of heavy machinery and screeched out a horrifying sound incomprehensible to human ears.


“Jason, stop…!” Ryo’s voice echoed out of Cricketman’s open chittering maw, from deep within the same way that Snake’s had earlier, but Jason paid it absolutely no mind.


Snake tightened his grip around Cricketman’s body, squeezing the life out of him as he turned his gigantic open maw toward the excavator. He lunged wildly forward, his massive fangs bared, and bit down hard onto the roll cage of the machine, finding it just reinforced enough to catch his jaw and cause him to gag for a moment like your mom did last night when I gave her the full chalupa behind the combination Taco Bell/Pizza Hut except it wasn’t just for a moment because I don’t cum that fast, don’t ask your mom about it.


But that moment was all Jason needed. He threw the lever in front of him down as hard as he could, causing the gigantic heavy metal claw of the excavator to slam itself down, open and baring its serrated teeth, into Snake’s scaled long body, right where he had wrapped himself around Cricketman. The loud, deafening schlorp of the excavators claw driving itself into the horrendous beasts flesh and then forcing itself all the way through the ground below it was almost loud enough to be heard over the howling screaming screech that Snake let out as his body was split in half by the force.


Jason snapped shut the claw, enveloping both Snake’s torso segment, bleeding in waves of disgusting viscous purple blood, and the trapped body of Cricketman inside of it, and then locked the mechanism inside in place so that it would provide the perfect inescapable prison.


Snake for his part was still screeching bloody murder, bashing and smashing what was left of his long scaled body wildly in every direction, knocking over piles of debris and smashing into mountains of trash, before finally slowing down, sloughing off the metal roll cage of the excavator it had been holding onto this entire time, and crashing down to the ground with a reverberating slam. 


Then, finally, as the rain slowly began to die down, all was still in the morning the air for just a moment.


Jason slumped back into the uncomfortable old leather seat of the heavy machine, throwing an arm over his forehead and resting against the back of the headrest. “Fucking…. Fuuuck…” he muttered to himself.


But the silence was soon broken by the telltale sound of police sirens in the distance.


Jason grimaced, sitting up again. “Yeah, yeah… of fucking course…”


The roll cage had been warped enough by the force of Snake’s bite that it was easy enough to crawl out of now, but the climb back down to the ground didn’t prove as simple. Still, Jason escaped the carnage he had created, and started the long, limping jog back to Dev’s house.


—------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“800 POUNDS?!” Devlin Jr. cried out in disbelief, his hands slapping the sides of his face and elongating his shocked grimace as he wiped them down his cheeks. “That’s not humanly possible, god damnit! What kinda super freak ARE you? You coulda been the entire Buffalo Bills by now! Why didn’t you TELL me?!”


“Well pops… ya didn’t ask!” Dev grinned from ear to ear, his wobbly little stick arms pumping the barbell up and down like it weighed absolutely nothing - mostly because to him, it did.


“I’m flabbergasted… I’m bamboozled…! I’m… genuinely pretty freaked out!” Devlin Jr. sputtered.


“Oh that’s nothin’ dear ol’ dad of mine! Check THIS little trick out I learned from watching the non-disgusting parts of Pumping Iron with Arnold Scwarzenegger! You know the parts where he’s not oggling titties or talking about cumming!” Dev called out, taking one hand off the barbell and reaching over to the small snack table next to the weight lifting stand.


He calmly took out a cracker from the sleeve, spread a little bit of mustard on it, and then placed a piece of cheese and a slice of salami on it and then reached back and slipped it into his mouth nonchalantly. “Mmmmm, delicious! But not because it has cheese, I don’t have any special relationship with cheese because I’m an original character and not any other pre-existing IP about a young black supernerd!”


Devlin Jr. swooned a little, his head light, and leaned down to place his hands on top of the barbell that Dev was holding up so lightly. “Ok, gimme that damn thing! I know you gotta be pullin’ one of your basement virgin tricks on me, like when you tried to tell me the vaccine didn’t make you into a human magnet!”


But when Devlin Jr. yanked the barbell from Dev, he stumbled back a step. He caught himself just in time for the barbell’s weight to suddenly dawn on him - and he instantly rolled backward, the bar slamming into his forehead and his back slamming into the ground afterward knocking him out fuckin’ COLD. Cold as yo momma’s FRONT BUTT when she thinks about your real dad - who by the way isn’t the guy you think it is. It’s a dude named Frank from Sacramento. Don’t look him up, he’s not gonna love you any more than the guy pretending to be your dad will.


“HOLY CRAP!!” Dev cried out, leaping up from the bench and running over to try and yank the barbell off of his dad’s chest to no avail - the 800 pounds having come back to its full weight by this point.


“Whoa, that’s a real bummer, dude. Dad’s out colder than the reception to a new Pauly Shore movie, dude.” Dips said while shaking his head. “Is that topical, still?”


“GET THE WEIGHT OFF OF HIM, DIPS!” Dev screamed, balling his fists at his side.


“Oh yeah.” Dips swirled up into the air and fired off into the barbell, his luminescence surrounding it as he disappeared inside of it. The barbell raised up from the ground and floated in the air back to the rack, laying itself down gingerly onto the metal rungs. 


“Is he…?” Dev asked, clutching his hands together and looking around nerve-wracked.


Dips popped back into being and looked side to side at Devlin Jr. for a second, rubbing his chin, before he raised his ghostly shades up and looked once more. “Nah, he’s chill. He just knocked himself out and whatnot. No worries little dweebus.”


“He didn’t knock himself out! You knocked him out! Why didn’t you help lift the weight when HE was trying to lift it?!” Dev cried out, wildly gesticulating.


“I thought I was supposed to be hiding from your parents? That’s what you all told me, dude. You can’t blame me for followin’ orders.” Dips scratched at his chin for a moment. “I feel like I learned that’s a bad excuse in history class once…. Alright, my bad dude. I’m totally apologetic, my guy.”


Dev was just staring down at his dad, rubbing the back of his head and sweating idly. “Let’s… let’s go get my thumbdrive and get out of here before he wakes up…”


“Mondo prudent, bro.” Dips nodded sagely.


—-----------------------------------------------

Jason arrived at the car outside of the Durwood home first. He leaned against the back of it and breathed heavily in and out. He hadn’t felt this run down and beaten up in his life that he could remember. At least not physically.


But he didn’t get to spend long thinking about it before the garage door opened and Dev and Dips exited, Dev carrying an umbrella and Dips bein’ a dead ass ghost and whatnot so neither getting wet.


“Holy cow, are you ok, Jason?!” Dev called out, running over to him.


“Yeah… yeah… I’ll tell you on the road. We gotta get the hell out of here. Where are TK and Alyssa…?” Jason said evenly, rubbing his face with his palm. 


But before either of them could speculate, the front door opened and exactly those two people walked out - pretty godamn convenient for the story but still believably, CinemaSins. 


Without saying a word, TK walked around to the other side of the car and slid into the back seat on the passenger side, her arms crossed and her body slumped down in her seat.


“Is she alright?” Dev asked anxiously.


“Just get in the car.” Alyssa said coldly. “Tell me where we’re going and we’ll go. I guess I’m just the fucking driver now.”


Dev and Jason exchanged looks before Dev got into the front passenger seat and Dips apparated his ghostly dead ass into the car as well, who knows where that dude’s stayin’. Maybe the Ghost Car Dimension, who even knows.


Alyssa stepped up to the driver’s side door and looked Jason up and down before upturning her lip. “There’s a tarp under the seat, throw that down before you get in at least.” And then she ducked in as well.


Jason took one last look down the road toward the half-destroyed old junkyard.


“For Archie…” he repeated to himself.         The End
