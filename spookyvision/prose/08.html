Penumbra

Prompt: Masks & Autopsies

by Jeff Pennington

Needless to say the ride from Marshall to Buffalo Creek was extremely awkward and quiet. Pavlov Flinch had tried to spark a couple conversations about what women do with their used underwear but Kayla Hunter had shot him down each time, finally warning him that should he ever bring the subject up again she’d tie him by his nutsack to the back of the car and drag him behind the rest of the way.

Flinch played that game where you pretend Sonic the Hedgehog is running alongside the car on long road trips the rest of the way - which honestly wasn’t too long since it’s like a 10 minute drive.

Kayla pulled off the road at a completely indistinct place partway up the hollow, shutting the engine of her old beat-up 1968 BMW 2002 - better described as a ‘beemer’ at this point due to neglect over decades and decades by multiple owners. She threw open the door and began to step out

“What are you doing? You can’t piss out here, a squirrel will get up in there!” Flinch called out, seemingly in whatever passes for genuine concern for another human being for him.

“What?” Kayla twisted her head back around to gape at him, before shaking it and stepping the rest of the way out onto the dirt embankment. “No, no, this is as far as we can drive. The turnoff for Buffalo Creek Township used to be here before it disappeared. “ She paused for a moment before looking back at him once more, “You’re like the living shit stain on the grundle of humanity, aren’t you? Jesus.”

For his part, Flinch barely even registered the insult in that and slid out of the car himself. He peered around in both directions, seeing nothing but high weeds, forest, and two lane backroad surrounding them. He shoved his hands into his pockets and wistfully remembered Choco Tacos. Rest in peace, man, too good for this horrible world.

“Flinch! Come the fuck on, dude!” Hunter yelled after him, waving her hand for him to follow. She disappeared into the overgrowth pretty quickly, pressing on into the forest at the side of the road. She flipped open her cellphone, honestly somewhat stuck in the past as every Gen X-er, that’s right you jaded fuckers, we remembered you existed. You’re welcome. Anyway, there wasn’t any signal out here. She cursed under her breath a bit about that.

Flinch hadn’t owned a phone since he’d found that Trac-Phone in the Waffle House parking lot and then immediately gotten the shit beat out of him by some high school pot dealer named Joey Cheese. No, that prize belongs to Joey now. Or more than likely a landfill somewhere. He did have a beeper though - cause he fucks.

It felt like a pretty short walk through the overgrown trees and brush before the two of them emerged into a gigantic open field, where the grass only reached knee height. But the more immediate visual upon them was a gigantic double-metal rolled fence with barbed wire circlets across the top of it, three sets deep.

“Oh shit, that’s gonna rip my dick right offa me like an action figures leg in a lawnmower, man…” Flinch whined to himself, staring slack-jawed up at the razor sharp wire rings.

Hunter ignored him, rubbing her hand over the small faded steel sign at the edge of the fence, reading aloud as her fingers crossed the letters, “Dusk Corporation Chemical Dumping Grounds, No Unauthorized Admittance.”

“Why does that name sound familiar?” Flinch asked, finally paying attention to the story I’m writing him in right now. “Wasn’t that the books about the S&M vampire teens?”

“Could you do me and the human race a favor and stop breathing for like five minutes real quick, Flinch?” Hunter snapped at him, already starting to scale the fence hand over hand, her steel cane tucked underneath her arm.

Flinch stood stock-still watching her climb up, hands in his pockets, not even offering to move. She climbed with a grace and speed he hadn’t seen outside of anime, which he most assuredly didn’t watch. It was only a minute or two before she was at the barbed wire portion of the fence.

“Don’t put your tongue on it, trust me!” Flinch called up after her.

Hunter hung one hand from the fence, grasping the handle of her cane with the other and slid the sword within out carefully. Flinch watched in wonder, expecting her to swipe her sword around like a samurai and the barbed wire to just fall from the sky in a rain of confetti. Holy shit this is gonna be rad

Instead she just hacked at one side of the barbed wire to her left as hard as she could over and over until it split. Then she leaned over as far as she could and hacked away at the other side of it, using the tip of the blade to push the barbed wire off to the side, folding it over itself to make a 5 foot wide safe spot to climb over.

“LAAAAMMMEEE!” Flinch actually yelled out loudly, during their secret stealth infiltration.

“SSHHHHut the fuck up!!” Hunter scream-whispered back to him, resheathing her cane sword and shimmying down the other side of the fence. When her feet hit the ground, she was face to face with Flinch again, just on the other side of the fance. “Hurry up and get over here before you alert a passing plane with the light signals reflecting off your bald spot, you freaky little degenerate!”

“Body shaming is pretty low, Kayla. You should be ashamed of yourself.” Flinch tsk’d and shook his head.

“....where did you even learn that term?” Hunter said, bewildered. But she soon snapped out of it, “Look, just climb the damn fence and let’s go.”

As a writer it behooves me to spare you the next half hour of the two of them whisper-fighting through a fence. Just know that Flinch offered a lot of really stupid, unrealistic, anime-esque solutions for Hunter to help him to the other side and Hunter continuously calls him names that would make anyone with a shred of dignity cry about themselves.

Eventually he made it to the top of the fence, and then fell over it, landing in a lump in the dirt on the other side. He stumbled back to his feet, covered in dust and muck, but didn’t really seem to care much about it. Probably didn’t affect the smell any, to be honest.

If the path from the road to the fence had been surprisingly short, the path from the fence to literally anything except an open overgrown field on the inside was the exact opposite. Flinch literally stopped to piss like 3 times along the way, it was nuts how far it was. Or how bad his prostate was, depending on how you look at it.

Eventually a row of tents from one side of the fenced-in area to the other was visible, their backs turned towards the approaching intruders. Kayla Hunter ducked down and began to creep through the overgrown weeds, her hands tightly gripping the sword cane in its sheath. Flinch eventually got the idea and began to creep along behind her, but admittedly much slower - his knees were popping so loud he really didn’t wanna get yelled at about them, so he kept his distance.

Slowly inching up to the back of the tents, Hunter peered through one of the back window flaps, but heavy black mesh inside blocked any view into it. Undeterred, she slid around the side of the tent, throwing a hand back to grip onto Flinch’s overcoat lapel and drag him along with her. The two of them peaked around the corner of the tent, and even from their low vantage point what they saw in front of them was unbelievable.

From one side to the other it must have been a mile long, stretching into both directions beyond almost what they could see. A deep, spiraling, tiered pit, reaching down, down down into the ground below them almost too far for any evening light to reach - though there was precious little of that left anyway. It almost looked like a rock quarry, but it was far deeper, and far more extreme in its slope down and in. Everything in this massive hole reached into the earth further than either interloper had ever seen in their lives, save for a single spire of stone at one far end of it, reaching high above the hole, and though there was a staircase spiraling around and around it leading up, the top was far too high to see what was up there.

“Oh god, I’m probably gonna piss, “ Flinch said, his eyes wide as he stared down toward the hole in the short distance.

“God damn you gotta get a prostate exam…” Hunter muttered as she began to creep away from the tents and across to the edge of the massive hole.

Flinch followed, pondering whether he would be into a doctor putting a finger up there or not. He came to the conclusion that it depended on the doctor, and how safe they made him feel in their arms.

At the edge of the hole, the two of them gawked down at the sight deep, deep below - at the very bottom of the pit. Though light didn’t reach there and it was completely in shadow, it would be impossible not to see them down there. Hundreds of them, each of them wearing pure white but stained to the bone with black coal dust - each of them swinging a pickaxe or slinging a shovel, working feverishly to dig deeper still below the earth - and each of them glowing an unworldly pale white in the dark.

But it would have been absolutely impossible for Kayla Hunter not to recognize them instantly. In 1999 a ghastly train had pulled into the Buffalo Creek Train Depot and dropped off a seemingly endless swarm of people, all in white, who had disappeared headed toward Buffalo Creek Township. Now here they were, all of them, right before her eyes as if she’d never lost sight of them in the woods. The phantom sound of steel hitting rock and tool scraping tool was the only touch of reality that kept her from spiraling back into her memory completely.

“Oh shit sauce…!” Flinch whispered as he grabbed Hunter by her leather jacket and yanked her back away from the edge of the hole. He dragged her with little resistance back to their original hiding place behind the tents at the end of the camp, both of them tucking themselves behind just in time for a procession of a dozen robed figures stepped up from out of the hole, presumably using some unseen stairs to return. They walked slowly, side by side, swaying in time with dangling ornate golden incense burners waving at the front and tall banners waving from staves in the back. They all bore the same red and white robes the inhuman attacker at the library wore earlier.

Hunter and Flinch breathed heavily, but silently, awaiting them to pass, the sound of their hearts beating in their ears so loud that they both worried they’d be heard.

Eventually peaking back around the tent, the procession was gone, not even a hint of their burning incense in the air any longer. Hunter clicked her teeth in frustration. “These guys are so fucking creepy.”

“Yeah no doubt!” Flinch chimed in.

Hunter just shook her head at this blatant hypocrisy and moved around to the front of the tent again.

But without warning and seemingly from nowhere the footsteps approached again! Twelve sets of feet pounding against the dirt, heading straight for them! Both Hunter and Flinch looked around desperately to try and see where the sound was coming from but couldn’t see anything. Finally, adrenaline pushing her to do literally anything, Hunter latched onto Flinch’s shoulders and pushed him through the hanging flap at the front of one of the tents, following in immediately after.

In the dark inside, the two of them ducked underneath a table, shivering silently, tucked in as close as possible to keep from being seen should someone walk in. And in the darkness they stayed, motionless, with bated breath, waiting for the sounds of footfalls to find them. But finally when they did, they all stopped, seemingly right outside the front flap of the tent, light from an incense burner the only thing tipping off Hunter and Flinch that they were there, alongside the murmuring of hushed voices.

A minute passed… another… another… and then the light moved away. The sound of a dozen feet plodding against the dirt, in every direction but into the tent, filled their ears until fading away into silence. The two of them exhaled a sigh of relief and then climbed out from under the table.

“Apologies for hotboxing you in there.” Flinch stated flatly as he stood up in the darkness.

“I hope you die.” Hunter responded just as flatly. She was rustling around in the darkness for a moment or two before a flashlight clicked on in her hand, turning over the room around them slowly.

There were military-style metal shelves lined up haphazardly around the room with glass jars on them, filled with some strange purple liquid and though all of them were far too hazy and dark to tell, a few of them absolutely had something else floating inside, unseen. Beyond the jars were stacks of papers of some kind, seemingly old and withered by weather and age, stacked haphazardly as if they weren’t incredibly important. Flinch pocketed a pretty large red gem from one of those shelves as well, before Hunter had even had the chance to see it. That’s Dog Track money, right there!

Beakers, test tubes, and small metal instruments were strewn over tables in the center of the room, around a large, central wooden table, long and heavy.

And laying across the table, splayed out with its incredibly long legs dangling over the bottom edges and its thin, spindly arms dangling almost the floor from the sides was a seemingly humanoid being.

Flinch went to scream but Hunter clasped her hand over his mouth, motioning harder with the flashlight for him to look at it again.

Its skin was obsidian black, but over top of it was a cracked and half-missing layer of gold - not so much metal in nature but powdery and organic - like reflective stone. Its body was so long and thin it had to have reached over 10 feet tall if standing upright, but thankfully, as much as could be said in this situation, it was abundantly clear this thing was long, long dead. It’s chest cavity was wide open, and purple liquid pooled inside of it, most of the area within pink and purple and emptied of its major organs save a few floating in the viscous goo. Perhaps most disturbingly, the place where a face would have been on this thing’s head had been sheared completely off, leaving a bare inhuman skull underneath, with pools of purple, semi-hardened goo trailing around the wounds where it was cut from.

Flinch continued trying to scream every time the flashlight would move onto a different part of this thing's body, but Hunter continued to hold his mouth shut harder. All of this genuinely took a lot of the terror out of the situation for her, to be real honest with you.

But the silence of this scene was broken abruptly by the loud blaring of an old timey air raid siren which pierced through the two of them like a knife, causing Hunter to drop the flash light and for Flinch to jerk clear enough to scream finally - but thankfully the sound of the siren was far too loud for anyone to hear him.

As the raid siren continued, Hunter peaked out of the flap at the front of the tent, squinting as hard as she could through the darkness outside now that the sun had completely set.

Before there were dozens of them in their high pointed red robes, now there were easily over a hundred of them, their hoods pulled down low over their face to showcase the strange, runic symbol etched into the front of them. They stood in a gigantic circle around the massive hole in the earth, and chanted something that was incapable of being heard over the siren. At the other end of the man-made crater, past the tall stone tower erected at its edge, the hooded figures stood in a crowd, shoulder to shoulder, raising their hands up to the obelisk before them in praise.

The air raid siren ended and even squinting in the darkness Hunter could see the single robed figure standing atop the stone tower in the far distance, thanks to the tower now being wreathed with flaming torches in the night. All of this had happened so suddenly, with no sound, no motion in the air, it was all happening so fast.

For his part, Flinch had crawled over to the back of the tent and had begun to yank up on the fabric of it as hard as he could to dislodge it from the ground. After heaving with all his might as quietly as he could several times, one of the pitons in the ground came loose and he lifted the edge of it just enough to wriggle out into the chilling night’s air on the other side.

Hunter turned around to check on him just in time to see his ass slide out through the gap he’d made in the tent and disappear. “God damn it, you fucking traitorous bitch…!” she hissed through clenched teeth.

She peered back out at the hundred strong congregation and punched the ground, grabbing her phone and ruefully dialing 911 into it. This was the absolutely last thing she wanted to do but there wasn’t much choice. There wasn’t even a ring before the harsh sound of a click hurt her ear, and another softer click harkened a voice. “Hello?”

Flinch ran, full tilt, back in the direction that they had come across the long field. He huffed and puffed harder and harder as he went, but he was determined to fuck off as fast and as far as possible, so he pressed on. That is, until he felt his foot slide and the earth gave out below him.

This was no sinkhole he fell into. It was deep… deeper and darker than even the pit they had seen before. And the walls were sheer, dug on purpose, not that they hurt any less to be bashing against as he tumbled through the darkness further and further down. He fell for what felt like an eternity. Even Pavlov Flinch, being a man as deep as a puddle, began to believe in the infinite in that moment, and in the possibility that he was descending to hell.

But eventually, deep down below… his descent… stopped. Suddenly, and abruptly. He couldn’t feel his arms or legs from the beating he had taken falling, but for a moment, before the sensation came back. He was tangled in something…. Rope? It was around both of his legs and had twisted around his midsection. The next thing he realized was that he was upside down… dangling. He thrashed but for a moment, but felt the rope loosening around his waist a little and stopped.

Finally he opened his eyes, expecting utter darkness, instead he saw something his mind had never in a lifetime dreamed he would see. Instead of an endless darkness, or even a subterranean cave, he saw, far below him, hundreds of feet in fact, a sprawling system of buildings. There must have been hundreds of them… thousands? Different sizes and shapes, each with blackened windows in them, long forgotten by time. But the architecture.. Was like nothing he’d ever seen before. Jagged and brutal but perfectly aligned… and silver. Everything was illuminated in this effervescent silver light that seemingly came from the streets of the cityscape itself, though he could not see past the rooftops and buildings to know. He stared, mouth agape, the peril of his position completely lost on him.

But amidst the reverie there was a groaning beneath the earth far below him, as if the bedrock beneath began to shift and turn far beyond where eyes could reach. Flinch began to panic, feeling the ropes tighten around his legs and begin to shift downward for a moment. He thrashed, his body swaying in the air before something yanked him back upward into the endless dark tunnel he had fallen down. His head slammed into the stone inside once again as he began to be hoisted back up toward the surface, and all went black.

Flinch slowly opened his eyes, his entire body feeling like it was on fire with pain. He squealed out a very unmanly groan and rolled over onto his back. His vision was so hazy, and his hearing was nothing but a high pitched buzz but slowly both began to clear up, though he may have wished differently.

Standing over him was a tall, thin man wearing a red and white robe, with a high pointed hood. In his right hand he brandished a jagged kris dagger with a bronze blade, and in his left hand he held an incredibly old brown leather book with metallic clasps all over it. He was screaming about something, swinging the dagger around and pointing down at Flinch over and over, and every time he tried to yank away, but he quickly found his hands were tied tightly behind his back and he was so beaten and battered it wouldn’t have made any difference

The man yanked back his hood away from his face, but revealed nothing as simple as a face beneath it. Instead, a mask adorned his face, of twisted obsidian flesh, flecked all over in golden stone that flowed off of it like powder on the wind. There were no features upon this face save a single half-lidded, lifeless eye in its center, and around the edges ran purple, viscous blood. The man was wearing the face of the thing from the tent… Flinch wanted to vomit, but couldn’t for blind fear.

“TONIGHT! Tonight The Acolytes of the Third Birth are vindicated! Tonight the blood moon gives us our rightful future! Tonight we witness the birth of God’s third son… not a spirit, or a teacher, but a DESTROYER! Behold…! Witness the epoch of the UMBRALBORN!” The masked man screamed in an inhuman cadence, raising both his dagger and his book to the sky.

Flinch could barely see over the edge of the stone pillar he was laid upon but he could still see the hundred-strong throng of hooded figures far below, all of them raising their heads to the sky to scream and chant in unison, throwing their hands up in reverence.

Flinch looked up as well. And there, filling the sky up from horizon to horizon, was the blood moon. It was so close that you could finally see the surface of it for what it was. For the first time in his life, Flinch didn’t see the pock-marked barren dust surface of the moon, but endless undulating flesh turning over upon itself over and over, and bone pushing against the surface in a thousand writhing growths in peaks and valleys.

He screamed, though no one could hear it, no one cared. He could feel the indifference of the entire universe at his plight in his very bones and he wanted to bury himself into the stone to escape it.

“Tonight we will spill the blood of a nonbeliever… and that blood shall be the placenta of holy birth! God’s angels have suffered long enough at the hands of nonbelievers…! God’s first children… they were made in his image first! They were given a world… the silver city… first! But humanity stripped them of their world…. Tonight… tonight they will take it back! Tonight the true believers shall be baptised in the blood of the second children and ascend…! We, who gathered the lost souls to feed a newborn god..! We, who offer them up freely now until you..! We shall become ANGELS JUST AS WE WERE PROMISED!!” The masked man screamed again, his religious fanaticism causing him to convulse there on the stone pulpit above them all.

Flinch felt the dagger’s edge press to his throat, and held his breath as tightly as he could. He could not shut his eyes… he could not blink… the burning heat of staring at the convulsing moon above him searing his pupils. He could barely see the white-clad, soot covered workers from deep in the hole below slowly float up into the air and into the burning red aurora in the sky. Screaming as they disappeared into nothingness.

The convulsing flesh and bone of the moon began to recede away from its center… opening the sky above them into a torrent of motion that Flinch’s eyes could not fathom. A red maelstrom at the center of a complexity he couldn’t comprehend, even staring directly at it.

He felt a small trickle of blood as the masked man continued to scream something he could no longer hear.

The maelstrom was a gateway.. He somehow even knew that before the thing appeared within it. The swirling golden thing, with eyes focused upon him, a light within its core brighter red than anything he had ever witnessed. He began to froth at the mouth, but he could not know that. All he knew was it was coming closer to him, gleaming in a light that felt like seeing the light for the first time being born into a new world. It’s eyes, unblinking, would not leave him, even as it’s wings unfurled from the sides of it’s gargantuan body, filling up the sky with searing hot white light. It was too big to fathom, it’s shadow blotting out the once-ubiquitous crimson light of the blood moon.

BOOOOOOOOM!! BOOOM! BOOM!

Explosions began to rock the area, and the dagger left Flinch’s throat. He fell over instantly onto the ground, not having even registered the masked man had been holding him upright the entire time. The feeling of no longer meeting the thing in the sky’s gaze was a relief unlike any he had ever felt in his life, or would ever feel again. He squinted through teary eyes back at the masked man, who was screaming with his hands on the sides of his head.

“NO…! NO…! You cannot stop The Umbralborn’s ascension…! You cannot ruin everything we’ve worked for…!”

The crowd was screaming, not in reverie any longer, but in fear and confusion, as explosions rocked the ground they stood on, sending them flying in the air, sometimes into pieces. The masked man went to scream once more and could not. A silver blade hung out the front of his neck but for a moment, then swiped hard to the side, sending his masked head tumbling down off the side of the stone pillar.

His blood splattered all over the stone deus between them, staining the rock deep, dark red in its wake.

Standing where the masked man once stood was a tall, thin  man dressed in black with pallid skin and black shiny hair. He wore a pair of scarlet red sunglasses, the only bit of color on his whole person. Flanking him on one side was a gigantic man, who had to have been 8 feet tall, at least from where Flinch lay, and was so bearded and hairy that once could barely make out a face on him, though he too was clad in black. All three were completely done up in black in fact, as on the thin man’s other side was a very small man in a black wide-brimmed hat and bolo tie who was eating…a burrito? They seemed so out of place that Flinch felt the strange need to laugh, though he could not fathom why.

As he lost consciousness there lying on the cold stone of the deus the final thing he could remember seeing is the thin man in red glasses throwing his head back and laughing with a fervor that bordered on insane, especially amidst the explosions and screaming rocking the entire area around them. His vision faded… and the screams faded.. And the explosions faded…and finally the laughter was gone too.

—-----------------------

Pavlov Flinch opened his eyes. The sun was so bright that he could barely keep them open for a moment, but he blinked enough times to finally focus them. He looked around, bewildered, to find himself seated on the barely padded seats of a Greyhound bus. He went to stand, but his legs wouldn’t get under him well enough and he just plopped back into his seat.

He then let out a blood curdling scream, as loud as he possibly could.

Every other person on the bus turned to look at him, startled and enraged, without a hint of empathy in them. The busdriver slowed down on the old two-lane backroad they were driving on, and turned around in his seat, glaring at Flinch from under his flat cap.

“YOU KNOW DA RULES, FUCKBOY.” the busdriver grumble-screamed, tapping the laminated sign affixed to the front wall of the bus which read ‘Scream on your own time, everybody’s life fucking sucks’.

He turned back around and sped back up to normal speed. Flinch sat silently for a moment and blinked a few times. He was trying as hard as he could to remember how he had gotten on this bus.

Come to think of it… when had he left Huntington at all? He had met with Kayla S. Hunter, from the journal… he remembered that. The two of them had gotten along better than most people get along with him - he was sure he was gonna score this time. But they had gotten into a car and drove… somewhere… and then what happened…?

He sat there trying to place information together he didn’t have for a very long time, until he turned to the woman in the seat across from him suddenly. She grasped her purse tighter to her chest, having been staring at him this entire time now.

“W-where is this bus going…?” Flinch asked, finding it hard to speak, his throat hurting so much.

“N-north…” the old lady sputtered, sliding across the seat to be as far away from him as possible. “Toward New York.”

Flinch sat back in his seat, his mind a jumble. Suddenly out of the fog he remembered something deathly important… the DOG RACING MONEY! Somehow he’d picked up a big old gem he could hawk to make money to bet on the doggies or the ponies or even the BLOWIES!

He thrusted his hand into his overcoat pocket and found….His old blue see-through beeper. There was a message from Kayla Hunter on it from an hour ago. He’d check it later. What really caught him off guard was a small black business card where the gem had been. Maybe he misremembered that as well? Nothing else was coming to him.

He turned over the card in his hand and squinted at the gold-pressed lettering on one side of it.

“Indrid Cold…” he read out loud to himself, looking over the card for any other info. On the other side of it was an address, “1313 Mockingbird Lane, Whitesville, Connecticut.”

He stared at the card for a minute, turning it over in his hand as if to search it for even the slightest clue beyond the text printed on it. Something about it seemed so deeply familiar that he couldn’t turn away from it.

So he pulled down the window and hucked it the fuck out of the bus.

He slumped back into his seat, turning his head slightly to look out the window. He imagined Sonic the Hedgehog running alongside for a couple minutes, then the exhaustion of whatever the hell he had gone through in the past however many days began to slowly overtake him. He fell deep asleep to the hum of the bus’ engine and for the first time in many, many months had not a single nightmare.

Elsewhere, The Acolytes of the Third Birth remained undaunted… there would always be another blood moon.

The End.

Pavlov Flinch will return in “The Ball-Tease Falcon”
