Beneath Third Avenue

Prompts: Politicians & Ziggurats

By: Jeff Pennington

The sun burned high and steady in the air above the campus of Marshall University, nestled deep in the heart of Huntington, West Virginia. The busy students moved to and fro, on their way to classes or lectures, literally bleeding money out of every pore like a gaping wound - money that was siphoned down invisibly into the school itself like a tick on the ass of a dog hopeful of one day earning itself a meal - but somehow this wasn’t the horror part of the story yet.

One of those students was studious, manic, obsessive Myrtle Smellie. Yes, that is her actual name, it’s not a joke, fuck you if you laughed at that JOSH AND RICH. Myrtle was rushing a little faster than the crowds around, ducking and diving around people as she headed down to third avenue and waited for the light to change so she could cross to the Weisberg Engineering Building across the street.

Side note - that building is actually named after the guy who founded the copper company I used to work at. I never met him personally cause he was dead as fuck by the time I started to work there but his son was the head honcho - well into his 50’s at that point. The funniest thing about this is that Weisberg Jr. looked EXACTLY like the portrait of his dad he kept in his office. It was fucking uncanny. I made a joke once during a lunch that the older Weisberg must have just faked his death to carry on as the new one and everyone got really quiet and one of the women at the table shamed me for making fun of the dead and everyone agreed and I was straight up fucking incredulous.

After that long, boring, and ultimately pointless story you must figure the light had changed and Myrtle could cross by now, right? Fuckin wrong baby, welcome to Huntington. Eventually she gave up and Frogger’d her way across, dipping, ducking, and diving at the last moment to avoid a giant truck pancaking her before she got to the sidewalk. Not that every single fucking vehicle on the road in Huntington isn’t a giant truck, but I digress.

She took the steps two by two, her crocs clacking with a plastic hollowness off of the linoleum, and once she made it to the third floor she took off at a full sprint. It would have been impressive the speed a tiny nerd like her could get to if she didn’t instantly slam into a man carrying a gigantic box of papers who flipped over her shoulder like a fucking judo tournament and went sailing down the stairs behind her, papers flying into he air like a bomb had gone off and his voice crying out with every strike into a step he hit.

“AGH! FUCK! SHIT! AGH! GOD! DAMNIT! I STILL! HAVE TO PAY! STUDENT LOANS?! FUCK shit! Agh….fuck…shit..” A distant thud ended the symphony of pain that filled the empty late afternoon halls.

Meanwhile, Myrtle hadn’t even slowed down enough to notice, tuck and rolling under the larger man as he tripped over her and keepin on’ keepin’ on. She was gonna be late for her first day of work as a teacher’s assistant if she slowed down for even a second! That could go on your PERMANENT RECORD! And she believed in such a thing more fervently than any god or demon… for now. (thunder crack sfx)

She turned the final corner and skidded to a stop like Sonic the Hedgehog, hands on the ground in a full three-point landing pose and everything. An old wooden door stretched up above her diminutive height, black letters across the gold plate next to it reading “Professor Kayla S. Hunter, Engineering & Development Dept.” clear as day.

“OH BOY!” Myrtle squealed out, performing what can only be described as a Seal Team Six tactical entry kick on the door, sending it flying open and slamming against the door stopper behind it. Myrtle rushed forward and was met with the door rattling back fast and hard into her forehead, sending her sprawling out onto the cold hard ground, a loud yelp the only sound she could muster.

“What the FUCK is going on out here?!” Kayla Hunter poked her head out the door into the hallway, pissed as a motherfucker at someone kicking her god damn door open while she was trying to finish the paperwork on this new stupid intern they were saddling her with or whatever the hell she was. Ironically, she realized after a moment, that the mangled fallen body in the hall in front of her WAS that intern. She sighed.

Miraculously, Myrtle leapt up to her feet like a cartoon missing frames, from floor to standing in an instant, her hand held out for a shake. “SORRY IF I’M LATE! My name is Myrtle Smellie, and I’m your new teaching assistant! I rushed here as fast I could because I’m always reliable, responsible, and RENEGADE!” she posed with her fingers pointed like guns when she yelled the last bit.

Kayla looked back into the office at the clock hung high on the wall next to the “I Believe” poster from the X-Files she had hung completely unironically because you fuckin’ know why at this point. She looked back out the door with anger on her face, “YOU’RE TWO HOURS EARLY!...wait, Smellie?”

Myrtle slammed her hand into her forehead in an extreme solute, the force rattling the huge glasses on her face and stood stock straight, jutting her jaw forward, “I’M ALWAYS READY FOR DUTY!”

“.....piss off, come back at 4.” Kayla slammed the door shut hard, the wind sending Myrtle’s wild curly hair spiraling out of control around her face. She tilted her head in confusion for a moment, and then scratched it in deep thought. What had she done wrong?

“I don’t get paid enough for this…” Kayla murmured to herself as she walked back over to her desk and plopped down into the old worn leather chair she’d bought herself to furnish it. The rolling office chair always felt like it wasn’t fitting for a professor slash adventurer. Would Indiana Jones sit in a rolly polly seat from Ikea? That just wasn’t up to the task of his ass in her opinion. She leaned back into the chair and turned the small TV on top of the adjacent filing cabinets back on. The episode of Mama’s Family where she heckles a stand-up comic and then has to do her own comedy routine was on and that was one of Kayla’s favorites. She wasn’t gonna miss it for an overachiever with an overbite.

By this time Myrtle had figured out the problem - she hadn’t been assertive enough! She drew back and field-goal kicked the door open again, this time sending the metal fittings around the latch to fly off in every direction, and the door to list slightly to the side and drag on the carpet to stop. “I’M READY TO WORK… FOR YOU!”

“What the flying FUCK are you DOING?!” Kayla screamed. But then she stopped. This kid was… weird but in a.. Useful way maybe? That -was- one hell of a kick. “Wait, wait.. Don’t tell me, don’t tell me. You’re here for the teacher’s assistant position starting today, I got it. I just haven’t finished the paperwork just yet.”

Myrtle deflated like a balloon filled with not enough air, her gigantic beaming toothy smile dropping off her face like a wet noodle. This might be the least realistic character I’ve ever written and I created Frankenstein, P.I.

She drug her feet behind her into the room and slowly pushed the door back shut behind her, the edge dragging hard and loud against the carpet until it finally shut. “B…b…bb…ut…I need the credits so baaaaaddd!”

“Whoa, jesus, stop, stop, you’re still hired, you’re still gonna get the credits.” Kayla’s reassurance caused Myrtle to snap back to normal instantaneously, again like there were animation frames missing in between. Kayla actually jumped at this.

“Uh, look… I’ve got an errand to run. I was gonna have it done and be back before you came this evening but... Again… you’re two hours early so I never got the chance. You can come with me to Morrow Library though, I think you might be helpful.”

“OH YEEEAAAAHHH!” she yelled out, spinning her arm around in a wild air guitar celebration that went on WAY too long. I’m talking like a full minute of her going like “WEEDLY WEEDLY WAAAHH WEEDLY WAAAHH” while Kayla just sat there, staring blankly and rubbing at the bridge of her nose intermittently.

“What are we lookin’ for?” Myrtle finally asked. “Some cool old book about BUILDINGS? Or BUILDING BUILDINGS? Or building on building buildings to learn about building buildings?”

Jeff took a moment to actively regret writing this character into this story and think about whether or not to switch them out at this point. It’s only page 3, that’s doable right?

Kayla slid her leather bomber jacket on and picked up her silver cane from the umbrella holder by the door. “We’re looking for a hole.”

For the first time since she was created, Myrtle looked both worried and just a little curious about what kinda hole we were talkin’ about.

—------------------------------------

A few minutes later Kayla and Myrtle stood in front of the security guard at the ancient-looking entrance to the underground Morrow Library Stacks. The student security was reading a book called “A Modest Proposal” as he ate a sandwich voraciously when they arrived, but dutifully looked over their IDs as they passed them over to him.

“You’re good to go, Professor Hunter. Your weird hobbit companion can’t use a Book It! Club Card as ID here though. She is entitled to a single small personal pan pizza at any participating Pizza Hut though, it seems.”

Kayla placed her hand on her forehead and scraped it down her face in frustration, “Give the man your STUDENT ID CARD, MYRTLE.”

“Ok, ok but it’s a really bad picture! Michelangelo looks WAY better on my BookIt card and we’re both party dudes…” she muttered under her breath, digging in her backpack for a short while before returning with her actual ID and passing it over.

The security guard remotely unlocked the old wooden doors to the stacks and Kayla pushed onward, disappearing behind them along with her new extremely annoying charge. You know the drill about Morrow by now - round and round they went through dimly lit, stucco-surrounded hallways of bookshelves covered every inch by old books, documents, tomes, and more. Kayla had made this trip every other day since last year when that scumbag Pavlov Flinch and she had seen something they shouldn’t have seen deep down here.

While being chased by an eldritch abomination beyond human comprehension would probably rank highest in the memory of anyone involved in that day the one thing that had stuck with Kayla above everything else was what they had stumbled on by complete accident while running for their lives - a gigantic yawning maw of a hole in the foundation of the stacks - a good half a mile below the surface.

But every time she had retraced her steps before, she was unable to find the hole again. There were times when she was so sure she was in the right place that she would stake her life on it but in the hole’s place was just another wall with a row of books against it. Normal, boring journals about local wildlife, too. Not a trace of anything out of the ordinary.

But this time felt different. As Kayla followed the path before, by herself, she had felt lost and unsure of where she was going but this time every step felt correct, perfectly in place. And on a more esoteric level - every time she had come here before there had been the uneasy feeling that she was being watched… maybe even followed, that this time never hit her. Maybe bringing the newly minted teacher’s assistant wasn’t such a bad idea after all.

There was a moment where Kayla couldn’t remember where she was supposed to turn or what aisle to walk down - where everything started spinning around her for just a solitary second - and then there they were. From floor to ceiling in front of them, in the back corner of the floor, was a gigantic black open cavernous hole - the wind softly whistling out of it past them.

Kayla took a step back, confusion welling up inside of her, the unease gripping her very heart at how she got here. She wasn’t even on the right floor before was she? She remembered at least another twenty minutes of movement before they got here before - probably way more since they were running last time. How in the holy fuck was she here now? What had just happened to her?

“Do I go to you to get my parking pass validated this semester, or…?” Myrtle was leaned directly into her ear, causing her to jump suddenly from the silence breaking.

“WHAT? UH… fucking I don’t know. No, I don’t think so, I… aren’t you wondering what the fuck this big hole in the wall is?”

“You said we were looking for a hole, so I’m not super surprised. WELP we found it, now we can go get my parking pass validated and I can START TEACHIIIINNNN” she started to air guitar again and Kayla grabbed her wrist instantly to stop her.

“That’s not how any of this works. Now calm down, we’re goin’ in there. It could be dangerous so keep that same energy for kicking.”

“Uh… what?” Myrtle’s attitude changed a little and she took a step away from the hole. “This isn’t in my contract, am I getting time and a half for this? Is my insurance gonna cover any spelunking injuries?!”

“Time and a… YOU’RE AN INTERN! You don’t get paid, you get credits for graduation!” Kayla snapped.

“I want credits and a half.” Myrtle smiled widely, shaking her head smugly for effect.

“Stay here then, save me from yourself.” Kayla waved her off, reaching into her jacket and retrieving a flashlight from within. She flicked it on and pointed it into the massive hole in the wall but even with its million lumen candle number she couldn’t see to the back. Unnerving as that was, she held a very special silver cane in her other hand, so was at least somewhat at ease with the decision she made next - walking directly into it.

Myrtle ran after, her crocs not getting the best purchase on the stone floor of the cavern they were now traversing, but she did ok. “You can’t fire me though, I really need the credits to graduate in the spring. I’m gonna be a doctor!”

Kayla looked back at her, eyebrow raised, “Doctor of what…?”

“Engineering.” Myrtle said plainly.

Kayla faced eyes forward again, silently mouthed the word ‘damn’, then pushed on.

The cavern seemed to continue on for so long that Kayla lost track of time completely. It could have been a half hour, it could have been multiple hours, but they walked for a very, very long time. Myrtle kept trying to explain to Kayla that having a Book It! Card in 2023 was actually a great idea because Pizza Points never depreciate in value - and when the market finally collapses on bitcoin then investors are gonna come RUNNING. For her part Kayla didn’t listen to a single word of it. She had gotten all the pizza points she’d ever needed back in the 90’s, when a personal pan pizza was as good as gold.

Then there was a light far in the distance - a murky blue light that pulsed just slightly like a flickering flame. The two unlikely traveling companions exchanged glances and then took off at a jog, both of them thankful the oppressive darkness would finally be behind them in a moment. As she got closer, Kayla began to feel a pit develop in her stomach. The light belonged to someone or something intelligent enough to make it.

The light was blinding for a moment as they came out the other side of the cavern tunnel into the iridescent blue light at its end, and Kayla covered her eyes for just a moment before they adjusted enough to look ahead.

“OH MY GORD!” Myrtle yelled first, and as Kayla looked at what she beheld, she couldn’t help but agree.

Sprawled out in front of them was a mass of rising smooth stone buildings, carved so perfectly symmetrically to be beyond the realm of human hands - rising five, ten, twenty stories into the air under the canopy of stone above them, jagged and rough hewn with stalactites, some which hung down and met the tops of the buildings. A cityscape stretched out before them, beneath the earth above them, unlike any either of them had ever seen. Far beyond where their eyes could see it still did not terminate. The forms were pock-marked with square and round dark windows, and spiraling markings in purples and cyans that read like no language ever seen before.

They stood transfixed in the light, until the dawning realization flooded over Kayla, her eyes darting around frantically through the city streets below them, to the high ceiling a mile above - nowhere. The light that lit every square inch of this endless unspeakably ancient city - it was coming from absolutely nowhere. It clung in the air like a miasma, brighter in some spots and dimmer in others, but never dark, no matter where she looked. The wind down here was strong… and again, coming from seemingly nowhere. Her hair, jacket, and pants legs fluttered and flapped in the breeze and she had to hold onto the edge of the cave opening to steady herself. They were at the top of a gigantic spiraling set of stairs that led down and away from them, all the way up to a monolithic set of gates, wrought out of stone, that stood… ajar? What could open something so massive…?

“Down there… look there..!” Kayla called out over the rising wind, pointing to the center of this end of the city. To where all the roads below converged.

An incredibly massive structure that would take up multiple city blocks was placed at the epicenter - a ziggurat of perfectly geometric stone, glowing a faint blue as if from inside of the stones of its makeup itself. The form rose up so high that even from the top of the stairs above the city the top of it wasn’t visible to them and would it not have been surrounded by such ghastly blue light from nowhere it would have shadowed the entirety of the city below it.

At each corner that was visible to them, a statue stood. And the realization barely ebbed into her mind before she felt the chill in her blood - each one of them was the same elongated, golden touched form of the body she had found in the tent during the blood moon ritual. She opened her mouth to express something, anything, to get this thought out of her mind as she desperately wanted to, but it was interrupted too quickly

By a stone slamming into the back of her head, sending her to the ground with a single stroke, and denying her the consciousness to continue.

“I think you’ve looked enough…” Myrtle sneered, dropping the blooded rock off the side of the staircase.

—--------------------------------------------

“Well why did you let her make it here?” a man’s voice brought Kayla back to consciousness. Her head swirled and the echoing words took a long time to finally escape her brain. She rolled over slightly, opening her bleary eyes and waiting for them to adjust to the murky blue light that surrounded her still.

“You said I was meant to bring a sacrifice, so I brought a sacrifice!” She recognized this one. It wasn’t as cartoonish or loud but it was most assuredly Myrtle Smellie. At this point she was hoping that was an alias because it sucked dick as a villain's name.

“You brought a member of the Silverblood Society, you moron! Don’t you understand that they’re the ones who stopped the Blood Moon Ritual LAST TIME?” the man’s voice erupted furiously. There was something incredibly familiar about it…

Her eyes were adjusted by this point but all she could make out was there was a man in a suit with gray hair standing with his back to her and Myrtle was standing in front of him, talking up at him. By this point, Kayla also realized she wasn’t tied up with anything. After years of doing shit like this she’d gotten really good at waking up faster than could be anticipated but it felt really stupid not to tie her up first.

“Silverblood Society?! She ain’t no freak like them, she’s just a lady!” Myrtle snapped back, aggravation in her voice.

The man held up a hand and she backed off, losing the fire in her eyes immediately. “Remember your place. Remember who you’re speaking to.”

“Sorry, Lord Billiams.” Myrtle said demurely, her hands clasping behind her back and held bowing.

Billiams…? Wait… that build, the gray hair, the voice…? Kayla thought to herself, feeling her strength returning to her. More importantly, she finally realized where she was - on top of one of the high towers of the ziggurat she had seen from afar earlier, which was barely large enough for them to be standing on together.

“She has THIS, you fool.” The man held up Kayla’s cane, and gripped onto the hilt of it, yanking the silver blade from inside of it, shining brightly in the blue haze. “This is a Silverblood Society weapon. They don’t just leave these laying around for anyone to find!”

Ironically, Kayla had gotten hers because a guy she suspected of being in the Silverblood Society had left it on the table at a restaurant when he went to take a shit and she knicked it for study. It certainly came in hand the next time a cricket man showed up, I’ll tell you that for free. AAAAAAnyway

Kayla shot up from the ground and snatched the cane and blade from the man’s hand, spinning around and latching her arm around Myrtle’s throat tightly. She yanked her small form up from the ground and held the small portion of the cane sword that was unsheathed up to her neck. “STOP RIGHT THERE.”

The man smiled at her and her suspicions were completely proven. Standing there in front of her, in an underground city below the surface of Huntington, West Virginia, was its three-term mayor-elect John T. Billiams. She almost dropped the sword but maintained a grip on it at the last moment, but she couldn’t stop her jaw from dropping. “...YOU?”

“Welp… that’s unfortunate.” Billiams sighed, sliding his hands into his coat pockets and rocking back on his heels.

“Hold it! Hand where I can see ‘em or the loud geek gets it!” Kayla screamed, backing up one step and feeling the edge of the tower top with her heel.

Billiams shrugged his shoulders. “You’d honestly be doing me a favor.”

“HEY!!” Myrtle squealed out, leaning forward in anger but feeling the blade push into her neck. She slid back into the hold.

“Don’t take it so personally, Myrt. We need a human sacrifice here and you’re as good a sacrifice as any. Besides, this lady isn’t gonna be leaving Exzenchelleft any time soon. Is she, boys?”

From behind Billiams, multiple sets of elongated fingers slithered over the edge of the stone deus they were all standing on. Tall, sloped, pointed red hoods raised up over the edge next, deeply inset darkness underneath them save for dozens of small, yellow, glowing eyes that seeped a strange yellow incandescent goo onto the stone tower top. The unmistakable robes of the Acolytes of the Third Birth fluttered tattered and strained from the shoulders of massive, dark beasts who’s body jutted multiple small arms from the shoulders and back like spines on a porcupine.

Terror willed in Kayla’s chest beyond her control and she desperately looked for any way to escape. Behind her was nothing but a straight fall down onto another stone level of the ziggurat, but just to the side of Billiams she saw a hatch in the tower roof.

With all of her might she flung Myrtle into Billiams, sending both of them careening backward into the oncoming deformed beasts, all of them intertwining and struggling not to fall back over the edge. Kayla took her chance, diving onto the roof and yanking the hatch open. By the time she’d ducked into it and was yanking it closed behind her, a massive recurved claw jammed into the crack at its edge and slashed across her face, barely grazing her but shocking her enough to send her falling off the ladder beneath the hatch.

BAM! Her back hit the hard stone at the bottom and her sword cane went clattering across the floor away from her. Everything around her was stone and hazy blue but the siren call of the horrors above her filled up her senses far more than her surroundings could. She struggled to her knees and clattered across the floor to her sword, grabbing it just as the hatch above the ladder was ripped off its hinges and thrown away into the distance.

Scrambling to her feet she unsheathed the sword and held it straight up into the air as one of the massive beasts fell down directly onto her, the blade piercing it from front to back and scorching the inside of it out with the silver tinge of its make. The beast screamed an ear-splitting inhuman dissonance and flailed its arms from the searing pain of the blade, but the heft of its body overtook Kayla immediately, pinning her to the ground underneath it.

“AGGHHHH!!” Kayla screamed out, being crushed under the weight, but jagged, clawed hands grabbed the body and wrenched it from on top of her, freeing her. The second beast was her momentary savior, who threw the first away like its comrade meant absolutely nothing to him, the body bouncing off the stone wall and laying limp and dead.

Kayla had a moment of relief to see the doorless exit at the end of the stone ziggurat, next to where the beast had landed before its kin swiped its gigantic hand at her, sending sparks flying from its skidding against the floor. With all the force left in her at that moment, she pressed her boots to the ground and pushed off, doing a weak, awkward somersault directly between the massive beasts swinging claw and his body and landing crouched on the other side.

She ran, and she ran hard. Passing the first downed beast, she latched both hands onto the blade of her cane sword and yanked it hard from inside of its, sending a torrent of blue-tinged blood pouring out of it. She looked back at the sheath sitting on the floor in the distance, oozing the green purification slime from within it but the many-eyed second beast stepped between her and it, screeching it’s virulent scream, and charged after.

Into the street she ran. Laying face down against the stone ground of the ceiling in a widening puddle of blood was Myrtle, body twisted and broken. She must have fallen off in the scuffle.  She didn’t even pause, continuing to run. Across the road she ran. Down the alley she ran. Up the street she ran. On and on, and the thing kept coming, matching her every move. There was no way to tell whether she was going further into this nightmarish underground city or getting closer to the massive stone gates that lead to the cavern out, but she pushed on blindly anyway.

But the beast was larger, and did not tire as a human tires. Eventually it was upon her, and grasped her round the waist with one of its truck-sized clawed hands, wrenching her up from the ground in front of its hooded and cloaked face and letting out another piercing shriek.

Kayla screamed as well, the hand around her tightening and crushing her midsection. Blood erupted from her mouth, muffling the scream, and the beast let out not an inhuman scream this time, but a very human sound indeed - a hateful cackle.

But in that moment Kayla finally freed her sword arm and drove it deep into the center boiling yellow eye of the thing. The cackle was gone, the painful shriek was back, and the beast fell backward against one of the stone buildings, its weight causing the small structure to completely collapse on top of it, the stones creating an avalanche that threatened to overtake her too.

Kayla turned on her heel to run, but the stones still enveloped her, and bashed into her head, back, legs, and midsection, sending her sprawling against the ground, all wind knocked out of her.

With shaking hands she pushed against the fallen stone that had pinned her left leg, but it would barely budge. She lay back against the cold, wet ground there for a moment, trying to figure her next move, battered and bloody as she was, and without her sword now too as it was lost beneath the stones and beast.

She looked upside-down down the distance of the street she was on. There it was, tall and grand,majestic and inhumanly structured as ever… the stone gate that had led into this labyrinthine hell to begin with. But the gate, once ajar though too large for any human to open, was now sealed tightly shut.

Kayla lay her head back down and sat silently for a moment.

In the distance came one… two… five… ten… dozens of raising cacophonous shrieks in the hazy blue undernight. Beasts come hunting fresh blood.
