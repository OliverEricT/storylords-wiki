	Greetings boys, GHOULS, and non-BOOnary, it is I - your host who is maybe some sort of ghost Ten Cent Price - The Loremaster! 
</p>
<p>
	As a quick note, none of what I say on this program is ever written down in advance, I simply ramble whatever comes to mind for the allotted two minutes then you get to watch your unlicensed public domain horse shit. So I’m TECHNICALLY not breaking the Writer’s Guild picket line so STOP EMAILING ME CALLING ME A SCAB! My assistant Derek is getting VERY upset about it. I’ve never read an e-mail.
</p>
<p>
	Tonight we peer inside of the Spookyvision scope or whatever and open on a small town situated quaintly in the mountains of Colorado - an everywheresville where the pallid skinned mark their homesteads and the darker folk are escorted away by militarized racists in blue uniforms. The kind of small town we’ve all experienced at one point or another because it’s romanticized by boring crackers HARD.
</p>
<p>
	Specifically we will meet Billy Green, a high school student for most of the year but a pool cleaner by the blazing heat of the summer months. He’s about to learn that one simple mistake can change a life forever… or end it completely.
</p>
<p>
	But it’s never quite that cut and dry… on Spookyvision (™, all rights reserved, copyright The Viacom Corporation, 2023)
</p>
<p>
	Billy Green, the kind of dude you’d see standing in the background of literally any polaroid of a party during the 90’s, stood beside the glistening clear blue pool, watching as the water hose slowly raised the water level bit by bit toward its final height. He sighed to himself, glancing up at the rippling hot sun in the sky above him which scorched the clouds that dare come close to it so that no respite could be found. The temperature had been floating around 95 (that’s like 30 or something Rich I don’t fucking know) for something like two weeks at this point and he was certain by now he’d burned every bit of his skin he was capable of showing publicly. 
</p>
<p>
	Perhaps the sun would burn his eyes less if he turned his baseball cap around forward to actually cover them from the onslaught, but the thought never really entered his brain. As a matter of fact, not a lot of thoughts entered his brain, pretty much ever. 
</p>
<p>
	“This blows…” Billy grumbled under his breath, glancing back at the McMansion of the family who had hired him to clean out their pool to begin with. The Darcy’s. The house was everything you’d hope to find in a shoddily constructed fake mansion in a suburb purchased by people too stupid rich to even care they were being fleeced and built by only the finest carpenters and electricians you could hire through Craigslist. 
</p>
<p>
	The Darcy’s were some kind of old money, but Billy wasn’t exactly sure of the story. He knew the father was a lawyer and the mother had some kind of totally legitimate business selling make-up or insurance or something? Oh yeah - a pyramid scheme. I mean MLM. 
</p>
<p>
	There was a little brother in grade school as well but Billy didn’t know anything about him. He thought maybe he’d heard something about him being the golden child and the heir apparent or something once? He couldn’t recall. His name was Berald, he tought. Berald? That couldn’t be right…
</p>
<p>
	Anyway, the real reason he’d taken this job at all, besides the $4.50 an hour it’d net him for Jolt Cola and weed, was Anna Darcy, the hottest girl in school. He’d had a crush on her for years at this point but she didn’t even know he existed. Not in like a modern day creep ass way but in a 90’s TV crush kinda way where we all just accepted that this was alright as long as it didn’t get too too weird. Honestly sometimes well beyond that depending on how hard the laugh track was going at the time.
</p>
<p>
	“Yo dude, are you daydreaming about Anna right outside her house, bro? Hahahahaha” a voice suddenly cracked his reverie and snapped him back to reality. He whipped his head around to be greeted by the dopey hanging expression of Tom “Dips” Johansen - his supposed best friend and the kid that the adults in town most often called “that dumb fucking burnout.”
</p>
<p>
	Dips was called that because he had the habit of stealing the various dips at parties and no one really knew why. When pressed on it, he’d simply say “It’s for my projects, brah” and no one would dare lodge a follow-up question. He was so chill and jovial that most people just looked past his eccentricities. 
</p>
<p>
	“You’re like three hours late, Dips. What the fuck were you even doing all afternoon?” Billy grumbled, shoving the hose into Dips’ hands forcefully and walking away, his flips flops flipping and flopping as they do the whole while.
</p>
<p>
	“Aw, chill, dude. I was just watching Cartoon Network, bro. Did you know they play Bugs Bunny cartoons like twenty-five seventeen for like the WHOLE month on there, dude? Fuckin’ mad funny, dude - especially when he dresses up like a lady bunny, dude. I’m like, in love then, you know?” Dips held the hose with a lazy grip, allowing it to droop down and continue to fill up the pool, though he wasn’t any the wiser about it. He was too focused on trying to adjust his wraparound shades with his other hand absently as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
	“You’re in love with Bugs Bunny?” Billy turned around with confusion written all over his face. He had picked up a large plastic tank of chlorine and was trying to lug it back to the pool but he’d been struck dumb by what this fucking guy had just said out loud to him, of his own free will.
</p>
<p>
	“Nah, bro, the lady bunnies, dude. That’s totally not the same thing, bro.” Dips, looked down at the pool and watched blankly as the water filled up past the fill mark and continued to rise, not even having a slight reaction to fucking up his job right before his own eyes. 
</p>
<p>
	“Fucking hell, Dips! Watch out!” Billy dropped the chlorine tank on the deck and ran across the yard toward the back of the house. He yanked the spigot closed on the hose as hard as he could, having to really put effort behind it to yank through the rust on the metal pieces. “You dumbass! You almost over-filled the pool daydreaming about fucking a cartoon rabbit!”
</p>
<p>
	“Whoa… alright, you’re right, dude. I’ll keep my unnatural proclivities to myself while on the job from now on, bro. I’m not trynna cause any trouble or anything just cause Lady Bugs got me bricked up, you know?” Dips wound the hose back in, slowly walking across the yard back toward the spigot as he drew the hose up and over his hand and then tucked it under his elbow.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s fine, it’s fine…” Billy walked past Dips back to the pool and picked up the chlorine tank once more, lugging it back over to the edge of the pool. “This shit weighs a ton for bein’ plastic…”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s not what the material is made out of that gives a tank it’s weight to mass ratio, bro - it’s the water weight of the soluble material within that creates the gravitational drag compared to our muscle mass and physical capability, you know? Shit’s pretty wild. “ Dips said with his trademark giant toothy smile.
</p>
<p>
	“...what?” Billy responded, completely dumbfounded that his idiot best friend just said something that sounded like what Urkel would say on the TV to teach those nerd bullies at the nerd college he went to a lesson for trying to haze him.
</p>
<p>
	At that moment, interrupting this scene that I’m writing that’s going absolutely nowhere, the back door to the McMansion flew open and from within emerged the most beautiful sight that Billy Green had ever seen in his entire life - Anna Darcy in a two-piece bikini. He was absolutely awestruck, and stood mesmerized and staring as she crossed the lawn back toward poolside.
</p>
<p>
	“Uh… hello?” her voice broke Billy from his second reverie of the day, his eyes shooting open with recognition. Anna looked pissed, but it just made her hotter for some reason? She groaned out at him, “When’s the pool gonna be ready to swim in, pool bitch?”
</p>
<p>
	“Pool bi—... uh, I’m Billy. Billy Green? We have fourth period Chemistry together? I sit right behind you in class? We were in the same lab group on every single lab we’ve had to do the entire semester? I pulled your dog out of that collapsed treehouse last summer? I gave you my kidney after that car accident freshman year?” As Billy listed off ways that Anna should recognize him and she stood completely stonefaced staring at him with no response he got more and more desperation in his voice with every new listing, until finally she held her hand up, one finger in the air, to shush him.
</p>
<p>
	“I didn’t ask for your life story, Jimmy. I asked you when the pool was gonna be ready.” she tutted.
</p>
<p>
	“Jimmy’s my twin brother with blonde hair, I’m actually Billy so–” Billy started again, but she shoved her finger into his mouth to shut him up. He should have been pretty pissed off, hurt, or offended by all of this, but he was mostly just psyched that she had touched his mouth. It was pretty pathetic, but he wouldn’t realize that until a girl touched his wiener later on.
</p>
<p>
	“POOL. WHEN SWIM? WHEN FINISHED?” Anna yelled out, frustration and disdain dripping from her every word.
</p>
<p>
	“Yo babe-a-saurus, chill out, bro.” Dips interrupted the situation, tilting his head like a dog would at Anna, “The pool’ll be ready like, an hour or so after we introduce the chlorine to the pool’s delicate ecosystem, dawg. That’s just science, bro.”
</p>
<p>
	“UGGHHHH! Why does daddy keep hiring these itinerant workers?! They don’t even understand plain ENGLISH!” Anna turned and stormed away back across the lawn toward the door.
</p>
<p>
	For his part, Billy had already unscrewed the top cap to the chlorine bottle and tilted it over to pour it’s contents carefully into the pool - but when Anna turned and walked away he was straight up mesmerized by ass and just let the entire container go. He googly-eyed like every teenager in a coming-of-age comedy ever has while the whole container fell into the pool and dunked under the water, spewing it’s chlorine out.
</p>
<p>
	“WHOA, DUDE!” Dips yelled out, charging over at full speed to try and catch the tank but it was far too little too late. He looked around frantically, noticed that Billy still hadn’t even registered what he’d just done, and slapped him directly in his face. “DUDE! WAKE UP! Time for buttcheeks later, bro! You made a fuckin’ HUGE uh-oh, dude!”
</p>
<p>
	“OW! What the fu–.. OH GOD!” Billy went through several emotions in a row within a couple seconds and then ran around to the side of the pool and grabbed the cleaning net from it’s storage amongst a couple beach umbrellas in a metal stand.
</p>
<p>
	The two of them grabbed onto the shaft (lol) of the pool cleaner and dunked it out into the water, scaling it down to the bottom of the pool and underneath the chlorine tank. Both of them winced as they realized how easy it was to drag the previously incredibly heavy tank back up from the bottom of the pool. They grabbed onto the sides of it and yanked it back up out of the water, desperately peering into it with hope in their hearts to find chlorine within – but there was nothing but a quarter of a tank of water.
</p>
<p>
	“That wasn’t… that isn’t a LOT of chlorine is it? Like it’s… it’s not like TOO much or…” Billy panicked, dropping the pool cleaner pole completely and yanking his backward ball cap off to grip at his dark brown hair. “We’re fine, right?”
</p>
<p>
	“NO, dude! We’re MASSIVELY fucked, bro. That tank was for EVERY pool we gotta clean today! We’ve got three more pools to go, dude! That was FOUR POOLS worth of the shit!” Dips dropped the haft as well and gripped Billy by the shoulders, trying to shake reality back into him. 
</p>
<p>
	“Oh fuck… oh god… uh…” Billy looked back over his shoulder toward the house in fear - and that fear was pretty instantly confirmed reality when his eyes locked with the face of Mr. Darcy standing in one of the back windows staring directly across the wide yard at the two of them, his form obscured mostly in darkness on the other side of the glass. 
</p>
<p>
	“Oh shit dude… do you think he knows, dude…? Are we like… already fucked THIS bad, dude?” Dips murmured out as quietly as he could, fearing even talking normally that Mr. Darcy could hear them from half a football field away in the back window.
</p>
<p>
	“No.. no! Just act natural, man! Let’s just collect our stuff and go! It’s not gonna cause any problem, dude. We’re good! We’re totally fine!” Billy began rushing around picking up their cleaning equipment, the empty chlorine tank, everything he could get his hands one and shoved some of it into Dips’ hands, pushing him out toward the side gate as hard as he could.
</p>
<p>
	“Are you frickin’ KIDDIN dude?! That shit is straight up poisonous to humans in that kinda concentration, dude! We gotta tell ‘em about it!” Dips scream-whispered his refusal to comply but was also just straight up complying and leaving at the same time. “If they get into that shit they’re gonna straight up Raiders of the Lost Ark their faces off, brah!”
</p>
<p>
	“Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Shut the fucking shut up!” Billy yell-screamed back as he pushed Dips out of the gate and shut it tightly behind them. He them shoved the chlorine tank as hard as he could into Dips’ arms, pushing him down the street away from him. “Go the fuck home, Dips! This didn’t happen, dude. The chlorine is gonna be mostly evaporated to the heat by the time anybody uses the pool. We’re FINE! I’m sure this kinda thing happens all the time.”
</p>
<p>
	“Uh… yeah… ok…” Dips answered unsteadily.
</p>
<p>
	“We’re fine, man. Just… just go home and play Bonk. I’ll see you tomorrow.” Billy said with more confidence in his voice now.  
</p>
<p>
	“I got Super Bonk now, dude. WAY cooler Bonk, my man.” Dips said with his normal chill smile returning to his face. He sat down his armful of equipment and waved to Billy before hefting it all back up and turning to head down the street home.
</p>
<p>
	Billy waited for Dips to leave and then walked back over to the fence. He reached as hard as he could to grasp onto the top of the split wooden lattice and hoisted himself up to take a peek over it. The overwhelming smell of chlorine hit his nostrils like a missile and almost caused him to lose his grip and fall, but he held fast and squinted his eyes through the pain - and the weird ass numbing of your entire face that happens with too much of the stuff - to peer back toward the back of the house again. 
</p>
<p>
	The window where Mr. Darcy stood was empty and dark now. Billy sighed to himself very lightly, and then dropped back down to the sidewalk and ran home as fast as his flip flops would let him. Even though the window had been empty the entire way back across town he could still feel Mr. Darcy’s eyes pierced the back of his skull.
</p>
<p>
	—-----------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	Billy flopped down face first in his bed, groaning out loud to himself. He’d blown his chance to meet Anna and get her to like him somehow (he’d never figured this part out but had just kinda hoped for the best). Even worse, he’d probably just caused her entire family grievous bodily harm. Even worse than THAT - her dad might know he’s the one responsible for it!
</p>
<p>
	“UGGHHHHHH!!” Billy groaned out even louder, burying his face in his pillow. 
</p>
<p>
	There was a silence to his house that seemed kind of unsettling, he finally noticed. He turned over on his back and listened carefully. His brother wasn’t practicing his Sousetsuken Karate in the next room - he couldn’t hear the heavy bag getting kicked at all. His little sister wasn’t screaming into a phone about how hot whatever member of N*Sync she loved was - this week it was Joey Fatone for some reason? Fuck if he knew. 
</p>
<p>
	He couldn’t even hear his mom and dad arguing over which one of them married down and which kid was gonna go with which of them when they finally got the balls to divorce. There wasn’t even the ear-splitting back and forth about the ‘revenge porn’ whatever that was. It was just completely silent. He felt a small chill go up his spine as he lay there.
</p>
<p>
	He felt the air go acrid against his nostrils suddenly. An all-too familiar smell filled the room around him to the brim and he couldn’t breathe any longer. The smell of chlorine threatened to choke him to death in his own room. He stood up, staggeringly, and grasped onto the window next to his bed, yanking it up and open as hard as he could. The smell didn’t dissipate at all - as a matter of fact, it got stronger. 
</p>
<p>
	He turned to run towards the door but was stopped in his tracks. From the crack between the door and the floor was slowly, steadily pouring water into the room which was pooling against the hardwood and even soaking into his rug at the center of the room as it poured out.
</p>
<p>
	Billy went to scream but he couldn’t - his lungs too full of the toxic chlorine to grasp air in for it. He backed up against the window and desperately tried to bring in air to his lungs, but none came. The door handle across the room started jiggling hard against its metal casings, turning against them with a loud, haunting squeal. 
</p>
<p>
	“NNNNOOOOOO!!” Billy screamed out, finally.
</p>
<p>
	“WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU SCREAMIN’ FOR?!” his dad screamed at him from the open door into the hallway. 
</p>
<p>
	Billy opened his eyes again and looked at the floor - finding not a single trace of water. As a matter of fact the chlorine smell was completely gone as well. All that was left was a dumbstruck middle aged construction worker in his underwear and a dirty tank top.
</p>
<p>
	“Uh…. don’t… don’t come in without knocking?” Billy sputtered out.
</p>
<p>
	“....you gotta be fuckin’ kidding me with… are you out of your mind? Your mom said go out and clean out the garage already! She’s been screamin’ at you to do that shit for weeks. And when she’s done screamin’ at you then she comes to scream at me. And I ain’t havin’ that shit. Least not til the papers go through.” Billy’s dad grumbled. 
</p>
<p>
	The two stared at each other for a second before Billy’s dad violently clapped his hands together, “GET A FUCKIN’ MOVE ON!”
</p>
<p>
	Billy hopped to it, grabbing his hat and quickly placing it on his head, backwards of course, before heading out to the garage.
</p>
<p>
	—---------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	Billy had lost a lot of hours of this fine summer day to cleaning out the garage and had even done a really half-assed job of it too, but it was over now. Evening had fallen on the quiet burg nestled in the mountains and Billy headed back into the house to get in a little Bonk before bed. Though he was kind of seething inside at the fact it wasn’t gonna be this great new Super Bonk he’d heard about.
</p>
<p>
	“That’s a damn shame…” his dad’s voice filtered from the living room as Billy headed towards the stairs. He stopped and peered in through the open doorway to the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
	His mother was crying softly and his father was shaking his head, both of them planted on the couch in the middle of the room staring at the gigantic 20 inch TV screen in front of them. 
</p>
<p>
	The screen was displaying the evening news, a white-haired swaggering puppet of a man with nothing behind his eyes, aka a newscaster, was giving a report about…. A dead teenage girl…
</p>
<p>
	“Tonight’s top story again, a teenage girl was found dead this evening in a pool in the Crescent Heights section of town.” the newscaster repeated, causing every muscle in Billy’s body to stiffen and grow cold. “Anna Darcy, age 16, was found dead face-down in her family’s pool today. Authorities have stated that the cause of death isn’t 100% confirmed at this point but they are looking at a suspect and will be bringing him in for questioning as soon as possible.”
</p>
<p>
	Billy stood transfixed, his eyes darting over and over the name Anna Darcy displayed on screen. His body shook so hard, his head pounded so loudly, his chest hurt so much he was certain he was going to die at any second. Spontaneously explode, or just simply cease to exist. But instead he bolted out the front door of the house, leaving it wide open in his wake.
</p>
<p>
	He was running, as fast as he could, against the evening sunset which still clung to the slightest bit of dark blue light in the air. Everything burned, everything hurt, and he wanted to scream but he was too scared. The police were looking for him. He was a murderer! He killed the only girl he’d ever loved!
</p>
<p>
	He didn’t know where he was going as he ran but twenty minutes later it all suddenly made sense. He was standing outside of Dips’ front door, panting and heaving at the marathon he’d just run just as hard as the violent fear and pain in every thread of his being.
</p>
<p>
	“D–..Dips…” he panted out, trying to scream to get his attention inside, but he couldn’t. He raised his arm weakly and began to beat on the door. Not a knock but a continuous slamming of his fist into it. No lights came on inside in response, the entire small house completely dim in the dusk of oncoming night. He leaned his entire body against the door, hands against it to prop himself up, his mind whirling and heaving against itself.
</p>
<p>
	Until he felt something strange on the other side of the door. Something pressed against it, pushing against it hard on the other side. Billy stumbled backwards, his mouth agape at what his eyes saw but his mind could not comprehend. The door WAS being pushed outward - like a cartoon - like nothing that could exist in real life. Distended and bubbled outward as if the force of an explosion was growing behind it, but in slow mouth. 
</p>
<p>
	Billy wanted to run but he had nothing left in the tank. He’d run the entire way across town and all he could do now was collapse onto the walkway, falling down onto his ass with all his weight the instant he tried to run.
</p>
<p>
	The door swelled, and his heart beat like a machine gun, and he tried to open his mouth to scream… but the numbing, nulling feeling in his face wouldn’t allow it. He hadn’t noticed it at first because he could hardly breath, but the smell had followed him. It had pre-empted him. It was behind the swelling wooden door which popped and splintered under the oncoming pressure. Chlorine. 
</p>
<p>
	Billy tried to crawl backwards away from the door but his hands found no purchase in the sopping wet grass on either side of walkway, doused in a bright, clear blue water which spouted out of the sides of the bulbous tumorous swelling of the door. There was no escaping this. There was no screaming for help for what he’d done.
</p>
<p>
	The door split. The deluge of chlorinated water overtook him like a tsunami, sweeping him up in it’s wave and threatening to rip him apart from its fury. His open eyes burned with a pain he had never felt in his entire life and his weakened arms and legs could not struggle against the onslaught as it slammed him across the ground, ripping his skin against the concrete below him. Tearing him apart limb from limb.
</p>
<p>
	But even then within the water he saw her. The silhouette of flowing hair and limp limbs caught up in the same explosive torrent of water, but incapable of fighting back. Not after what he had done to her. The body came closer, and closer, swept along waves beyond all control, but aimed. Aimed directly at him.
</p>
<p>
	Billy tried to push away, but had no limbs to do so, had lost everything he was before he became a murderer in the onslaught. The body of the girl swept up into his face, it’s hair engulfing him beneath the wave, its face inches from his own. It’s eyes exploding open to stare deeply into his own.
</p>
<p>
	“AAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!”
</p>
<p>
	“Dude! Dude!” a familiar voice shocked Billy back to reality all at once. He opened his burning eyes to stare where it had come from, and met the worried glance of Dips staring back down at him. “Are you tweakin’, bro?!”
</p>
<p>
	“D-Dips…! We killed her man…! We killed Anna! She’s dead! The chlorine! The chlorine!!” Billy screamed, struggling up to his feet and grasping onto Dips’ McDonalds work shirt, distending the collar of it. 
</p>
<p>
	“Yo…! Yo, calm down bro! Stop screaming, dude! Hold up!” Dips, grabbed onto Billy’s shoulders and shook him violently to stop him from screaming, which worked for the moment. “Everything’s simpatico dude…”
</p>
<p>
	“W…what?” Billy managed to hoarsly speak.
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah bro. WE didn’t kill Anna.” He said quite matter of factly, gripping Billy by his wrists and yanking them away from his collar violently. “YOU killed Anna. I didn’t do shit, bro.”
</p>
<p>
	“WHAT?” Billy screamed out, “You were there! You’re just as responsible as I am!!”
</p>
<p>
	“Nah, dude. You spilled the shit, man. You’re the one who threatened me to keep it a secret, brah. I wanted to tell ‘em about it and come clean, and cause you forced my hand, Anna’s dead now, dude. That’s fucked up, but it’s not MY fault you killed her.” Dips said with a coldness that chilled Billy to the bone. He shook his head though, “Don’t worry, brah. I’m not gonna narc or nothin’. But I’m not goin’ down with you when you do get caught, bro.”
</p>
<p>
	Dips walked past the stunned, silent Billy, up to his door. He took his keys out calmly and opened it, sliding behind the perfectly fine wooden door of his home. Right before he closed it, he leaned out and shook his head.
</p>
<p>
	“Damn shame you killed her too, brah. She was a total babeasurus.”
</p>
<p>
	And then the door shut. Leaving Billy standing in the suddenly cold night air, alone. 
</p>
<p>
	Eventually he turned and walked away. Back into town. He wasn’t running anymore, he was barely moving. The scent of chlorine in the air overwhelmed him, choked him, filled his lungs and head, but it didn’t push him onward any longer. He was trying to escape anymore.
</p>
<p>
	It was around 8pm by the time he had reached his destination. He stared up at the backlit sign for the police station which burned with an incessant halogen hum in the night. He shook, violently, as he opened the front doors but inside he was finally calm again. He was right where he belonged now. He would let the world know who had killed Anna Darcy. 
</p>
<p>
	Then maybe the smell would finally go away.
</p>
<p>
	—-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, we’re real sorry about all of this, Mr. Darcy.” the police officer said, shaking his head ruefully. 
</p>
<p>
	“It’s a tragedy… we’ll never get over it…” Mr. Darcy said solemnly, his head down.
</p>
<p>
	“Well, hopefully time will heal all wounds. And now we know who the real culprit is so some justice can be done.” The officer said, unfurling a key ring from his shitty little fascist utility belt. He leaned down and pushed a small key into the handcuffs around Mr. Darcy’s wrists, undoing them and letting him free. “Again, we’re real sorry about suspecting you of doing this heinous crime. It’s just how we go about investigating.”
</p>
<p>
	Mr. Darcy stood up, cradling one wrist then the other in a hand to relieve the pain of wearing them all day. He smiled a pained, half-hearted smile and nodding sympathetically. “I’ve seen Unsolved Mysteries, officer. I understand that when a family member is found hacked to pieces in a pool, floating face down with no limbs, then the absolute first candidate is another family member. Especially the father.”
</p>
<p>
	The officer nodded, but was somewhat perturbed by the ease at which Mr. Darcy had recounted his own daughter’s body being found mutilated in his pool. But he shook his head again, chalking it up to shock. “Yeah, exactly. The kid came in and admitted he killed her. He just kept saying it over and over and over again. I think the entire thing broke him, honestly.”
</p>
<p>
	“I can only imagine.” Mr. Darcy said, rubbing the bridge of his nose and then shaking his own head. “My wife and I are trying to find solace in the fact that my younger son is our heir now - who will see our family forward into the future. A Darcy man to continue a man’s legacy.” He smiled and nodded to the cop. “Good night, officer.”
</p>
<p>
	“Uh… goodnight, Mr. Darcy. If you need anything, just let us know, ok?” The officer walked around to the other side of Mr. Darcy and opened the front door, holding it for him as he walked out.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh uh, Mr. Darcy!” the cop called after him after a few steps. “Did you want us to send a clean-up crew? Some officers were complaining of an insane level of chlorine in that pool even after we drained, cleaned, and refilled it. It’s not safe at all and it absolutely stinks to high heavens.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh I can’t smell chlorine. Never could.” Mr. Darcy said with a smile.
</p>
<p>
	So was the smell of chlorine simply the guilt of what he had done bearing down upon Billy’s poor young soul? Were the fantastical things that he saw and experienced simply his mind’s way of dealing with the crushing desperation he felt to escape the consequences of his supposed crimes? Or was there something more at work to place Billy Green in a cell for the rest of his life for a crime he did not commit?

	Guilt is a powerful feeling that can consume us whole - devour our very being and spit out a shell of a person in return. Most of us deal with the crushing reality of guilt - we can smell the chlorine in the air - the smell of our own conscience burning in the acidity.

	Well… most of us.
