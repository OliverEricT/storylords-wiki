	New York, New York, Fall 1934. Entries 2 thru 4.
</p>
<p>
	Entry 2: Got hired by a local waitress to find out if her husband was cheating on her. He was. They always are. Funny story though, when the guy saw me through the window he lost his lid and threw the lady at me to get away faster. Guess he’ll have to find someone new to cheat WITH too.
</p>
<p>
	Entry 3: Somehow or another I got wrangled into a missing persons case. I hate those. A local low-level mafioso’s brother had gone missing down by the docks and he suspected foul play. Turns out he got shitfaced and bet the bartender down at the Rusty Spitoon that he could fuck a mermaid any time he liked. Went headfirst into the bay while floppin’ his dick around like a helicopter. Guess he thought it’d soften the landing? Either way he floated back to the surface after we prodded his body with pool cleaners. This is neither here nor there but I think the accent I picked up from the locals is getting worse. Worse? WORSE. God damnit.
</p>
<p>
	Entry 4: This ain’t much of a mystery to be real with you but shit did get absolutely buck-fucking-wild the other night so I figured a quick entry oughta be in order.
</p>
<p>
	I was puttering around the office, trying to get some paperwork done on the last case - y’know with the basement mummy and her virgin boyfriend? I was listening to the radio to help pass the time, enjoying myself for a change, especially cause it was a live broadcast of Cab Calloway and his Orchestra. But they barely got three bars into The Hi-De-Ho Man before the signal cut out entirely.
</p>
<p>
	Now you know me, always calm, cool and collected, - never killed a scientist’s entire family for crossin’ me once or anything -  so I was definitely not about to smash the holy shit out of my third radio this month when the speakers started playing some tone I didn’t recognize. I gotta admit, the sound was pretty entrancing for a moment - like the faint sound of a song you once loved in your youth playing down a hall, just out of earshot. The pure, unfiltered sound of nostalgia.
</p>
<p>
	There was something incredibly familiar about it, but I couldn’t place it for the life of me, if you’ll forgive the phrasing. Cause I’m dead as fuck. But just as quickly as it had started, the radio fizzled, shorted out, and fell silent. I looked the machine over with a careful eye, but I was never much on machinery during my first life, let alone the newfangled gizmos the kids had these days.
</p>
<p>
	These kids, man. I just don’t understand the next generation. The brats are always takin’ photographs of themselves - callin’ em whakadoo slang names like “self-portraiture” and postin’ on the local pinboards near bus stations. Doing these wild stunts for clout on telegraph party lines like writing scathing reviews of Alduous Huxley’s Brave New World and gettin’ em printed in the local newspaper for laughs or interviewing people on the street for time capsules to the future but just playing ‘would you rather’ about fucking celebrities. “Who’s hotter, Greta Garbo or Olivia Dehaveland? The year 2000 must know!” I just don’t get it.
</p>
<p>
	Aaaanyway, I didn’t pay it much mind and went back to working, now in the complete silence I typically try my best to avoid. That nagging little voice trying to make me pay up again for past sins and mistakes always tends to bubble back to the surface without a distraction to keep it submerged and I was never much of a listener. The dark memories swing back and forth from strangling innocent young women to death in the name of revenge all the way to telling the usher who told me to enjoy my movie “You too.” Shameful.
</p>
<p>
	Thankfully I didn’t have to stew in my own juices for too long but less than thankfully what brought me out of my pity party was a trash can smashing through the front window of my office, cracking into the hardwood of the waiting room and rolling into the empty receptionist's desk.
</p>
<p>
	“What the FUCK is goin’ on out there?!” I bellowed out in my usual eloquent manner, snatching up my overcoat and pistol holster from the coat wrack and slinging them on as I went out into the front office to investigate.
</p>
<p>
	I took note of the trash can alright but I was a little distracted by the writhing wall of human bodies pressed into the open jagged glass hole in the window, their arms and legs shoved inside and swiping around violently at the open air between us. Their flesh was being sliced and mangled by the broken glass but not one seemed to notice.
</p>
<p>
	Each of them had a completely vacant look in their eyes and their jaw hanging loose and open, slack from their skull with their tongues lolled out over their decrepit teeth. If the sagging yellowed flesh dangling from their faces, arms, and necks wasn’t the tip off then it would definitely be the smell of rot and decay they carried in with them - not a single one of these people was alive.
</p>
<p>
	“Fuckin’ ZOMBIES are real now?” I growled out between my teeth, reaching into my overcoat and unsheathing the .357 Magnum pistol within. I leveled it at the zombie in front’s forehead and held it steady, giving my best James Cagney impression like I knew what the fuck I was doing with a gun. I’ve always had  the aim of a blind man with a tremor in one hand and his dick in the other - and I never know which to fire first.
</p>
<p>
	The windowframe, being attached to a building I could afford to live in, gave way like tissue paper in a public bathroom and the deluge of corpses flooded into the room, rushing directly at me like flood waters. I managed to get off two shots before they overwhelmed me and the gun hit the floorboards beneath the shuffle of feet.
</p>
<p>
	They started biting into me and scratching at me with their little human fingers and I started to beat them off and not in the fun way - swinging wide punches into two or three of them at a time and sending them flying into the crowd, toppling over like dominoes. Jaws flew off of skulls, bodies flung through the air, inhuman caterwaulling filled the night.
</p>
<p>
	At the beginning my front office room looked like a Republican fundraiser with all the shambling corpses fiending for working class flesh but by the time I finished bashing the fuck out of all thirty or fourty of them it looked like a Republican fundraiser should be looking if there was any justice in the world - just a bunch of old white fuckers laid out (rest in piss to Mitch McConnell I hope by the time this comes out).
</p>
<p>
	I took a minute to take stock of my situation. The front office of my detective agency, such as it was, was now full of corpses I had no explanation for. Something was telling me that explaining to the police that they were already dead when they got here probably wasn’t gonna do much. And knowing the cops I’d have to be explaining this with several bullet holes in me already, which didn’t sound like much of a fun way to spend the evening. ACAB, fuck the police.
</p>
<p>
	“I was listening to Cab Calloway, damnit…” I whined to myself, taking a small moment of indulgence between episodes of my normal tough guy act.
</p>
<p>
	Just then something caught my ear. It was pretty instantly recognizable just from the intense feeling of nostalgia that welled within me - it was the signal from the radio from earlier. Let me take a second to explain something to you at home reading this later or having it read to you by an extremely handsome young man with a very large dick on a radio cast later perhaps - I don’t feel nostalgia. My entire life is a waking nightmare from inception til the very moment I’m writing this down and nothing was ever any better before - I didn’t even know what nostalgia felt like before the moment this radio signal hit my ears. Shit’s pretty fucked, is my point.
</p>
<p>
	I could have followed the distant sound on the wind as easy as any cartoon character floated after the smell of a delicious pie but I didn’t have to - it was much easier to follow the horde of shambling corpses that was parading down 42nd street toward the dim marquees of The Greystoke Museum. Men were filing in through the front doors like the draft office was opened up and someone had accused one of them of having a small dick. Which is the #1 recruiting tool in America, I’ve heard.
</p>
<p>
	I just followed along, shoving my pistol back into its holster, shoving my hands into my pockets, and blending in. Ironically I’ve never been in a crowd that I fit in with better, being a horrific amalgam of stitched-together corpses imbued with unholy life myself this looked as close to a family reunion as I was likely to ever get. Well, except for the fact I was two or three feet taller than any of them, anyway.
</p>
<p>
	Through the gigantic wooden double doors of the museum and through the atrium we went, all moving as one, as if being guided in lockstep. Even though it’s just down the road I’d never taken the time to visit this museum, it turns out they’ve got a pretty good collection. Just in the atrium alone we passed a gigantic Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton, several cases with battle axes, swords, and maces in them, a display of Inuit boats from the turn of the 18th century, and even an Egyptian sarcophagus which made me cringe instinctively.
</p>
<p>
	I made a mental note to visit during regular hours of operation if I survived the night. Make an afternoon of it.
</p>
<p>
	At the back of the atrium stood two gigantic sets of spiraling stairs which lead up to a pulpit-style balcony on their center, rising twenty feet off the ground above the floor.
</p>
<p>
	All of the zombies stopped abruptly in their lockstep, causing me to bump into one of them in front of me and sending it crashing to the floor. Just for a hot second, I felt the rush of being a normal dickhole school bully, shoving little guys into lockers and whatnot, but then felt bad about it and picked the undulating corpse up and sat it on its feet. For its part the zombie didn’t seem to take note of any of this.
</p>
<p>
	“And who… are you?” a booming deep voice filled the museum floor all around me. I shot my head up and saw instantly where it was coming from. A tall, dark-skinned man stood at the pulpit at the top of the stairs, white gloved hands pressed against the stone hand-railing. He was wearing a flowing black cloak around himself, and a fine suit beneath.
</p>
<p>
	“Uh… well you’re probably not gonna believe this but… Frankenstein.” I called back, feeling a little awkward yelling in this dead quiet museum. “The monster! Not the guy. You could probably ah… probably tell that, though.”
</p>
<p>
	“And why are you here, creature? To join my army of the undead?” the cloaked man called back down.
</p>
<p>
	“Uh. What?” I responded, looking around the room to see if anyone else was hearing this nutjob then feeling incredibly stupid remembering all these people were dead. “Not unless you offer one hell of a dental plan, boss.”
</p>
<p>
	“Mock me at your peril, creature. You are just as dead as these soldiers of my army and just as susceptible to my control.” The man leaned over the railing he stood against and I could finally make out his face for the first time - a distinguished black man in his late 40’s but the most obvious thing that caught my eye was an extended piece of silver-white machinery which had been somehow fused into the side of his head, bubbling skin lesions along the outer edge of the machinery the entire way around. The metal extended around one side of his face, obscuring one of his eyes save for a small slit.
</p>
<p>
	“What the fuck happened to your face?” I asked bluntly, pointing to the side of my face where the machinery would be on me.
</p>
<p>
	The man drew one white gloves hand over the side of the bulbous machinery and then smiled a rueful, hate-filled smile. “I was once merely a man… a scientist who could cure the ailments of mankind with the power of sound… of frequency… but what you see before you is the remnants of a man who was not allowed to be a scientist… who was relegated to the dustbin of history but for a fluke of birth! Now I am dead to this world and all who have wronged me will join me! I am The Phantom and my revenge will be neither quick, nor merciful.”
</p>
<p>
	“Uh… ok?” I managed to return, then motioned with my hand around the room at all of the less socially capable corpses around me. “And you’re gonna use the thing on your face to puppeteer all these ghouls out into the city and just start killin’ people all willy-nilly I bet.”
</p>
<p>
	“This.. ‘thing’ on my face, is my life’s work. It allows me to broadcast signals that can manipulate the molecular structure of human beings. I created it to cure cancer… to stop polio… but I was shunned by my so-called ‘peers’. They fused the device to my skin, to forever brand me a pretender - a quack. But now.. Somehow… Through some miracle it can control everything in a body… as long as there is nothing left to fight me, no spark of life to fight back against, I can puppeteer through this sound alone… And as for the fate of this city? None live who deserve to continue breathing after what they all did to me…”
</p>
<p>
	“Look, I’m really sympathetic to all the bad shit that happened to you, trust and believe, but the city’s fulla people who didn’t do any of that - people who never even met you. You’re just gonna overrun the whole burgh with zombies until nothing’s left? You’re really off your rocker, you know that?” I was never particularly good at talking down a criminal, I’m gonna be honest, and this wasn’t one of my more stellar attempts.
</p>
<p>
	“Farewell creature… rest easy knowing you are but the first to suffer for my indignity.” The Phantom crooned, waving a hand out over the crowd. “Kill him.”
</p>
<p>
	Every set of yellowed crusty eyes in the place besides my own turned right at me instantly. Their bodies lurches forward with nothing driving them except the acoustic hand up their ass, dragging limbs across the nice clean marble floors of the establishment without a hint of care about decorum.
</p>
<p>
	Hands latched onto my skin, grabbed at my overcoat, scratched at my shirt and pants - teeth gnashed at my flesh and the material of my clothing - hundreds of bodies piling up and over themselves for a chance to rip and tear at me, to devour everything about me they could get their hands on. But nothing actually penetrated my skin, or even left a mark.. It looked like a bunch of full grown toddlers teething on the world’s largest baby toy.
</p>
<p>
	I looked around at the crowd absently and then looked back up at the gentleman controlling them, “Yeah…uh… this doesn’t seem to be working out for you, champ. You wanna go ahead and turn yourself over or what?”
</p>
<p>
	“You underestimate the power of my Phantom Frequency. Allow me to demonstrate the true reach of my intangible hand.” The man waved his hand through the air again over the crowd, closing the one eye I could see and fiddling with a bunch of knobs and buttons all over the side of the apparatus burned into his skull. When he opened his eyes he smiled a rueful grin and allowed his cloak to flow back over his arms. Which looked really cool but didn’t seem to be doing much, as the crowd continued to gnaw at me like a college student on the frozen middle of a Hot Pocket.
</p>
<p>
	“You’re really just embarrassing yourself here. I gave you a clean out and you–” my great quipping got completely overtaken by the sudden shaking in the floor around me. It was so sudden and violent that I had to take a second to catch my footing - and most of my zombie hangers-on fell to the floor like a bunch of discarded clothing right before the magic starts, or so I’ve read. “ What the…?”
</p>
<p>
	The unmistakable sound of stone rattling and being dragged across stone filled the hallway like a symphony orchestra was playing a packed-house concert directly on top of my ear drums. I turned on my heels, sending another couple zombies flying to the floor, only to see exactly what, I gotta admit, I never thought I’d see in a billion years or more, if you’ll forgive the irony of that statement.
</p>
<p>
	Standing fourteen feet over top of me and looming as much of a shadow as it could with just the bare structure of a body - was the fossilized remains of a fucking Tyranosaurus Rex. Now I hear you reading this already and no, I’m not fucking shitting you here, that’s exactly what happened.
</p>
<p>
	The thing was shaking and shambling as it only had the metallic wiring ligature that once held it in place as a musculature, but it leaned down toward me and let out a very real, very un-fossilized screeching roar which sent the entire group of corpses that had been dangling from my neck like Mr. T’s chains scurrying away into the shadows at the corner of my peripheral vision. Somehow I wasn’t too worried about them in the moment anymore.
</p>
<p>
	The gigantic jagged toothy maw of the skeletal beast rushed at me like the 7 train and hit just as hard, smashing me down into the marble and sending it splintering into the air like rotted old wood. I was feeling every dead nerve in my body sudden spark back to incredibly painful life when the thing drew it’s gigantic jaws open and gnashed them down onto my torso like I was a fucking beggin strip.
</p>
<p>
	I let out a hell of a scream as it lifted me back up into the air and let me be the first to tell you after spending so much time bragging about how the zombies couldn’t bite into me, this fucking thing had absolutely no problem with it. I could feel the tips of its teeth meeting near my spine as it gnashed into me. I wasn’t riding high at the moment, is my point.
</p>
<p>
	The Phantom, for his part, was monologuing about something but fuck if I heard a single world of it. I was balling up both of my fists together and smashing them down into the fossilized snout of a god damn pre-historic thunderlizard, I suddenly couldn’t give a fuck less about the circumstances of his traumatic childhood. You’ll have to forgive me for my callousness.
</p>
<p>
	I could feel the stone splintering and rending under my blows but I was too close to the center of it, it was going to take a dozen more strikes before I could even break off one piece of this thing and it was gonna take way less time for the T-Rex’s massive incisors to chew me into tobacco paste ready for the gigantic smoking pipe I assume he took after dinner.
</p>
<p>
	The monster slammed it’s snout into the wall and dragged me across a bunch of Rembrandt paintings I’m sure weren’t priceless beyond all compare and then began shaking me back and forth in the air like a dog’s chew toy. Two times a chew toy that night, man. I told you it got buckwild.
</p>
<p>
	Anyway, I managed to hold onto the side of its face bones long enough to dig into my overcoat and retrieve my not-at-all-overcompensating gigantic pistol. Like I said earlier, I normally can’t hit the broad side of a barn with this thing but I was feeling lucky that night, naturally, and so leveled it as best I could.
</p>
<p>
	“FUCK!” I screamed out in pain again as I pulled the trigger three times, trying my best to win out with numbers if I couldn’t with skill.
</p>
<p>
	The first bullet shattered a priceless Ming vase which had just arrived at the museum yesterday and had a brand new bronze plate donated by a wealthy philanthropist from the Dusk Corporation by the name of Adrian Deville. I’ll explain later on why I know all that now, but this isn’t really the entry for that.
</p>
<p>
	The second shot hit the stone guard-rail that The Phantom had been leaning against this entire time, monologuing like a penny dreadful villain about something or other. He drew back from the strike, but was completely unharmed by it.
</p>
<p>
	The third bullet struck a Grecian bronze shield with a scene of Achilles fighting against Hector emblazoned upon it, pock-marking the surface and then ricocheting off of it straight across the room and into the side of The Phantom’s head apparatus, sending a shower of sparks into the air and causing him to recoil to the floor, screaming in agony.
</p>
<p>
	Now you might be at the point in this story where you’ve thought through this situation a little bit better than I had at that moment. Congratulations on your working brain that wasn’t dug out of a grave and stitched into a patchwork corpse body, must be nice. I’ve never thought ahead to see the consequences of my actions in my life and I think you all know that.
</p>
<p>
	The gigantic T-Rex skeleton immediately, the instant the sparks shot from the device, began to collapse in on itself - which was unfortunate news for me since I was wedged pretty god damn tightly between his third and forth incisor. If you’ve never felt the weight of a five thousand pound dinosaur skeleton collapse on top of you like a jenga castle then I can’t say I recommend it much.
</p>
<p>
	I can’t really tell you how long I was unconscious underneath those big ass bones but I can tell you it took me about twenty five minutes to dig myself out from under them. Not for nothin but most of my innards were outers at that point, so I wouldn’t be casting judgment on my physical fitness.
</p>
<p>
	By the time I’d dragged myself out of that pile of pick-up sticks, the entire floor of the building was littered with un-puppeteered corpses. It’s wild how quickly a zombie invasion can transform into a serial killer’s stash of bodies, isn’t it? I worked my way slowly but bleedingly through the room full of splayed out bodies and up the twisting stairs to the pulpit landing in the middle of them, expecting fully well to see the corpse of The Phantom curled up in the fetal position waiting for me to toss in a dumpster like I usually do but…
</p>
<p>
	The only thing sitting on that pulpit floor was the white metal casing that had gone around the machinery on his head. Stray wires, cut at the ends and still slightly sparking from time to time hung loosely from the inside of it, and screws splayed across the floor covered in rapidly drying blood. Around the edges of the casing was a mixture of dried blood, warped bits of flesh, and new fresh blood which dappled the ground underneath it.
</p>
<p>
	I’m usually a pretty decisive guy but I was at a bit of a loss right then. This guy had paid a pretty steep price in pain to get away but he did leave me holding the bag in a pretty big way. I decided it was best not to stick around and try explaining to the cops how I totally didn’t murder and maim dozens upon dozens of people and then take their bodies to a museum night for a fun family getaway - so I ditched pretty immediately.
</p>
<p>
	Back at the office I hung up a trash bag over the broken window and duct taped it in place - of course AFTER I pushed all my organs and whatnot back into my tum and duct taped those into place. I felt a bit of a kinship with the window after that one. I was grateful for the big janitor’s push broom I’d found in the alley a couple weeks earlier - it made it much easier to sweep all the corpses out of the office and onto the front street near the fire hydrant. The trash guys picked up whatever you leave there on Tuesdays so I should be good.
</p>
<p>
	Now I know I probably should be out there trying to find out where this nutjob is with his Radio of Death or whatever he called it, but no one is gonna be paying me to do that and I’ve got bills, like always. And now a window to replace.
</p>
<p>
	The moral of the story this time is to mind your own god damn business, even if life is trying to force you into somebody else's. You’ll be way happier in the long run.
</p>
<p>
	I gotta get a new radio, man… I missed the entire Cab Calloway concert too. Damn.
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
