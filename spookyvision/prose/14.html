Prompts: Shields & Curses

By Jeff Pennington

In the darkness there was a small, round table, under a white hot spotlight. Three chairs sat, flanking around the table, empty and wanting.

Cautiously Kayla S. Hunter walked into the light, shielding her eyes against it but for a moment. She squinted hard but she couldn’t see where the light was coming from. It burned into her retinas and she looked away, back toward the table setting laid out before her. But it wasn’t empty any longer.

Seated across from where she stood was a doughy man with jowls and the perpetual look of a hangover wearing a crumpled old overcoat with a piano key tie. The kind of tie that novelty shops used to sell back in the 80’s. She immediately recognized him as the moron who had come to her a while back to aid him with his bad dreams. He had smelled like cheese then and he smelled like cheese now - not like cheddar or havarti or something but like those little cheese squares in Lunchables. It made Kayla feel both repulsed and nostalgic all at once.

Pavlov Flinch.

“What in the fuck of shit are you doing here?” Kayla burst out, placing her hands down on the table and leaning across it to glower directly into his beady, deep-set eyes.

Flinch slowly surveyed the claustrophobic darkness around them then turned his sleepy gaze back to her. “I don’t even know where here is… The last thing I remember happening is falling asleep on the Johnson’s basement couch. Made it in without even waking up the dog this time. Had to use the last of my mom’s sleepytime pills last go.”

“What?” Kayla said, but then thought better of it and moved on.

“This place is… it’s…” she paused for a moment. She had absolutely no idea what this place was. Or how she’d managed to end up here. She couldn’t quite make out the last place she’d been in her memory either. She was in her office, right?

“Wait, we worked together before on a case, right? If so, no refunds under any circumstance, read the fine print under the lawn company ad on the other side of the card - that all counts for both businesses!” Flinch snapped, searching the pockets of his coat for something and coming up with nothing. “Damn, did I finish that cottage cheese already? The ziploc was right here…”

“I guess it turns out God does make mistakes.” Kayla muttered to herself, looking under the chairs and circling the table. She was looking for any kind of clue about what this even was. “Yeah, we worked together a while ago. The summoning in Huntington, West Virginia.”

“Y’know what, I just realized something. I didn’t piss myself!” Flinch exclaimed, like a revelation had come to him.

Kayla turned to look at him, her brows knotted and mouth agape. She couldn’t even find the energy to verbally question him.

“No, I mean…” Flinch stood up and fanned at his crotch, pulling on the fabric of his slacks to show it better. “There’s nary a whiff of piss! That means this must be a dream! Cause in the waking world, lemme tell ya…”

“No.” Kayla held her hand up sternly. “Let’s move on. It’s a dream, cool, that makes sense. What the hell are you doing here though? I don’t dream about piss-soaked reprobates all that often.”

“Hey! No piss! Not any piss!” Flinch returned, offended.

Suddenly Flinch slowly faded backward into the darkness, without even a reaction to what was happening, the vision of his form breaking apart into slowly wafting particles of black smoke that eventually blended into the darkness around the table. Kayla lurched forward with her hand out to stop it from happening but it seemed to be just beyond her grasp. She clenched her hand at the edge of the light and drew it back. It didn’t even smell like lunchables cheese anymore.

When she turned her eyes back to the table, sitting on it in front of the third chair was a pair of circle rimmed sunglasses with scarlet red lenses in them, neatly folded and facing toward her.

She took a step back away from the table, the faint recollection of having seen those sunglasses before dancing just at the periphery of her memory.

“I suppose we made a mistake inviting him. He doesn’t seem to have anything to do with this.” A familiar even toned voice filtered from nowhere and everywhere all at once.

“Wh…who is this? Where is this? What do you want from me?!” Kayla began to feel panic welling up inside of her that she could barely control, like something was crushing her lungs and the air was running out, though she couldn’t understand why.

“What do we want from you…? Well… I suppose… a resume and cover letter would suffice. Double spaced with at least three professional recommendations.” the voice boomed out over the darkness once more, though subtle, friendly, and even-keeled in tone. “After all, it seems you’re dead set on doing our jobs for us.”

“Wuh…where… why… I can’t… I can’t breathe…” Kayla wheezed out, struggling to stand even propping herself against a chair.

“Oh, I see… this was a bad time for an interview. You take care of your business… we’ll be watching.”

The voice faded away. The burning hot white spotlight clicked off. Even in the darkest, bleakest nothing she was now gasping for breath in she could feel everything moving away from her so very fast. Or maybe she was the one moving… falling… away

“HUGGHHH!” She gasped, lurching her head up off the hard stone ground and coughing and sputtering blood into the air. She convulsed hard against whatever was pinning her down but couldn’t move her upper body or her legs at all. She began to scream but then stopped, the memories of where she actually was, in the waking world, flooding back into her.

She was several miles below third avenue in Huntington, West Virginia. Inside of some massive, underground stone city - ancient beyond all measure - that the mayor had called Exzenchelleft. Oh fuck, that was right too - the mayor of Huntington, John T. Billiams, was part of the Acolytes of the Third Birth. The same cult that had almost summoned some horrific, immeasurably gigantic eldritch thing during the blood moon ritual.

She had almost gotten away, but one of the yellow-eyed beasts that Billiams had sent to kill her had smashed into one of the old structures that made up the subterranean city and collapses it - directly on top of her. Burying not only her, but also her only weapon against any of this, her silver sword cane.

Now she lay on the cold, wet floor of the vast cave that this city was built into, staring down the hazy blue miasma-lit streets, waiting for the weight of the stones to crush her completely once a bit more of the building collapsed down on her. She fluttered in and out of a haze herself, her vision swaying, having trouble steadying against the strange unreal light that permeated the air here.

But the sound of water running in the distance and the strange melodic hum that lingered in the air was soon overtaken by a much more familiar, much more dangerous sound - footsteps in the distance. Unhurried, even, light footsteps against stone.

Kayla tried to focus her eyes as best she could, but the pure black shadow these footsteps belonged to was upon her before she could push through the seering, crushing pain atop her to focus.

It stood there motionlessly for only a moment, its hand resting on top of its head, staring down at her with quizzical body language. Then it removed its hand, allowing its head to limply sad over to its left shoulder and sag down against it, the spinal bone jutting against the skin on the other side of the neck. Kayla wanted to scream but there was no longer any air in her lungs. She was going to die either way within the minute, it didn’t matter anymore what this horror did to her.

THUD! THUD! THUD! BOOM!

She felt her body rocking with every loud bashing noise, but no pain burned at her senses besides what she already felt, her whole body rocking underneath the jagged rubble that pinned her until suddenly… it wasn’t on top of her any longer.

She hacked and coughed and gasped and wheezed and rolled over onto her side against the cold hard ground, holding her ribs which were wracked with a stabbing pain that alerted every sense in her that something was horrifically wrong internally. But she wasn’t trapped any longer, even her legs capable of pained slow movement as she curled them up against her.

Through the desperate attempt to get air back into her lungs she looked up at the darkened figure who had freed her from her soon-to-be eternal prison, her eyes blearily narrowing to try and glimpse the creature's face in the shadow.

“So does this mean I’m not gonna get my credits this semester?”

Kayla spit blood onto the ground half out of necessity and half out of a genuine fucking spit-take. Myrtle Smellie stood in front of her, blood-soaked and holding her head upright on her shoulders with one hand. She smiled, blood-red teeth in her mouth foaming at the edges from the effort.

“Look, I didn’t even wanna sacrifice you to the Umbralborn, I just wanted to get into local politics,” Myrtle said demurely, kicking at small loose rocks on the ground, “ So like -how about we just forget that I brought you here to gut you and remove your guts and then hang your guts up on some spires and then chant to your guts and the immolate your guts in holy fire, and then take your guts and–”

“Ghhhyeah, alright.. Alright…” Kayla held up a hand to stop her. Her other hand was tucked under her left ribs, trying to hold them in place as best she could as she struggled up to one foot and one knee. She wobbled back and forth pretty heavily even during that. “How.. in the fuck.. Of shit… did you survive? Your neck is broker than half the teaching staff at Marshall…”

Myrtle thought for a second and then moved her hand, letting her head slump down against her shoulder and bob back and forth over it again. With her hands she began to count fingers, muttering to herself as she did. “I did… four… no five….six… seven rituals of ascendance to leave my humanity behind and become an angel. I just need four more and I can hear the eternal melody of God and ascend to become a true Angel!” She gripped her own hair and yanked it back up to its normal spot. “Ow.”

“I don’t know what the fuck any of that means but cool…” Kayla said, pushing herself up shakily to her feet finally, using the rubble that lay all over the street to balance herself. “If you can get me out of here I’ll give you the credit right fucking now.”

“Oh, that’ll be SUPER EAAASSSYYY!” Myrtle threw up the devil horns and began to headbang - very easily I might add - with her grip in her hair yanking her head back and forth.

“ALIVE!” Kayla interjected, holding up a hand to stop her yet again. “You gotta get me out of here ALIVE to get the credit.”

“Oh…” Myrtle stopped headbanging. “Well shit.”

Myrtle stood there thinking for a moment, holding her head in place with one hand and rubbing her chin with the other. Blood was literally pouring out of her in several places and had started pooling on the ground around her crocs.

Kayla looked around pointedly, trying to figure out any way of escape - preferably without a bobbleheaded zombie that tried to sacrifice her in tow. But this place was sprawling out in every direction, and the gigantic stone gate they had entered originally was shut tightly behind them - the bars not even big enough for a child to squeeze through them - and strangely barbed at that to maim anyone who tried.

“Ok, follow me!” Myrtle turned and zoomed away, skipping like a schoolgirl over the rubble and the twin downed beastial bodies that flanked the streets on either side.

Kayla winced… but followed suit, dragging one of her legs behind her though neither of them felt up to the task of taking the lead. She couldn’t help but notice that she was also trailing some blood.

Myrtle lead her down a long stone street and up an alleyway before running straight through the gigantic open doorway of a massively tall and long structure with a strange looping symbol etched on the front of it - where a cross might be on a monastery. It was obvious even from the outside what this building was - but as Kayla limped her way into it the truth of the matter became inescapable. This was some kind of ancient church.

The elongated building had struts and rafters of stone at the top of it that looked eerily like a ribcage inside of some mammoth beached whale that had rotted in the sun, detritus dangling from the stone from untold years of soot and soil and earth falling down into it from the patchy stone roof above. A single, lengthy walkway spanning the entire length of the structure - flanked on both sides by wide, short stone pillars - hundreds of them, lined up perfectly in geometric rows. Seats? Pews? It boggled her mind.

Myrtle stopped at the deus at the front of this ancient stone mockery of theism. She swept her arms up in the air at the obelisk in the center of the deus, which reached so high to almost touch the ceiling of the place.

“Ta-daaaa!!” she yelled, her head falling back over her shoulders and dully slapping into her upper back. “Ow.”

“I don’t even know what to say about this shit anymore…” Kayla muttered half under her breath, making the distance up between them as fast as she could.

The obelisk was perfectly white marble except for what adorned the front of it, just at human height. A perfectly round silver shield, forged with a spiral pattern on the front of it in a style she had never seen in her entire life. Kayla S. Hunter had studied antiquities, especially weapons, since finding out the Silverblood Society seemed to use them exclusively - the tall man used a longsword of some kind, the giant hairy guy had an axe, and the little one that never shut up carried a sickle. All of them made of pure silver. She knew everything about how weapons were made, how armor was made, how shields were made. But everything about this shield defied explanation.

She reached for it for a moment before drawing her hands back away from it. This close she finally noticed that the spirals were actually connected at points all over - creating what looked somewhat akin to a children’s pen maze - but at its center was a toothy mouth, agape, with two tongues sloughing out of it on either side. Something about that chilled her deeply - to her very bones.

“It’s a shield, you gotta grab it on the other side or it don’t work!” Myrtle yelled, her Screech from Saved by the Bell but a girl voice echoing a hundred times over off the walls of this place.

“Shut the FUCK up, you little dead FUCK! You’re gonna get us killed or sacrificed or what the fuck ever you people do in your old ass stone city!” Kayla snapped.

“Oh they already started their sacrifice after you got away. Westmoreland brought some babysitter he didn’t want his wife to know about - AGAIN. But this time they actually decided to use her in the sacrifice. They’re probably like five or ten minutes away from it by now.” Myrtle said sagely, nodding her own head with her hand. “Ow.”

“Wait, the sacrifice to do what?” Kayla said, snatching the silver shield off the wall and hoisting it down. She turned it around to look at the other side and noted how weirdly it seemed to be made on this side as well. Like a hand was meant to fit into it maybe? But it would have to be a huge fucking hand - like maybe Kareem Abdul-Jabbar could fit it, but that’s it. Yao Ming maybe, he was big. Why the fuck was she thinking about basketball right now?!

“Oh the Acolytes figured that this city was special or something - like attached to the Fallen Angels that we - uh well… they, not me anymore of course, I’m on the straight and narrow now, boss!” Myrtle smiled widely, the squeezing of her cheeks into the grin causing blood to spurt out the sides of her bared teeth. “That THEY worship. They think this is the Silver City that the angels founded when they fell and there’s a sacrificing circle in the center of the city so they’re gonna try to bring forth the Umbralborn again. They’re gonna TOTALLY beef it though.”

“Oh god… fucking shit, this is…wait. They’re gonna… beef it?” Kayla shot to attention.

“Yeah, I mean like, look at the symbology. Like, check it… “ Myrtle bent down to the ground and with her free hand began to move to the wet dirt on the floor around with one finger. She drew the strange eye shape that all of the Acolytes wore on their hoods first. “See? This is the symbol the Acolytes were founded on, right? This is like… the Umbralborn sigil or something, maybe. I dunno I was only half paying attention.”

Kayla could feel her blood pressure rising but continued to listen.

“So have you seen that symbol anywhere down here? NOPE! Not even once! These dumdums didn’t even care. This place is chock full of that weird old script that none of us can read and they’re gonna try to summon an eldritch being down here without even figuring out WHY none of it lines up. HAW!”

“...then why the fuck were you HELPING THEM THEN if you thought everything was gonna blow up in their faces?!” Kayla screamed, her own voice echoing off the walls of the great stone church.

“Well y’see Ms. Hunter, I’m a JOINER, a team player kinda person, I’m not the quarterback but I got a lot of school spirit, you know? It’s like–”

“SHUT UP! SHUT THE MOUTH! SHUT THE MOUTH!” Kayla screamed, jury-rigging the strapping of the silver shield onto her arm. She pulled it tight and felt it against her skin for the first time - for some reason it didn’t feel like normal leather. It felt familiar though… in a way that really unsettled her for some reason. She shook it off quickly, though, “Look, we’re getting the fuck out of here. I have no idea what the hell is about to happen but I’m in no shape to stop it this time. I’m dipping. Where the fuck is the exit?”

“Uh the big giant stone gate we were just at is the only entrance or exit I’ve ever used.” Myrtle said sheepishly, maybe actually feeling a non-cartoon emotion for once.

“God damn it…” Kayla grumbled under her breath. But didn’t have much of a moment to think after.

The ground beneath them began to shake, at first only a little but growing more and more violent by the second. Kayla and Myrtle wobbled against the seismic current, trying their damndest to stay on their feet. Everything around them was shaking, but nothing was falling apart - almost as if it was built specifically to be able to withstand this.

As well as she could manage Kayla pressed against the current beneath the ground and limped out into the street once more. The wind howled around her body, dragging the once limp glowing blue miasma in the air in a spiral toward the very center of the city - the endless ziggurat which she had only been upon the precipice of before. Her jaw was agape and eyes wide at the vision that lay before her.

Around the edges of the ziggurat, incalculably immense, decrepit, eroded ancient spires made of flesh and exposed bone began to slither up the sides, like a dead man’s hand grasping a trinket from beyond the grave. From the top of the ziggurat spires of purple and blue light fired off into the caves, each of them focusing on a sigil carved into the stone of the city, the walls of the cave around it, or the streets themselves and illuminating it. Each shape that the brilliant light landed upon lit up inside in response and the violent shaking of the ground grew even stronger.

Myrtle stood beside her now, watching through her broken coke-bottle lenses at what was unfolding before them. “WATCH OUT!!” she screamed, pointing at the light flecking off the top of the ziggurat and speeding toward them up the street. Just behind them, at the corner of their vision, a faint, hazy purple glow arose in one of the zig-zag symbols etched into the ground where the light was meant to meet.

But Kayla, spurred on by an understanding that seemingly put her at calm and drove the pain from her bones for but a moment, didn’t move out of the way of the oncoming light in the same way her weird loose-headed nerd companion did. Instead, he raised the etched silver shield in into the air in front of her, and jerked it sideways.

The light struck the shield and the angle at which the reflective silver was turned caused it to splinter off - directly through the immense open doorway of the stone church they were just standing within. Down the walkway, past the pews, unto the deus where the white marble obelisk stood.

The light struck the obelisk and a sound unlike any that any human being alive or dead had ever heard rang out like a clarion bell within the domed cave confines of this ancient and sacrosanct place. To call it a sound would be to misunderstand… because everyone who heard it that day, Kayla, Myrtle, the mayor, whoever else may have been within that city at that moment would tell you… it was a voice. A voice beyond human understanding. And it was screaming.

Suddenly the light above the ziggurat was gone. The thin incandescent blue miasma filtered back into the streets, into the heights of the cave, everywhere it had lit once before. Kayla’s eyes focused, at first bleary against the change, and saw that where there were once pillars of unspeakable flesh and horror… there was now nothing. The trill humming that filled the air before was even gone now - the city silent enough that even at this distance from the ziggurat she could hear the sound of human voices screaming in confusion and anger. She heard her voice once or twice even. Maybe it was finally time to go.

She turned the shield over in her hands, the front of it was scorched down the metal - the image of the labyrinth and the horrid mouth at its center barely raised and visible from the burning it had received. But the shield was no less brilliantly silver - reflecting every bit of light it caught.

“The gate!” Myrtle yelled, pointing with the hand that had been holding her head up, causing it to flop against her chest. “Ow.”

Kayla turned to see the gigantic stone gate stood slightly ajar, exactly as it had when they had arrived to this hellish place. She took off at a limping jog instantly, not even waiting for explanations or even to see if Myrtle was coming with her.

The sound of a head flopping around creaking and slapping against skin behind her let her know even before the chorus of “Ow. Ow. Ow.” hit her ears. She didn’t really care either way, the thoughts of logistics and explanations would have to wait. She wasn’t going to spend another minute here.

You wouldn’t believe how quickly two horrifically maimed women can run up a hundred stone steps when they’re REALLY motivated. Before you could imagine it, both Kayla and Myrtle stood at the top of those stairs, at the mouth of the cave tunnel that led them here to begin with. They looked back down at the stone city for just a moment, watching the wispy blue lights sway like water over the streets and spires as far as they could see. There was a strange, hypnotizing beauty to it.

“So… fuck this place, right?” Myrtle said

“Oh yeah. Fuck this place right up the ass.” Kayla responded.

And the two of them limped into the darkness of the tunnel, disappearing beyond the sight of any who would follow.

—---------------

The entire way back Kayla S. Hunter had been trying to figure out what the hell they were going to tell the student security guard at the top of Morrow Library Stacks. The two of them were absolutely covered in blood, carrying a medieval silver shield, and Myrtle’s head was only being held on by muscles, skin, and a prayer at this point.

She had been thinking of that and only that even over the endless cavalcade of excuses and apologies from Myrtle. She had started out explaining that they had kidnapped her as a child and brainwashed her like the end of A Clockwork Orange but with like…culty videos and whatnot, but she gave up on that one pretty quick. Then they had her parents locked up in a cell somewhere and were forcing her, but then she remembered she’d have to go save them at some point and dropped that one too. By the time they were back on the first floor she had settled on them making her dog into an antichrist and he was the one telling her to do all this evil stuff like sacrifice her nice new boss.

“That was the Son of Sam.” Kayla had reminded her, plainly, not even caring about the excuse at this point.

“There could be two Son of Samses!” Myrtle rebutted, frustrated.

The double doors that lead back out of Morrow Stacks stood before them. Kayla hesitated a moment and took a deep breath. She still had no idea what to say, but guessed that winging it was better than trying to snatch their IDs back and running away. She pushed the doors open and stepped through back into the fluorescent overhead lights of what counts as civilization these days and…

There was no one there. The desk chair sat motionless and empty behind the table. She jerked her head up to look at the security cameras above them and they hung limp, the red recording light dim.

“Uh… Ms. Hunter?” Myrtle said without her normal level of enthusiasm, pointing to the large wooden desk itself.

Setting in the center of the desk were their two IDs, face up and awaiting them. And far more inexplicably, laying across the table between them was a battered but in-tact silver cane sword, sheathed in its half-twisted cane scabbard. It was hers alright, but she had absolutely not a single clue how the fuck it could have gotten there from beneath the rubble so far below.

“...How could–” Kayla’s voice was cut off by the phone sitting on the other side of the desk suddenly ringing, loud enough to startle both of them, and make Myrtle take a step back away from it in fear.

The two of them looked at each other for a moment, the phone ringing more insistently with each chime. Kayla reached across the desk and picked it up, weakly bringing it across to her ear. “Hello…?”

“Ms. Hunter, thank you for taking care of that little incident in town for us.” a familiar voice came through crackling static into her ear, sending a violent chill down her spine that caused every bit of pain she’d been ignoring to come back to her all at once. “We thought it would only be polite to return what you’d lost.”

“Look, I don–”

“We’ll be in touch.” the voice cut her off, and the line went completely dead.

There was a long moment of silence before Kayla reached across the desk and hung the phone up.

“Who was it?” Myrtle said cheerily, her red-stained toothy grin returning.

“Jesus christ…” Kayla exhaled, looking at the broken abomination of a person standing in front of her.

“Oh cool, what’d he want?”

THE END

For real. That joke is the end. I never said I was a good writer.
