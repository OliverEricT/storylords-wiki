The Prodigal Son

Prompts: Serpents & Cards

By Jeff Pennington


It has been one month since the disappearance of three middle school children between Kirby and Whitesville Connecticut. Becka Washington, band geek weirdo and majorette virtuouso; “Wild” Willie Coltrane, the most dangerous kid in the school but only to himself; and Archie Grace, all-american honkey and captain of the middle school baseball team. Now two out of three of these kids were white so you would imagine there would be a nationwide manhunt on for their whereabouts - but you would be mistaken.


The police had assured the people of Kirby that they were doing everything they could, but it only took someone with working eyes in their head to see them parked outside of the Wawa sucking down stale coffee and shoveling donuts into their gaping gelatinous maws like their jobs depended on it - which was laughable in and of itself because their jobs didn’t even depend on not killing people, let alone donut intake - but it still seemed that way. 


As a matter of fact, they shut down the road out of Kirby that led the few miles down the road to Whitesville and put out a general order that no civilian was to enter into Whitesville city limits until the investigation was done. No matter how much the parents and teachers of Kirby begged and complained, they stood firm in their decision, saying only that it was for the safety of the populace that they weren’t allowed to use their own road.


But there’s always another road. There’s always another way. 


The tires of a beat up old off-white RV squeeled to a stop on first street, Whitesville. Smoke rolled out from underneath the old piece of shit camper truck in that way where you can’t figure out if it was just how the RV operated or if there was something straight up on fire inside of it but for some reason the owners and all the other adults around you don’t seem to be worried about it for some reason? Even though it absolutely smells like metal burning? This is describing every single RV I’ve ever been around in person by the way.


Aaaaanyway,


The side door to the RV swung open and slammed hard against the strange faux-siding all those fucking things have on them, and vibrated back a step. A hand quickly snatched the door up and held it in place as the man within the RV stepped out into the sunlight.


He stepped down onto the concrete sidewalk and looked both ways with a burning rage in his deeply set dark eyes. He ran a hand through his wavy red hair and spit on the ground all in one motion. A real prince charming type of man. He was six foot two and broad-shouldered wearing a blue jean jacket with fur at the collar hanging loose off his frame. He paced a few steps in either direction, his old brown leather boots scuffing against the ground loudly as he did. 


This was Jason Grace, failing accounting major from Southern Connecticut State University. He was many things to many people - one credit away from flunking out, a complete maniac the instant he ever got mad, a freeloader riding the fine print of a wrestling scholarship he no longer deserves, a joker, a smoker, a midnight toker - but above all in that moment he was an older brother to a missing little boy named Archie and he was there to find him and/or kill anyone that stood in his way. But he wasn’t alone.


“GET THE FUCK OUT HERE.” he screamed over his shoulder, reaching into his pants pocket and returning with a cigarette to place between his lips. 


“I wasn’t stealing anything and you can’t prove it wasn’t my photograph of an old woman who I definitely know to begin with anyway.” The short, balding man who exited the RV at Jason’s screamed command frantically spoke, almost tripping off the bottom step and faceplanting but managing to grab onto Jason’s blue jean jacket to steady himself. “WHOA! Good catch, I almost fell straight into your asscheeks which doesn’t work as an excuse as much as you’d imagine.” This was, of course, Pavlov Flinch, Private Eye.


Jason shoved the small man off of him and into the side of the RV, not even turning to face him as he kept surveying the area like a shark staring at chum. “Don’t ever fucking touch me.” He felt around in his pockets for a lighter or match and came up empty so violently ripped the cigarette from his mouth and threw it away with a snap of his wrist and a grunt.


“Alright, alright, it’s strip club rules, got it.” Flinch muttered, standing up as straight as he could and dusting his trench coat off with the palms of his hands. “By the way, just for curiosities sake, where does the doo doo go when you flush in an RV and follow-up question, if it overflows back up it’ll just go down later by itself right? That’s the theory of gravity, I think.”


Jason just whipped his head back around and glared daggers directly into Flinch’s eye sockets in that inimitable way only a genuinely dangerous nutjob can.


“Just a hypochondrical question, nevermind. You hired the best, don’t worry about the rest.” He paused a moment. “Is that a good slogan? I’m thinking of getting my business cards reprinted. Here.”


Flinch held out a small eggshell colored business card to Jason who eyeballed it angrily and then snatched it out of his fingers. It read “Pavlov Flinch, Private Eye. Ba da ba ba ba - I’m Lovin’ It ™”


“This is… this is McDonalds, man.” Jason looked back at Flinch incredulously.


“Uhm… no, it’s a business card. Are you alright?” Flinch said, tilting his head and narrowing his eyes. 


“Look, Columbitch! I hired you to help me find my little brother, not make me question my own sanity! Now straighten up and fly right or I’ll twist your head off like a fucking beer cap.” Jason shook with rage as he spoke, towering over Flinch, but then quickly dropped it and looked around the neighborhood they were standing in. “The fuck is up with this…?”


Every yard in the neighborhood was kept perfectly, with sprinklers going and pet dogs and cats running to and fro. Each yard had one or more people in it, each one doing something neighborly like mowing the grass audibly through my fucking microphone right now and ruining everything I’ve worked for with this story, or barbecuing, or just sitting on the front porch in a swing. It was like the perfect picture of Americana.


“Didn’t you say your little brother said this place was abandoned when he called you the night he disappeared? Was your brother like a little liar shitter or was he like, normal?” Flinch followed Jason’s gaze as he spoke.


“I swear to fucking god Flinch, if you say one more brainless insult at me and pretend you didn’t know it was offensive, I’m gonna bash your skull up off of your neck like a Rock Em Sock Em Robot.” Jason said through gritted teeth, starting to walk down the street with his hands shoved in his pockets. “Now let’s actually do something.”


As they passed each house walking down the street, without fail, every family no matter how big or small, no matter how pressing or important what they were doing happened to be, turned their heads and stared at Jason and Flinch and the walked past them. 


It was as if someone had paused the idyllic scene of suburban mush and all the sounds and music of it were stock still, leaving only their own footsteps below them as every set of eyes in the neighborhood bore into them silently.


The feeling of fear welling up in Flinch took hold of his heart and he tried to swallow hard to push it back down but he found his mouth too dry to even do that. He turned to try to talk Jason into turning around and maybe going to a nice Bob Evans for a little catfish dinner and maybe splitting a chocolate lava cake before he mentions he conveniently forgot his wallet and home - but Jason wasn’t standing there anymore.


No he was jogging with his hand up in the air toward a middle aged white man with a crew cut and a very short, thin black man wearing oversized glasses and an unkempt fade haircut standing on either side of a car, who both immediately began to frantically try to pretend they were doing something else and hadn’t been staring at him upon seeing Jason heading towards them. “HEY! HEY YOU TWO! YEAH, YOU! WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU LOOKING AT?!”


Both men began to panic and yanked the doors to the car open from either side and leapt inside, revving it to life within seconds and backing out into the street. Jason reached the car just as they were turning to take off down the street and began bashing his fits into the trunk. “I’M TALKIN’ TO YOU, YOU FUCKING LOOKEY-LOO BASTARDS! GET OUT HERE AND FUCKIN TELL ME WHERE MY BROTHER IS! DON’T MAKE ME COME IN THERE!


The car peeled out down the street and disappeared around the corner out of town that Jason and Flinch had just driven in on. Jason cursed loud and long before finally stopping and breathing in and out heavily, “1, 2, 3, 4…Serenity Knocks Upon Your Door…”


“Wow you’re really some kinda nut, huh?” Flinch asked, walking over with his hands buried in his trenchcoat pockets. 


Jason glared at him for a moment before rubbing the bridge of his nose and muttering to himself. “5, 6, 7, 8… Murder is illegal in all 50 states.”


“Whup, shouldn’t have said that out loud, huh?” Flinch chuckled, turning and walking away at a brisk pace.


“Not so fast.” Jason grabbed the back of his collar and yanked him back into place next to him. He pointed around the neighborhood. Everyone had gone back to what they were doing before - no one was staring at them anymore. “They can’t do their weirdo intimidation tactics now that they know it doesn’t work. Now we can actually question somebody.”


“Question a perp? What do you think we are, some kind of detectives?” Flinch laughed a little breathy, CPAP machine deficient laugh to himself.


“.....yes. You are in fact a detective. It says so on your fucking McDonalds Business Card. And the advertisement on the pizza box I called you from. Are you not actually a private investigator?” Jason said through gritted teeth, clenching his fists.


“Oh, uh… yeah. Yeah. Slipped my mind for a second. “ Flinch managed a half-hearted smile at Jason who continued to glare through him. “So uh… who do you wanna… which perp do you wanna…”


“There. That’ll do.” Jason pointed across the road to an old man sitting on his porch reading a newspaper in his slippers and robe. Since it was about 4:30pm that struck him as a little odd, so he figured he’d follow up on it. He immediately began long strides across the street and up the old man’s drive way.


“Oh fuck…” the old man whispered under his breath, doing his best to seem as nonchalant as possible as he folded up his newspaper and stood up to go inside. But his movement only provoked Jason to begin sprinting up the driveway and to take a flying leap onto the porch. “SHIT DON’T HURT ME I’M AN AARP MEMBER!” the old man screamed


Jason snatched up the sides of the old man’s robe and lifted him up into the air, holding him so they were eye to bloodshot, murderous eye. “Where. The fuck. Is my brother?” 


“Oh god, I don’t even know who you are!” the old man whimpered out, possibly pissing AND shitting at that exact moment but probably not jizzing because his dick don’t work no more. What? It happens to a lot of older guys. It’s just the way of the world sometimes, not everything has to be a joke. Wink.


“My name is Jason Grace and my brother disappeared here a few weeks ago. You’re gonna tell me what the fuck is going on and where my brother is or I’m gonna wrap your dentures around your own dick and pull it like a salt water taffy machine.”


“What?” both the old man and Flinch, who had just caught up, said at the same time, completely baffled.


“....just… just tell me where my brother is.” Jason mumbled, kind of embarrassed now.


The old man looked up and down the street in both directions and saw no one was looking at them. He motioned his head towards his front door and whispered as quiet and low as he could, “I can’t talk out here, please come inside. We can discuss everything I know there…”


Jason and Flinch exchanged glances and finally Jason set the withered old man down and allowed him to open the door for him. Flinch went in first, having no sense of danger until it was too late and even less of a sense of decorum. Jason went in next, cracking his knuckles as he passed the old man and grinning showing all his teeth. The old man gulped hard and followed suit, locking the door behind him as he did. 


“You don’t understand… speaking to you could get me killed…'' the old man whispered hoarsely, going from window to window and drawing the shades closed sharply, the loud metallic sound of the curtain rings screeching against the bar.


“If you don’t speak to us I’m for SURE gonna kill you.” Jason said matter-of-factly without much intonation. 


“Jesus. “ Flinch muttered, pretending to look at his phone to avoid all of this.


“Ok, ok…” The old man sat down in a recliner he didn’t seem super familiar with and folded his hands in his lap pensively. “My name is Boris Latchley… up until a few weeks ago, I was homeless. I lived in New Haven and hadn’t had a place to stay outside of a soup kitchen or an alleyway in years.”


“Wh…what?” Jason stuttered, actually taken aback by information he’d never in a million years could have foretold would have come out of the old man’s mouth. Not to toot my own writing horn or anything, but it was pretty wild, right? You didn’t see that shit coming either.


“An organization came and did a sweep of the streets there. We were under the impression that they were some kind police squad cracking down on bums but… they offered us a place to live. An abandoned town… this abandoned town.” The old man rubbed at the side of his head a bit.


Jason glared at Flinch who shrugged over-dramatically, “FINE, fine, it was abandoned. Your brother isn’t a little liar shit, are you happy?” Flinch paused a moment, then under his breath whispered, “he still could be though, I never met him.”


“I dunno what happened here but it was completely empty. Every house had food, running water, working sewer, everything - but not one person living here.” Boris paused and rubbed his wizened fingers against his dimpled chin. “I’m… I’m not really sure where everyone came from. There were only fifteen of us from New Haven on the bus. But when we got here there were hundreds of people… the men in jumpsuits told us to move in and pretend like we’d always lived here…”


“Men in jumpsuits?” Jason questioned, looking at Flinch.


By this point Flinch wasn’t paying much attention, he was scratching at the top of his head with one hand and turning his phone over between his fingers with his other. “Why does all of this seem so familiar?”


Boris and Jason both stared at Flinch as he thought as hard he could, steam basically shooting out of his ears like a cartoon character who’s hamster on a wheel broke down inside their head. The two less-degenerate men (though that’s debatable we dunno Boris very well and Jason’s a literal psychopath apparently) eventually turned back to each other.


“What men in jumpsuits?” Jason asked.


“They….they call themselves Gestalt. That’s all I know about them. I was more than happy to lie for them forever, I didn’t care as long as I got to have a home. But…” Boris looked pensively at the photograph of a little girl in a ballet uniform standing on stage in center light on the wall next to his chair. “I can’t shake the feeling of everything about this being wrong. What happened to the people who used to live here? What did…. What did they do to them?”


“It’s on the tip of my brain tongue…” Flinch muttered to himself, rubbing his eyes with his head down trying his damndest to think a thought.


Jason glanced at Flinch and then back to Boris, “Look, I–” he quickly double took back at Flinch and squinted his eyes at him for a moment before slowly floating his glance back over to Boris. “Look, that’s all well and spooky and I’m sure Netflix is breakin’ down your door for the documentary rights but I don’t give a shit about anything but finding my brother. Do you know anything about him, or not?”


“Uhm…no, I don’t. Aren’t you the least bit interested in the black ops cover-up of the disappearance of an entire time and their replacement, body-snatchers style, with an entirely new town full of people?” Boris asked.


“Fuck no.” Jason said plainly, dusting his jacket off and motioning for Flinch, “Let’s just bounce, this old dried up fuck doesn’t know shit.”


“Uh…” Flinch looked at Boris and then back at Jason, “Are you like… completely sure we shouldn’t follow up on this? I got nothin’ against it personally but people usually like… fight me on just ditching this kind of thing. Especially from an old guy telling portents of doom.”


“I never doomsayed.” Boris said with a raised eyebrow. “When did I portent?”


“You were portenting the entire time!” Flinch snapped back.


“BOTH OF YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP!” Jason interrupted before it went any further, causing both Flinch and Boris to jump, startled. “You!” Jason pointed at Flinch, “Let’s GO.”


Jason Grace and Pavlov Flinch spent the next several hours going door to door and asking about the whereabouts of Archie Grace with all the same measured, controlled questioning you’d come to expect from a serial killer waiting to happen and several sewer creatures wearing a trenchcoat, but none of their trademark charms seemed to garner them any further information. They were successful in getting several people to swear lawsuits against them in the near future, but didn’t get a single step closer to Archie.


“Maybe you should’ve brought a picture.” Flinch said flatly, walking down the sidewalk a few steps behind the fumingly enraged Jason for his own protection. “Or maybe like described him a little before you started doing shoryukens and flash kicks on their pets.”


“I described him just fucking fine!” Jason snapped back.


“I mean he IS a little boy and he DOES like baseball, I guess.” Flinch rolled his eyes.


Jason stopped dead in his tracks, his shoulders raised and his fists clenched. “Did you… just roll your eyes at me?”


“Damn, you weren’t even looking at me! Is that some kinda party trick?” Flinch said excitedly. “I tried to Fushigi once but I kept dropping the ball, so–”


“NOBODY ROLLS THEIR EYES AT ME, FLINCH.” Jason spun around and grabbed Flinch up by the collar of his trenchcoat once more, lifting him off the ground like he weighed the equivalent of a small nasty street dog. He also smelled the equivalent.


But just in that moment, something caught Jason’s attention out of the corner of his eye. He turned and jogged across the street, leaving Flinch looking even more ruffled than usual from the manhandling and even more confused looking than usual, which was pretty impressive honestly.


Jason bent down in the well-kempt grass in front of a quiet house and slowly reached his hand down into it, tentatively, almost as if scared to do so. When his hand returned it was holding a full-sized wooden Lousiville Slugger bat. He turned it over pensively in his hands until he finally laid eyes upon what he was looking for.


On one side of the bat, near the wider blunt end, were two knife-carved letters. A. G. Austin Grace. This was Jason’s little brother’s bat, there was no mistaking it. He had carved these letters into it himself to customize the bat at his brother’s request. He had taught him exactly how to swing to the fences with it. He had seen those letters a million times before.


He stared with soft, wet eyes at the inscription, then looked around to see if he could see anyone who could be responsible for it being her, but he saw no one. He felt the fire well within him again, the unquenchable rage he had been feeling since the moment he’d heard of his brother’s disappearance. He steeled his resolve in that first moment to do whatever it takes to bring him back, and this was a reforging of his mission.


He withdrew a pocket knife from inside his jacket and flicked it open, carefully carving into the hard wood of the bat right next to his brother’s initials one letter of his own - a J. He was with his brother in spirit now, and soon would be with him in person.


“Jag?” Flinch interrupted his reverie from over his shoulder, squinting at the lettering on the bat. “Like jag-off?”


“I’LL FUCKING KILL YO–” Jason began to scream, but was cut off by a much louder blood-curdling scream echoing up the street toward them, bouncing off the quiet suburban houses that surrounded them. Both men, or I guess the one man and Flinch, turned their eyes in the direction it came from - pretty immediately spotting it’s origin - a house they had both visited just hours earlier - the home of Boris Latchley.


Jason grabbed Flinch by his collar once more and took off at a run. The young man’s athleticism pretty much left Flinch to be dragged kicking and stumbling the entire way down the now-emptied out street to the now-quiet and still house.


He didn’t even pause a moment, releasing Flinch on the porch and taking a flying leap into the front door with his shoulder, causing the frame to splinter off the wood and the door to capsize into the living room beyond it.


Sitting in the chair that Boris had once occupied when he told them of his plight, was a tall thin man wearing a snakeskin jacket and sunglasses, sporting a wavy pompadour with a streak of green painted through it. A white dress shirt, black tie, and black pants completed the ensemble, besides a pair of snakeskin boots that perfectly matched his jacket. He didn’t even jump at the front door being thrown from it’s hinges at him, just just sat with one leg crossed over the other in a high-t position, and turned his head passively to view the interruption.


“Well now, you’re going to have to pay to get the door fixed, strangers.” The man said with a slight grin, revealing a single gold tooth in his mouth. “After all, it ain’t right to break into a man’s home unannounced just as suppertime.”


“Who the fuck are you?” Jason screamed at the man, brandishing his brother’s baseball bat in the air menacingly. “This isn’t your god damn house! It belongs to some old geezer named Boris, we were JUST here earlier! Now where the fuck is he?”


“I’m afraid you must me mistaken, son.” The man in snakeskins stood up from his seat and rubbed at the back of his neck, his eyes glaring with an intense, violent hatred over the top of his sunglasses even as he maintained an amicable smile below them. “I’ve lived here for twenty-odd years now. Never met a man named Boris in my life. Cept the British politics guy on the TV. Looks like a off-brand Wish Donald Trump, you may’ve seen him before.”


“I’ve seen him before.” Flinch raised his hand and said from well-behind Jason, mostly still standing on the front porch.


“We heard the old man scream! Now tell me where he is or I’m gonna burst your skull open like fruit in a god damn Gallagher show and I don’t give a DAMN if I’m in the splash zone!” Jason growled, shaking the baseball bat in the air.


“Oh. Well, that’s mighty unfortunate for the both of you.” the man said with a genuine bit of sadness in his voice. “I figure you could probably tell by my skin duds, but my name is Snake.”


“I couldn’t give a fuck of an asshole’s shit what your name is!” Jason yelled back immediately.


“Well, it’s only polite where I come from to introduce oneself to a fella before you kill him.” Snake threw his head back in the air the second the last syllable escaped his lips, his sunglasses flying off his head and his body beginning to convulsed wildly. Each jagged warp of his body came accompanied by the unmistakable sound of bones exploding and shattering inside of him.


Both Jason and Flinch took a step back immediately, but the man’s body took a staggering step towards them just as his flesh began to distend outward, his entire body widening out into a disgusting fleshy tube of bone and meat, his eyes long-since turning hollow and empty as he twisted and turned. 


There was something moving through him now. It started at the legs, which had somehow fused together during all of the uproar, and distended the body outward as it traveled, looking very much like a paste being squeezed from inside of a tube. Up it went, through the midsection, bursting the shoulders out, distending the head so wide it seemed nothing could hold it together - until what was once a man opened its wide, oval mouth, and from within the deep, near-endless darkness within it, a massive, forty foot long rattlesnake exploded from inside the hollowed-out human being suit, sending blood, bone, and viscera cascading in every direction as it finally escaped its flesh prison. It spilled on and on and on out of the open, fleshy, drooping maw like a train flying out a tunnel into open light, until the flesh carcass that was left simply dropped lifeless to the floor.


The massive serpent rammed its entire form directly into Jason, sending both of them spiraling backward and into the wall of the living room. In the slightest stroke of luck, Jason’s body hit a window instead of the actual wall and wasn’t immediately flattened or destroyed from the weight of the beast - instead he was flung free from the house, and landed in he front lawn almost all the way back down to the sidewalk - his skin pock-marked with gashed and pieces of glass still embedded within.


Jason rolled in the grass in agony, and felt around beside him as best he could with bloody fingers for his brother's baseball bat, almost frantic for its return. It took a second, but he felt the familiar cool embossed wood of it and drew it close to his chest, holding onto the bat for dear life even as he heard the massive slithering thing behind the wall inside moving again.


Flinch, for his part, had started running the instant that the man had began to convulse because fuck that noise, holy shit. However, thanks to his lack of cardio and general physical condition, he had barely made it to the sidewalk by the time Jason was flung out onto the grass. He spun around, horror upon his features and went to let out a loud scream…


But a hand on his shoulder stopped him. He jumped in fear, but didn’t feel the need to scream any longer. He looked down at the black gloved hand on his shoulder, and barely registered the dark figure that passed him by, walking steadily up the drive way toward the house.


“Flinch.” the figure said, a familiar voice recognized his presence, but it still hadn’t quite clicked for Flinch himself.


The figure walked past Jason, his long black overcoat floating around his legs as he went. The man wasn’t tall, but his presence seemed to go far beyond his stature. Wild, long black hair fluttered in the wind around his youthful features, dark eyes staring down at Jason as he passed him by. “Pardon me. I’ll handle this.”


The man walked through the broken front door, disappearing into the darkness within, and all was quiet for a moment. 


Jason struggled to his knees, and held his hand out towards Flinch, groaning out in pain but managing to yell out “FLINCH!”


Pavlov Flinch wasn’t a brave man, but he faced danger from several different directions here. His brain was doing coward calculations at a million miles a second. Was he more afraid of the man in black? The giant snake monster? Or Jason Grace?


He finally landed on the fact that Jason had his business card which had his mom’s address on it and Flinch didn’t have anywhere else to live for free right now where no one would judge his complete mint-in-box Alf collection. He took off at as fast of a run as he could towards Jason, leaning down and tucking himself under the younger man’s arm to heave him back up to his feet - which he failed at about four times before steadying himself enough to limp-walk.


The two of them hurried down the street back towards the parked RV on the corner as best they could, but they hadn’t even made it halfway when the entire front of Boris Latchley’s house exploded outward into the yard in a hail of wood, concrete and glass - splattering all over the street beyond it even thanks to the power behind the explosion. From within the flying wreckage, Jason and Flinch could make out two tumbling forms, interlocked in the air flailing out into the street, but it was all too fast to make out.


When the two forms landed, rolling into the middle of the quiet suburban street of Whitesville Connecticut it was all too clear what they were looking at. The gigantic rattlesnake was there, baring its massive, dripping fangs at it’s assailant, but it’s body was covered in deep, bloody gashes, from which tons of glowing green liquid poured out onto the concrete like small waterfalls. 


But it was joined now by a creature just as hideous, just as malformed and inhuman. An insectoid being, with a hardened carapace and two gigantic red bulbous eyes astride a crushing maw of bone and sinew. From the horror’s arms were sprouted two long, curved blades, which shone with the flowing green blood of the snake. 


These horrific creatures were fighting each other?


Jason and Flinch had made it back to the RV by this point, and Jason heaved himself up into the side door as well as he could manage, feeling himself becoming light-headed from what could have either been a concussion or blood loss in the moment, but he couldn’t be bothered to give a shit with a miniature kaiju battle happening at the end of the block.


“Let’s get the fuck out of here!” Flinch screamed, shaking Jason by his shoulders as the younger man settled into the driver’s seat.


“OW FUCK! Stop fucking touching me!” Jason screamed out, then darted his eyes back and forth from the unfolding fighting between the two monsters - the snake was now snapping it’s massive bladed mouth at the smaller insect man, who was leaping to and fro dodging it like it was standing still - and his own bloodied reflection in the rearview mirror. Back and forth. Back and forth. Back and…at once seeing the blood pour over one of his eyes, he gave in, “Uggghhh FUCK! FINE!”


The RV roared to life, reversing out onto the street and then turning and barreling in the other direction. Jason gripped the wheel with white knuckles as he stared at the freakshow unfolding in the distance behind him, which got smaller and smaller in his rearview. 


There was an incredibly long time where the two of them didn’t speak at all, just sat and stewed in the experience they’d both just gone through.


“Huh… I think I knew that guy. And this town! Pretty sure I was here once before for something important, maybe? There was like a cult I think… and a truck? Weird how memory works, huh?” Flinch said matter of factly, rubbing at his chin and tilting his head.


“...what?” Jason said, looking back over his shoulder at Flinch. “You fucking knew the guy who turned into a god damn cricket man and fistfought fucking Mega-Boa vs. Ultra Python back there? Who the fuck is he?! WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU!?”


“I’m… “ Flinch looked down for a moment, then continued, “I’m actually kinda late for a court date. Would you mind to drop me off in Bethesda Maryland real quick?”


THE END
