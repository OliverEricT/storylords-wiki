The Waking Dream

By Jeff Pennington

Prompts: Blood & Festivals


The pounding of shoes against the wet pavement echoed against the brickstone walls all around, but they never slowed down. It was dark, painfully dark, and squinting through it made no difference, there was absolutely no way to see what was ahead. But there was a cold, overwhelming certainty of what was behind. A thing that moved almost like a man, but its humanity was betrayed by what lived inside of it. A hungry, vicious thing that reached and clawed, always just a hair's breadth from taking its horrid prize. Until those shoes fell out from under, and the ground came up all at once. And the thing behind finally caught up.


“AGGHH!!!” TK screamed as she lunged up out of her bed, flinging her covers and prized Donald Duck plushie across the room like a spring-loaded trap. Cold sweat poured down her face as she inhaled staccato breaths, her throat burning with each one. 


Donald Duck glared at her from the floor with unblinking rage for the slight, but he was kinda always like that if you watched the cartoons so it was whatever.


She calmed herself by looking over and seeing her own reflection staring back at her from the tall mirror on her closet door. She was still who she had always been - not a faceless person stalked in the night by a Bagool, but just TK. 


Her full name was Teresa Kanzaki which she had always thought was kind of a lame name so she was overjoyed when one of the dumb redneck boys at her childhood school said her “weirdo asian name” was too hard to pronounce and had re-dubbed her “TK” instead. She didn’t even bother pointing out that Teresa was a fucking English name just like his and that he and his greasy greasy grandma probably had to repeat the third grade together next year, his entire family line was so godamn stupid. 


She had finally stopped feeling the lingering distant and hazy fear of her nightmare long enough by this point to glance down at the hot red backlit alarm clock next to her bed that read “8:00am” in static numerals. 


“OH DICKS! OH NO! OH BUTTFUCK!” TK leapt out of bed and ran as fast as she could through her entire morning routine. Brushing out her black bob haircut to look halfway presentable, throwing on her standard slightly-out of date fall look complete with a dark top, a pleated skirt, dark leggings, high boots, a cardigan pullover and a big fluffy scarf - and if I called any of that stuff by the wrong name or you think I don’t know women’s fashion like I know I do, you can send any notes you may have to brosb4prosepod@gmail.com. We definitely check that and I’ll for sure take all your tips to heart. If it sounds like Jeff is reading this sarcastically he’s totally not. Send ‘em on in.


“She’s gonna kill me.” She took a moment to pause and look at herself in the mirror. The makeup she’d hurriedly applied looked good - years of perpetually running late to everything having trained her hand in speed and precision - but she couldn’t cover up the bags under her eyes. Or the worry on her face.


It took her another fifteen minutes to bike across town in morning traffic to make it to Dos Chicas Flower Shoppe, a small quaint boutique on the corner of 7th Avenue in Kirby, Connecticut. She pulled her bike around the street and up the back alley, trying and fumbling to chain it to the old meter pipe for the building’s water pressure before she lost any more time. 


Four minutes, thirteen seconds later she jogged through the front door, the little bell over it letting out a wee little tinkle that sent a deep shiver down her back. Her late arrival was announced.


“You’re like a half hour late, TK.” came the familiar, monotone voice from the back of the shop. Out from the back room, carrying a large ficus in a planter was the most beautiful woman TK had ever laid eyes upon - Alyssa Medero. She was tall, and thin, but with really strong shoulders that were wreathed in her flowing chestnut brown hair. Her face was angelic, even with the too dark, too thick eye makeup she always wore it somehow looked perfect. She was also dressed kinda like a biker in a post-apocalypse movie which for some reason REALLY did it for TK? 80’s movies really kinda fuck us all up huh? If it isn’t childhood trauma about horses and swamps it’s inexplicable boners about bad guys we were supposed to find off-putting.


“Uhm… well, I can explain! You haven’t even let me explain yet!” TK said while her eyes quickly darted around for some kind of explanation. “Just… just gimme a second to explain, sheesh!”


Alyssa sat the ficus down by the front door and turned and stared silently at TK, her hands on her hips. 


“I uh…” TK’s shoulders fell. “I overslept.”


“TK…” Alyssa started, judgement in her voice, causing TK to throw her hands up and hurriedly scurry across the room to the front counter to pick up her apron. This didn’t deter Alyssa from continuing to judge though, “You’re not an employee here! We own this place TOGETHER! When we signed the lease for the building you promised you’d put in just as much work as I did to get this business running and yet you’re still the last one in here every morning and the first one out at night.”


TK rubbed at the back of her neck for a moment, looking at the ground. “TV has gotten crazy good lately…”


Alyssa just stared, blankly. Then shook her head, placing a small slip of paper on the counter in front of TK.


“What’s this?” she asked in response, looking it over with her head tilted to try to read it upside down.


“Mr. Realname needs a Blood Orchid delivered to the object for sale shop on 12th street by 11am.” Alyssa said matter-of-factly, crossing her arms and shifting her weight to one leg.


“If I didn’t know those were real places I’d be sure you were fucking with me.” TK rebutted with a smirk.


Alyssa did not react, but continued. “Remy went out for a delivery around 8:01, since he was on time… but he hasn’t come back yet.”


“Aw come on, you can’t compare me to Remy! He’s never even seen a boob what does he have to live for outside of work?” TK pouted, picking up the delivery notice and shoving it into her cardigan pullover’s side pocket.  


“Just deliver the damn orchid, TK. Please? Just pretend like you actually care about this flower shop with me for once, ok?” Alyssa said with exasperation in her voice.


TK felt the words sink deep into her heart and a familiar ache awaken in her chest. She lost her flippant attitude almost immediately, “Hey, Alyssa… you know I care about this shop, right? I’m kinda flakey with time but I’d do anything to keep us afloat. This is my livelihood too, y’know?”


“Yeah… yeah.” Alyssa said in a completely noncommittal tone like your dad does when he says I love you. 


TK paused for a second and sat in the awkward moment, desperately trying to figure out what to say next, but settling on “...alrighty, well. I’ll be back in a few.” before she headed for the front door, the Blood Orchid in its pot all wrapped up tucked under her arm. 


“Hey, TK wait…” Alyssa called after her, causing TK to turn around. “Be careful out there, ok? The police haven’t said that the woman who disappeared across town was a murder or not but I don’t want you disappearing the same way, y’know?”


“Man this town is kinda goin’ nuts lately, isn’t it?” TK observed while tilting her head for more remembering power or whatever the fuck reason we all do that as humans. “That lady goes missing like into thin air and none of her family knows anything one day and the next some kids ride their bikes off into nowhere and the cops shut down the entire road to the next town. No in or out.”


“Thank you for the exposition.” Alyssa said to me, Jeff, the writer, but also to TK, smirking a little for the first time today. 


TK felt an old jolt in her body - a sudden impetus to make a move she hadn’t dared try for a long while now. “Hey… uhm…” she paused, the actual movement suddenly making it far more difficult to continue as if the reality of the situation set in too quickly. But she powered through. “Maybe after work tonight… would you like to go to Goonie’s Bar and get a couple drinks? The uh… the Big Gooner is half off on weekdays for alcoholics only.”


“I uh… I don’t think that’s a good idea.” Alyssa returned awkwardly, her smirk now completely wiped from her face. “We tried that once before, remember? For four years. It didn’t work out so great. Let’s be professionals now, like we have been since the… the uh… well, you know. Ok?”


“Oh uh… yeah. Yeah, you’re right, of course. Sorry.” TK hurried as fast as she could out the front door, the tinkling of the bell over it a gentle reminder of her place now - business partner. Alyssa stood and watched, rubbing her arm and trying not to let old feelings cloud her judgment.


TK pedaled as hard as she could to try to get away from Dos Chicas Flower Shoppe, feeling much more like Una Chica than she ever felt like Dos at the moment. Honestly maybe she felt more like zero chicas or whatever zero was in Spanish. Was it cero? That didn’t sound right. Maybe her inability to learn Spanish had cost her Alyssa’s heart cause fuck she was bad. 


The Super Real Thing Shop or whatever I called it was plenty of blocks away so the ride felt like forever to sit with your feelings in the early morning, but at least she could admire the town of Kirby along the way. It had once been a bustling, thriving small town community with shops lining every corner of the pristine streets but a Wal-Mart with a McDonalds in it had moved in so people had no use for any of that shit and now it was a fucking wasteland. Just like every other small town in America.


Well, to be totally fair, it was still a pretty charming little town compared to how Wal-Mart buttfucked the rest of America, just with a lot less shops and a lot more HOAs with the death penalty for painting your shutters blue or getting the wrong color gray door handle. I hear they put a pumpkin bag over your head before they flip the switch but that raises the HOA yearly fee by $700 per person. 


What was I writing? Oh yeah, Storylords, gotcha.


TK slowed her bike to a stop when she came across a bike tunnel she had ridden through a hundred times during her small town life here. She’d always found it pretty charming and small-towny before, but something about it gave her pause this time. It seemed darker inside somehow. Or maybe she felt the creeping memory at the edge of her mind of the dream she’d suffered this morning. Either way she thought for a moment about taking the long way and cutting down Maple Grove Avenue.


But eventually she decided to pull up her big girl pants and stop being such a weirdo about it. It was, however, way too dark to ride her bike blindly through it so she stepped off the bike and just pushed it into the tunnel, flicking the flash light on on her phone to guide her way forward.


Inside the tunnel the cold blue-white flash reflected off of the strangely wet cobblestone below her feet in a way that made her feel instantly uncomfortable, though she couldn’t discern exactly why. It had rained recently but that had been three days ago. It could still feasibly be wet under her, she told herself, trying to shake the looming uncertainty from her mind as she pushed forward.


Dread kept her flashlight pointed down and forward for most of the way through the underpass, but even through the overwhelming feeling of something being wrong there was the telltale draw of curiosity at her periphery. And she was nothing if not a curious cat so she eventually gave in, swinging her flashlight around under the overpass left and right.


To the left there was nothing but a few stray beer cans and a McDonalds wrapper or two - the clear signs of civilization achieving its ultimate form the nation over. Big thank you to Ray Croc and The Walton Family for bleeding rural America dry, they’re lovin’ it ™ and also whatever Wal-Mart’s dumb fucking slogan is now. Who cares.


She also saw the brickstone walls, bone dry on this side and most of the cobblestones beneath her feet also being dry. She felt a chill in the air as she turned her flash to the right side of her.


At first she couldn’t discern what she was looking at. Not many people can see what she saw that day and understand what they’ve laid eyes upon. It was a pile, like one that would be made up of broken trash bags or old discarded refuse, but it was soaking wet, and that wetness had permeated the wall beyond it and the cobblestone walkway almost all the way to either end of the tunnel. The off-white brightness of the flash light tinted it in such a way that it wasn’t immediately recognizable. 


But when the light found the center of the pile and reflected against two wide open, lifeless eyes piercing a veil of red and pink, she couldn’t have missed exactly what she was looking at regardless of anything else. She’d seen those eyes hundreds of times staring back at her with a cool, youthful indifference just as they stared back at her with a hollow, lightless blankness now.


It was Remy, the delivery boy from her own shop.


The refuse that surrounded him, ripped and torn from bone as if by the hand of some gigantic ravenous beast was the flesh, muscle and viscera of Remy the delivery boy, piled high upon itself like a monument to the human insides pulled to the outsides. The wetness that stained the ground below her was a deep, dank crimson, that permeated the stone deep - Remy’s blood had been spread from one end of the tunnel to the next. 


The stench suddenly hit her and the first wave of it threatened to make her pass out from either fear or revulsion, but upon her body’s first waft towards unconsciousness she finally let loose the scream that had been building in her body since the beginning. She screamed loud and clarion clear through the tunnel, her entire body convulsing with the endless dread that poured out of her.


She threw her head back and her scream grew deeper and the deep reverb of it on the walls of the tunnel became a loud, hollow reverb within the voice itself. Her hair flung around her on winds that did that flow, her body raised from the ground from the force of strings which did not exist to hoist her. Her pupils split open like two uncooked eggs and ran the black of them across her entire sclera, eating the color and the brightness and leaving only the black empty void within them as tears streamed down her cheeks. 


A force erupted from her, outward and into the walls surrounding her on both sides, and whatever it was pushed each and every brick in that wall further into the foundation beyond them - each one driven further into the concrete than the last, creating large fissures which splintered the stone here and there and shaking the very ground beneath her with her virulent horror.


And then everything went dark.


Her eyes slowly fluttered open, the brightness beyond them making it especially hard to quell the blurriness which assailed her enough to see. She felt nauseous but couldn’t remember why. It took several minutes of blinking before she found herself in a bed unfamiliar to her. Small machines beeped out her pulse and a tube ran into her arm which she desperately wanted to scratch at but she knew better.


She was at Kirby County Hospital. She’d been here before, a long time ago. But this time, she remembered why.


“Remy…!” she screamed out, but a hand on her shoulder calmed her slightly.


“He’s… he’s gone.” Alyssa Medero sat beside her in a small folding hospital chair, looking worse for the wear with weariness. “When you screamed when you… when you found him, a bunch of people at the Polka Festival on Main heard so the cops found you pretty quickly.”


“Polka Festival…?” TK said with eyebrows knitted in confusion. “We have a polka festival…?”


“It’s been going on for over a hundred years, TK.” Alyssa said with a slightly relieved smile. 


“....they must be tired of yodeling by now.” she managed to squeak out, laying back into her pillow. 


Alyssa managed a small laugh. “I’m just glad you’re ok…” she became more grim almost immediately though, “The disappearance of the lady across town is a murder. I heard the cops talking about when they took Remy’s… when they took Remy away. They found her the same way. There’s a serial killer in Kirby and no one knows it but us now…”


“Alyssa there was something…. Something happened to me.” TK managed to sputter out, “At the… in the bike tunnel. When I saw Remy, I…” 


Alyssa placed her hand on top of TKs and held it tightly, shaking her head and biting her lip to keep from becoming emotional herself, “Don’t worry about it. We’ll talk about all of this when they release you… It should be tomorrow morning, I think. You just get some rest now, ok?”


TK did feel an intense level of weariness down to her bones. A type of tired she hadn’t felt in over 15 years at this point. That horrible night 15 years before. She nodded through a half-lidded gaze at Alyssa and managed a weak little smile before sinking further into her pillow.


Suddenly she was five years old, standing in the middle of the rubble of her own childhood home. Streaks of red lined the grass in three directions beyond the edges of the stone and splintered wood of the house she had known since she was born. She shivered in the cold night’s air and listened to the familiar sounds of fire engines and police sirens in the distance. She looked down and saw dangling from her hand was a small brown teddie bear wearing a bow-tie. Most of its body was blown to pieces and dangling from thin thread and stuffing. 


She tried to hold it to her chest, but it fell apart, piece by piece, onto the broken earth below her feet. They slowly fell into place in the darkness until the teddy bear’s head landed atop the pile, except it was Remy’s bulbous, empty eyes staring back at her from atop his own entrails and bones twisted and broken and horrendous.


She turned to run but she suddenly couldn’t move. She looked down, and saw her own hands replaced by those of two elderly withered dark-skinned hands which pulled hard at the bindings that held them in place against the chair she was tied to. She felt a frantic fear in her chest she could barely contain and heard pleading and screaming coming from a mouth that was hers and also not hers all at once. 


From the darkness in front of her came a man with eyes reflecting the slight light in the room, looming over her with incandescent pupils which bore right into the heart of her. He spoke words she couldn’t hear but it didn’t matter, she could feel the hunger within him - the same type of feeling prey feels when faced down with their direct predator.


She turned her eyes frantically around the darkness for any hope of escape, any light amongst the oppressive shadow. She glanced the clock on the wall, barely hanging from it, and the time on it was burned into her mind. 4:23am. 


“AGHH” TK screamed, lurching forward from her nightmare, finally awake from whatever hell she had found herself trapped within. She heaved breaths and looked around in the darkness of the hospital room for Alyssa but found no one. Visiting hours must have been over a long, long time ago. 


She laid back into her pillow, her blood electric in her veins and her heart pounding like a piston against the inside of her chest. She knew she had to look but every fiber of her being was inundated with the fear of it. She looked anyway.


The clock read 3:44am.


“I… I can’t… it’s… this is insane. None of this is real…” TK whispered to herself in the darkness, but by the time she’d finished her last word she was already yanking the tube out of her arm and disconnecting the heart monitor diode from her chest. She swung her legs over the edge of the bed and steadied herself on her feet.


She thanked whatever luck she had left amidst all this indecision and fear that her clothing were all laid out nice and clean on the chair Alyssa had been sitting in when she had first awakened here. She threw them on faster than she had ever remembered getting dressed, the flatline sound of the machine no longer picking up her pulse letting her know she had very limited time before a nurse would show up.


By the time one did, she was long gone.


The bill for her staying there would be 46 million dollars. After insurance.


Her bike had been parked out in front of the hospital in the normal bike racks thankfully and it had been easy and quick to take it and leave. It was the pedaling the entire way across town that was the hard part.


She felt as if she’d been beaten by baseball bats the entire day before, every muscle in her body in direct pain from every move she made,but she still pedaled as hard and as fast as she could to get where she was going.


Where she was going, however, was as much of a mystery to her as it was to the audience listening to this. Thankfully I know where though, so settle the fuck down, I’m getting to it. 


She rode her bike on blind in the freezing night, feeling the stinging of cold on her nose and cheeks and though she hadn’t a clue where she was going she definitely knew when she had gotten there.


She stared, wide-eyed, up at the abandoned shop front that stood in front of her, reading “Blockbuster Video” in phantom letters underneath the outline of an old movie ticket still burned into the concrete signage above the barred double doors. Being 25 years old she’d only really heard of these places in stories told by boring ass Millenials in nostalgia-bait Tik-Tok videos and cringey Star Trek podcasts so this was entirely new for her.


But one thing did catch her eye, besides an entire generation desperate to hold onto the last shreds of their misspent youth doing so by deifying a chain of video rental stores that couldn’t turn a profit - the side door down the alleyway next to the shop was slightly ajar… and there was a dim light coming from inside.


“What am I doing…?” she whispered to herself in the stale, cold night’s air, her breath heaving heaping lungfuls of painfully cold air.


And almost as if in answer to her question, she laid her bike down against the wall of the building and crept around to the side of it. Every step she took felt unsure, wobbly, slow, reticent, but she still took them. One at a time until she was standing close enough to peer into the crack between the door and the facia, squinting into the dim light inside to try to see what was beyond it.


A single threadbare light swung back and forth in the dark, illuminating the refuse-strewn floor below it, but nothing alive anywhere within its purview. She sighed a quiet sigh of relief but knew what she was looking for wouldn’t be under a light anyway. It was entirely too dark within her dream for that. 


What she did see beyond that light though was another ajar door in the darkness beyond it. And a voice somberly speaking in the doldrums of an echo she couldn’t make out words in.


She looked down the street in both directions, then into the dimly lit doorway again. “God damnit…ughh…” she whispered to herself, then slipped inside.


After an excruciatingly long sidle up to the next door, she could peer inside once more, and the sudden shooting pain in her head at what she saw told her she had arrived where her dreams had lead her.


A man stood with his back to the door, his head in his hands and his shoulders hunched over. He was quietly sobbing into them and wore a crumpled old blue business suit with tags and holes in it, filthy from overwear. He had thinning short brown hair from what she could see but she couldn’t see his face at all.


In front of him, tied to an old metal chair, was a dark-skinned women with high-piled black hair, slumped over forward with her innards spilled out of her stomach all over the floor in front of her, her body still and lifeless in the acrid, heavy darkness. TK covered her mouth to keep from screaming at the sight, but took notice of the clock on the wall beyond her she had seen before.


It read 4:40am. Too late.


The indignation that welled up in her chest, that burned at her heart, scorched away all of the fear which had swirled in her body all day up until now. She stood up straight and kicked the door inward, swinging it hard against the wall and causing it to crash against it. 


The man swiveled to face her, his tear-stained face fare more stained with the bright red blood of his mutilated victim. His reflective eyes shone white in the darkness and his body convulsed inhumanly at the intrusion upon whatever the fuck this all was to him. Murder? Cannibalism?


“You… you monster! You fucking sicken me…!” TK screamed out in a voice that was slowly filling with a hollow reverb beyond its timbre.


“Y…you don’t understand…! This isn’t who I am!” the man screamed back, panic in his voice. “You don’t know what they did to me..! What they turned me into..! “


“I don’t care! You murderer! You psychotic freak!” TK’s voice rumbled the room around them, small bits of debris and trash beginning to slowly raise off of the ground on winds that came from nowhere, alight by a force beyond the understanding of both figures within the room.


“I was a man…! I had a family… I loved my family… my wife… my son! My SON! They don’t even remember who I AM anymore!! They… they took me… in the night… and I escaped their facility! But when I got home… my wife… she didn’t know who I was anymore! They did something to her! Oh god!” the man screamed and ranted, his skin convulsing and moving as if something was writhing just beneath the surface. “They did… something to me…! I didn’t do any of this!”


“LIAR!!!” TK bellowed out, her voice overlaid with a deep, demonic reverb which echoed over and over as if through an unseen canyon between the two of them. Her body shook and she began to convulse herself, her arms and legs splaying out into the air. She raised from the ground once more, a force from within her bending the laws of gravity without her even understanding how or why.


Her mind was completely engulfed in a turbulent rage at that moment. Her sclera were swallowed by blackness, engulfing her entire eye in a darkness so deep that no light reflected upon it. 


“STOP!!” the man screamed, his face splitting open and long, serrated pincers exploding out of the open gaping wound left behind, chittering and slithering through the flesh toward the freedom of open air. 


But the force that erupted from TK would stop the transformation short before it ever could. Steel, wood, concrete, everything evaporated like a raindrop on the breeze. The force pushed outwards in a continuous circle, flattening the building and everything around it for several dozen more feet, flat to the ground. 


The thing that was the murderous man erupted into a fountain of blood and innards so sieved that they could not be told apart from blood, holding in the air for but a moment until the onslaught was all over, then dropping to the ground in a heavy liquid slorp.


TK blinked. She was standing in the middle of Dos Chicas Flower Shoppe, wearing a completely different outfit. Go google ‘fall women’s fashion’ and pick one, fuck you. But it was completely different than the one she wore before. 


Alyssa handed her a tablet with a window of a news story up on it. “This is nuts…” she said somberly. TK took it with shaking hands and trembling lips and read it out loud, in her own normal voice.


“Serial Killer Found Vaporized…?” 


“They apparently matched his blood to some found in the other victims, I guess…” Alyssa trailed off, not that TK was really listening. She looked around at the Flower Shoppe, and everything looked perfectly fine. Like nothing had ever even happened to her. But the headline… what Alyssa was talking about. That all happened to her, right?


“When did I… when did I get out to the hospital?” she stuttered out.


“What?” Alyssa looked confused. “Are you ok? You left in the middle of the night three days ago.”


“And… and where did I go? What did I do?” TK rubbed her eyes with the backs of her hands, mostly out of automatic response to overwhelming stimulus.


“Uh… maybe we should take you back to the hospital…” Alyssa placed her hand on TK’s shoulder to try to comfort her, but when TK glared at her she removed it. “Ok.. ok… uh. You went back to your apartment. You called in and said you needed a couple days to rest. You literally JUST walked back in. Do I need to update you on the conversation we’re having right now, too?”


“No, it’s just…” the fear and confusion suddenly felt secondary. She was alive. Whatever had happened at that Blockbuster… no… no she wasn’t going to pretend like she didn’t remember it anymore. The strange power. The dreams. All of it. She’d always remembered it. Ever since was a little girl. 


“Nevermind. I guess I’m just a little tired.” TK smiled a weak smile.


“That’s ok, it’s understandable.” Alyssa said with her own smile, though it was more reassuring. She picked up the tablet and looked it over again, shaking her head in disbelief. “I’m just still wondering who the hell this serial killer guy even was. Where he even came from. I guess we’ll never know.”


“Boy do I have a newsflash for her, dude.” a voice came from the other side of the room. A cold chill exploded up TKs back and she slowly turned to see where it had come from.


Standing across the room, not a few steps away from Alyssa who seemed to absolutely not even notice he was there, was a thin teenage boy wearing ripped up jeans, chuck taylors, a flannel shirt tied around his waist and a backwards UConn Huskies, hat was a god damn fucking GHOST floating in the air in the reclined cartoon position that Bugs Bunny has when he’s chillin’ out while duking Elmer Fudd.


“W…wuh…” TK stuttered out. 


Alyssa looked up and then looked where TK was staring and then back at her, not registering anything. “You ok? You’re acting super weird today.”


The ghost looked up at TK as well, floating over toward her with wide eyes and a surprised huge smile on his face. “YO, you can see me, brah?! Holy shnikes that’s wiiiiild, dude!”


TK stared straight at him with mouth agape, her entire body frozen in place.


“Yo, psychic dudette, you’re NOT gonna believe this dude, but my name is DIPS and I TOTALLY know who caused that fucked up killer monster mash dude, brah!”


THE END.
