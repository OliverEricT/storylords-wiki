	Prompts: Pacts & Sacrifices
</p>
<p>
	The wind rustled through the leaves scattered across the blacktop and pavement outside the Motel 6 on Route 60, near Huntington, West Virginia. The dingy two-story building was ringed by bent old metal railings, had mostly cracked windows, and was only identified by an old rusted sign slowly swinging in the breeze, whining with an old, hollow metallic squeal with every sway. The sun had set behind the rolling mountains and the opaque blue tinge of night had just washed over the woodlands that could be seen as far as one could look in every direction besides up and down the lone stretch of highway that bisected it.
</p>
<p>
	The serene sound of crickets chirped, night birds called in the distance, and frogs ribbited their love song into the cooling night air and not a sound could be heard outside of the calmness of oncoming night.
</p>
<p>
	“This fucking blows shit.” Kris groaned out loud, kicking the metal railing with her gigantic black combat boots with the weird pleather finish all Hot Topic shit has. The sound of the metal shaking could be heard echoing off the mountains in every direction. “This inbred backwoods ass motel is gonna get us chainsawed by mountain freaks and it didn’t even have the courtesy to play Dueling Banjos first!”
</p>
<p>
	“Kris! You’re gonna get us in trouble! Grandpa Big Mike brought us on this trip with Aunt Lorraine to see the Statue of Liberty out of the kindness of his heart! Don’t you wanna see the majesty of lady liberty, bastion of freedom and democracy, as she’s perched above the drug den of violent rats and godless sinners that is New York City?” Peggy hoarsely whispered in that way people with no inside voice whisper where it’s just talking normally but with an extremely annoying pretend whisper tone over it.
</p>
<p>
	Kris sat back down on the metal grated steps that had lead them up to their single second floor room for four fucking people. Great planning Aunt Lorraine, how many “adult juices” did you smash before teaching at Sunday School before you decided on that one? Oh the three parts of The Holy Trinity? Glug, glug, and glug, right Lorraine?
</p>
<p>
	“Grandpa Big Mike fought in the war but for the other side.” Kris said.
</p>
<p>
	“...which war?” Peggy asked earnestly.
</p>
<p>
	“All of ‘em.”
</p>
<p>
	“Why do you say stuff like that?!” Peggy demanded, placing her hands on the hips of her overalls, which happened to be covered in sparkly Lisa Frank stickers and iron-on Bible Camp award patches that said things like “Most Heathens Converted” or “Most Bible Verses Prosthelytized To Minorities Per Minute.”
</p>
<p>
	“Because it’s rad.” Kris said, not even paying attention to what was going on anymore as she fiddled with her phone. “UGGGHH there’s no signal here! This place is duxant as fucksant! I can’t believe Lorraine dragged us out here with wrinkly ass old war criminal Grandpa Big Mike!”
</p>
<p>
	“He’s not a war criminal! He was never tried!” Peggy yelled out, her voice echoing off the mountains that surrounded the valley the motel was situated in. She shot upright and placed her hand over her mouth in shock at her own voice. “Oh no…! It’s ungodly for a woman to speak loud enough to be heard…!”
</p>
<p>
	“God I wish I was literally anywhere but here. I’d love to drink a delicious beer of any kind, which I drink all the time, cause beer is awesome and what we love to drink.” Kris said with a wry smirk, pausing for a moment to look out of the corner of her make-up pancaked eyes to see Peggy’s reaction.
</p>
<p>
	When none came because Peggy was contemplating how to make it up to Jesus that she had an opinion as both a female and a child, Kris immediately blurted out “Us as in cool kids. Like, adults. Like me. I’m not a lame little kid like you.”
</p>
<p>
	“Do you think Jesus forgives people? They didn’t mention that at church…I know he loves guns and supports George W. Bush but…” Peggy trailed off.
</p>
<p>
	Before Kris had the opportunity to snap at her, the tension in the air was broken by the ringing of a telephone. Both cousins looked at each other, equally startled, but Kris immediately settled back into her practiced air of cynical stoicism. Peggy whipped her head around in the direction the ring was coming from however, and her eyes landed immediately on Room 13.
</p>
<p>
	“Isn’t that the room that–”
</p>
<p>
	“THEY SAY THAT ROOMS HAUNTED SOME FIFTEEN YEARS NOW.”
</p>
<p>
	Both girls whipped around with wide eyes, Kris letting out a little yelp of surprise, at the sudden booming vocal intrusion. Standing in the center of the landing behind them was a man in his mid-50’s, wearing a pair of stained blue overalls, and leaning on the end of a mop handle whose head was soaking in a yellow bucket with wheels on it. You know… a janitor. You’ve seen the type.
</p>
<p>
	There was a full ten seconds of silence as the two girls stared at the janitor silently before Kris coughed in her hand.
</p>
<p>
	“A MAN DIED IN THAT ROOM VIOLENTLY THEY SAY. GOT STABBED BY A JILTED LOVER. THEY SAY HIS SPIRIT CLINGS TO THAT ROOM HOPING FOR BLOODY VENGEANCE AGAINST ANY WOMAN STEPS FOOT INSIIIIIIIDE.”
</p>
<p>
	“Who in the FUCK are you, even?” Kris finally yelled out, standing up from her seated position on the steps to stand between the man and Peggy protectively.
</p>
<p>
	“...Janitor.” he said plainly, turning and pushing his bucket down the landing toward the other end of the building.
</p>
<p>
	“Do you think he was telling the truth?” Peggy spoke up first, watching as the man turned the corner at the end of the landing and disappeared.
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah I mean who would pretend to be a janitor at a Motel 6? That’s way too fucking sad. There’s like, no motivation in it.” Kris said matter-of-factly.
</p>
<p>
	“No dingus! I mean about the ghost in Room 13!” Peggy pointed to the old rusty placard hanging on the wall next to the door across from them emblazoned with the number 13 on it. The phone inside had never stopped ringing this entire time, a steady bleating ring, a moment of silence, and another, piercing the tranquility of the night that neither of these annoying ass fucking kids seemed to care about. “Sorry I said the D word.”
</p>
<p>
	“How the fuck should I know? People die in motels all the time.” Kris looked at her phone and began to angrily press buttons and shake it a little as she spoke half-paying attention, “People go to motels to bone down and die. I can only hope Grandpa Big Mike brought us here to die.”
</p>
<p>
	“What does bone down mean?” Peggy asked.
</p>
<p>
	Thankfully just then both girls noticed a small bit of greenish light escaping Peggy’s backpack which she’d left propped against the motel room door they were staying in. They exchanged glances for a moment before Peggy leapt for the backpack with a huge smile on her braced face. She yanked up the pack and unzipped it with a hurried yank, diving an arm in and returning with her intended quarry - a wide green candle placed inside of a flat gold candle holder with a long curved handle. The short wick at the end was already slowly burning with an eerie green flame which danced and tucked into itself completely independent of the wind.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s lit?” Kris asked with a raised eyebrow. “Oh shit… wait… it’s lit! I gotta get on livejournal and blog that, it’s gonna catch on like wildfire! It’s like ‘its really cool’ but like a billion times fucking meme-ier they’re gonna love it on–” Kris looked at the bars on her phone and kicked the metal railing again, sending birds flying out of the trees nearby. “FUCK I FORGOT THERE’S NO SIGNAL! Now I’ll never get to be big shit on the internet!”
</p>
<p>
	“There must be a spirit nearby…” Peggy whispered, completely ignoring whatever the fuck Kris was on about that whole time. She turned her eyes to Room 13 and then back to Kris with a wide, metal-studded smile. “C’mon, this looks like a mystery for The Candle Cousins!”
</p>
<p>
	“Look, I’m not playing along this time. You go try and help a dude who died with his dick out make it to heaven. I’m gonna go find a place to bury myself alive to escape existence without internet …and also existence in general because that’s what we do.” Kris turned to walk away but stopped and turned back, “We as in cool people. Like me. I’m cool.” Then she turned and walked back into their shared hotel room.
</p>
<p>
	“We made a pact when Grandma died, Kris…!” Peggy called after, but the only sound she heard in return was the booming raging voice of Grandpa Big Mike as his mind continued slipping into dimentia.
</p>
<p>
	“SHUT THE DAMN DOOR, THE VIETCONG WILL SEE THE TV LIGHT.”
</p>
<p>
	“Alright Grandpa Big Mike, calm down…” Kris’ voice followed.
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t talk back to your grandpa, Kristine!” an older female voice cried out as the door began to close.
</p>
<p>
	“Blow it out your ass, Aunt Lorraine! I know about your “special friend” at the women’s club! Just accept who you are already, it’s the new millennium!” Kris screamed back as the door finally shut.
</p>
<p>
	Peggy soon found that Room 13’s door was unlocked because it needs to be for this story to continue. She pushed it open slowly and nervously and was immediately surprised to find that the lamp next to the ringing telephone across the room was on. It glowed with a small hum, like an incandescent bulb left on far too long, but the blaring sound of the phone ringing did well to mask it with every chime.
</p>
<p>
	She cautiously walked across the otherwise pitch-black room, her hand unsteady as she held the candle aloft in front of her to light her steps. The floor was sticky beneath her keds but that wasn’t shocking - it was a motel after all. Being caked with decades worth of piss and jizz was par for the course.
</p>
<p>
	Finally she slid her hand around the receiver and lifted it from its perch. She slowly drew it up to her ear, and swallowed hard to steady her voice. “Hello…?” she managed to drag out.
</p>
<p>
	There was a moment of silence then that hurt her ear for some strange reason, and then a loud, harsh click before a voice came on the line
</p>
<p>
	“Good evening, Miss. I apologize for calling at such a late hour but I believe there’s something you can help me with.” the voice on the other line was smooth, and deep, with a noticeable southern drawl that was hard to pinpoint to origin to.
</p>
<p>
	“Uhm… who may I ask is calling? This is a vacant room…” Peggy hoarsely responded, her eyes constantly darting to and fro in the darkness of the room.
</p>
<p>
	“Consider me a concerned citizen. I understand you deal with the paranormal quite regularly so I’m calling upon your …expertise on a matter close at hand where you’re currently staying.”
</p>
<p>
	“Wait… you know who I am? Wha… How do you know me? What I do?” Peggy was suddenly very much regretting not trying harder to get Kris to come along, more of her unshakeable self-confidence tied up in their partnership than she’d like to admit, even to herself.
</p>
<p>
	“I suppose your reputation precedes you. Unfortunately there is a rather…unsavory ritual being performed in the woods across the road from where you’re staying. There is a spirit there in need of absolution. I believe that falls squarely within your wheelhouse.”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re not answering me! Who ARE you and how do you know who I am?!” Peggy was getting a little frantic at this point, holding the candle up higher to better light the room around her. The dancing flame casting moving light in every direction was doing nothing to assuage her mounting fear.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m sure you’ll do the right thing.” Click. The voice on the other end of the line was gone and the connection was dead. Peggy held the phone to her ear in silence for just long enough for the cacophonous repeating tone to let her know the call was over whether she liked it or not.
</p>
<p>
	She hurried out of the room as quickly as she could, somehow so shaken that she couldn’t even be bothered to be afraid if someone was in the room behind her or not. When she stepped out the door into the freshly lit halogen lights that lined the front of the motel she was instantly greeted by the sullen, pale features of her cousin Kris, who stood with her arms crossed and her back against the metal railing.
</p>
<p>
	“Who was it anyway? The Mothman calling about a bridge?” she said with a rueful grin.
</p>
<p>
	“There was a man on the phone…” Peggy said with a long glance over her shoulder, rubbing the arm holding the candle at its end with her other hand idly. “He seemed to know… who I am. Maybe about the candle…? He said he knew I dealt in paranormal stuff and that there was something going on across the road over th–”
</p>
<p>
	She stopped her sentence dead as she pointed across the road, and Kris turned her eyes to follow where she pointed. Standing on the other side of the two lanes of Route 60 was a young boy wearing a long sleeve striped shirt and a pair of khaki shorts. But the most obviously noticeable thing about him was the fact that he was glowing from head to toe in an unnatural hazy blue. His body drifted and wafted in the air as he stood in place, like the reflection of a person in murky water.
</p>
<p>
	He was staring directly up at them where they stood.
</p>
<p>
	Peggy slowly raised a hand in the air to wave down to the boy. Kris looked at her with apprehension but then turned and raised her hand up in the air as well to wave. The glowing boy raised his own hand, not in a wave but in a beckoning gesture - motioning for the two of them to come down to him.
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah fuckin right… who’s braindead enough to come when a child ghost waves them over?” Kris snorted, shaking her head.
</p>
<p>
	There was another moment of silence.. “You’re not even standing there anymore, are you?”
</p>
<p>
	Peggy was racing down the stairs when she finally turned to look, headed out across the parking lot and toward the road. Kris sighed a heaving, pained, sigh from the very bottom of her being. “You dumb bitch…”
</p>
<p>
	By the time Kris had caught up both girls were now standing on the other side of the road, right in front of the ghostly apparition of a young boy. The boy held his hand up and opened his mouth, a horrific low rumbling growl escaping him instead of any words, causing both girls to recoil away from him in shock. The sound was guttural, and unnatural, and seemed to cause something inside of each of them to curl inward for protection.
</p>
<p>
	“Grrrrruhhhhhhhhhhhooohh sorry, I guess that’s what ghosts sound like? I don’t fucking know I just died like twenty minutes ago or somethin’? Shit’s wild out here, man.” the boy said much more plainly, shoving his ghost hands into the pockets of his ghost khakis.
</p>
<p>
	The Candle Cousins exchanged awkward glances and then returned their stare to the boy.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh shit, sorry, I guess where’s my manners? My name’s Dusty Peterson. I just got stabbed to death by some fuckin’ weirdo in the woods right down there.” He pointed back over the side of the railing and down the hill toward the treeline. “Me and my girlfriend Rita were finally gonna kiss our genitals together like in those movies my Dad likes but some BIG ol’ boy hopped outta the underbrush and poked me fulla holes ‘fore I could poke her fulla holes if you catch my drift. I don’t really know how sex works. Guess I never will now!”
</p>
<p>
	“Uhm… I’m Peggy. This is my cousin Kris….” Peggy said absently, scratching at the back of her head.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, pleasure to meetcha. Could one’a you do me a quick favor, maybe?” Dusty rocked back and forth on his heels, glancing back over the railing.
</p>
<p>
	“Uh… what?” Kris said, contorting her features up in disgust at the possibility of having to explain sex to a dead virgin.
</p>
<p>
	“Nothin’ untoward I’d just like you to go and rescue my girlfriend Rita. I think the two guys that grabbed her were gonna do some kinda say-tanic richell on her or somethin’ cause they were both wearin’ robes and hoods and whatnot.” He paused for a moment. “Not like… not like white ones or nothin’, even if this is kinda the area for that kinda… look it’s a cult thing, I’m pretty sure of it.”
</p>
<p>
	“Uhm, well… “ Peggy leaned over the railing to look down into the pitch black forest below. The only light she could see beyond the scope of the halogen lighting of the motel were the flittering fireflies in the tall grass and amongst the low trees. When she turned back to speak to Dusty, however, he was gone. “When did he…?”
</p>
<p>
	“What?” Kris looked up from her phone and then looked around with a little confusion on her pallid features. “Wait, did he leave? I found Snake on my phone and it’s actually not bad when you got nothin’ else to do.” She immediately ducked her head back down and began to twiddle her thumb over the screen, her dull expression perfectly lit by its back lighting.
</p>
<p>
	“Could you please take this seriously?” Peggy asked with a touch of frustration in her voice.
</p>
<p>
	“This one seemed chill, I didn’t think he would mind.” Kris said with a heavy shrug. She rolled her eyes and tucked her phone back into her front pocket. “Uggghhh fine, you’re such a fucking melvin, though. Everything’s about ghosts with you, it’s like, get a hobby or something.”
</p>
<p>
	FLASH FORWARD.
</p>
<p>
	The two of them had been traipsing through the underbrush for twenty minutes at this point - the full moon overhead was lighting the way through the trees well enough, but Peggy still had her backpack with her which meant she had her trusty ghost hunting equipment - including her powerful flashlight which was bobbing up and down illuminating the almost non-existent path in front of them.
</p>
<p>
	“Is it really smart to have a flashlight out when you’re looking for a murderer?” Kris asked flatly, following along a few steps behind and rueing the fact that she was still wearing all that pleather and faux-flannel on such a muggy ass night. At least she was dressed rad and would never look back on this in twenty years and cringe her fucking soul out of her asshole at the very thought she ever decided this looked good. There would be no lying awake at night in disgust of her fashion choices for THIS epic winner.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh…” Peggy said quietly, and then flicked off the flashlight about twenty minutes too late. She tucked it back into her bag and held up the green, softly burning candle into the night’s air instead. She didn’t seem to notice it was also putting out light.
</p>
<p>
	Finally the duo came to the edge of a clearing, and the high moon in the sky lit it out perfectly enough for them to see the scene before them with unclouded eyes - though they may have wished to the contrary.
</p>
<p>
	In the center of the field, a large stone was positioned, and tied down onto it by chains and spikes driven directly into the rock, was a young girl wearing a long white tanktop and a pair of jean shorts. Her mouth was covered by a piece of red fabric and her eyes were widened in terror as she stared up at her captor above her.
</p>
<p>
	A small man stood next to her, one knee up on the rock, and one hand holding onto a gigantic gold-wreathed book, which he was feverishly reading out of out loud - some kind of language that neither Candle Cousin could recognize. He was wearing a large pointed hood and robes, both in blood red ringed with white at the sleeves, with an etching of an eye on the forehead of it. In his other hand he raised a red-stained dagger up to the sky as he chanted.
</p>
<p>
	Both girls recoiled from the sight, but both had to really work not to scream at what they saw next - a bloody, dripping, flayed corpse dangling from a tree branch near where the man held the girl captive. It was so desiccated and rended that it was hard to make out much about it, but the pile of organs laying on the ground underneath it told the story of the horrors it had gone through to get there. But it was obvious looking at it… long sleeve shirt… khaki shorts. It was Dusty Peterson’s body.
</p>
<p>
	“Perhaps you would like a closer look.”
</p>
<p>
	Both girls screamed bloody murder as the gigantic man appeared out of the darkness between them, his massive hands clasping onto the back of their shirts and yanking them up into the air with absolute ease. He walked with them like someone carrying groceries from the underbrush, his long red and white robe dragging through the foliage with some difficulty. They continued to scream as he threw them both down onto the ground near the rock at the center of the field, both recoiling away as best they could from the two robed men.
</p>
<p>
	“We are gifted with visitors, I see.” the smaller man said, his voice gleeful.
</p>
<p>
	“Indeed.” the larger man said with a deep, gravely baritone.
</p>
<p>
	“An abundance of riches upon the night of our first baptism.” the smaller man returned.
</p>
<p>
	The two girls had managed to stop screaming by this point, though each had a mind racing a million miles a second through every scenario they could conjure of the horrors they were experiencing. Somehow the horrors of spirits, spectres, and haunts didn’t ever seem this real.
</p>
<p>
	“You see, ladies, our ascension requires a sacrifice… the blood does not flow through the veins in the sky until it flows openly on the ground.” The smaller man said, twisting the jagged dagger he held in his hand around in the pale moonlight, the red tinge of blood shimmering.
</p>
<p>
	The larger man folded his arms over his chest and said nothing, looming over them with malice.
</p>
<p>
	“Y’all about beat all, you know that?”
</p>
<p>
	The two robed men spun around, their open hoods facing the eerie blue light of Dusty Peterson’s ghost standing at the other end of the clearing, shaking his head. “Y’all kill a body and then leave him scattered all over the field in little bits then try to entertain lady folk for the evenin’ without even cleaning up? That’s just unmannerly. At least have the dog eat the body up like a civilized person. Maybe feed ‘em to the pigs.”
</p>
<p>
	The large man reached into his robes and pulled out a huge pistol, which he instantly opened fire with. The cracking of each gunshot echoed into eternity off the surrounding mountains, but Dusty Peterson didn’t move, his hands shoved into his ethereal khakis like a preppy hick Casper the Friendly Ghost.
</p>
<p>
	Peggy and Kris exchanged terrified glances but the sight of one another calmed the burning fear within their chests. They nodded at one another, and split off in two directions, crawling through the high grass as fast as they could manage.
</p>
<p>
	Peggy went straight for the girl tied to the rock - Rita. She moved past the smaller man through the weeds as quietly as she could go as he ran across the field to join his comrade in their assault on their unwanted ghostly guest. She guessed neither of them knew what a ghost was or something? Cause why would you shoot bullets at it? Maybe it’s like those guys who shoot at Superman and then when the bullets run out they throw the gun at him. That was always funny. Anyway, back to business.
</p>
<p>
	She was on top of the rock and yanking as hard as she could at the chains and pitons that pinned the girl to the stone, grasping onto them and then leaning all her weight back over the side of the rock and pulling with all of her might. She was like 95 pounds soaking wet though, so nothing was budging in the slightest no matter how much she pulled. Her heart was in her throat every time she glances over at the two grown men intent on their murder. Intent on leaving them as ripped apart as Dusty’s body.
</p>
<p>
	At about the same time all of this was running through Peggy’s mind like a hot iron, Kris picked up a log from the ground, as big as she could manage given her age and size, and bashed it as hard as she possibly could into the back of the larger man’s head.
</p>
<p>
	The log splintered into dust at the moment of contact and the large man simply turned and looked at her, completely unmoved. Peggy was overwhelmed with complete astonishment that THIS is what Kris thought the plan was. This was a level of secondhand embarrassment that no human being has ever experienced before, she was pretty sure. That, mixed with the primal terror, was a weird ass cocktail of emotions.
</p>
<p>
	Kris screamed at the top of her lungs, turned, and ran full tilt back across the field toward the woods where they had come from. She didn’t even look back. That’s cold as fucking ice.
</p>
<p>
	Peggy’s weight and struggling finally loosed one of the pitons holding the chains to the rock, and she came crashing down onto the ground beside it. Rita yanked her body free on the side that had been jostled apart and tumbled down onto the ground next to Peggy in a heap.
</p>
<p>
	The bullets having no effect on Dusty and the sound of the piton ripping from the rock both drew the two hooded figures away from their assault. The larger man threw his pistol to the ground and reached inside of his robes, returning with a woodsman's axe grasped firmly in his fist. The shorter man brandished his bloody dagger and both began to run back toward the gigantic boulder in the center of the clearing they had lashed Rita to for sacrifice. They were screaming hateful words, but none of them registered in the cacophony.
</p>
<p>
	But all of that would be put to a stop almost immediately then. The ghost boy at one side of the field reared his body up and screeched into the night, the air behind him beginning to spiral and spin in on itself. His body contorted and elongated and the space behind his body began creating what looked like a vortex in the very night he stood in. It swirled and ebbed and grew deeper and deeper still, drilling into the very fabric of reality. The air within the vortex began to congeal into an inky black and a cold, haunting white, spinning inward into an abyss beyond its apex. The two hooded men stared in horror, their faces still hidden but their body language screaming terror.
</p>
<p>
	Peggy snatched Rita’s hand and pulled her to her feet, both of them running as fast as they could across the field toward the woods edge. Kris, for her part, had not just run the fuck away when the option presented itself to leave her cousin to die by ritual sacrifice, and was motioning for them at the far side of the clearing. The three of them met up there and dove into the bushes at the edge, disappearing on the other side into the night.
</p>
<p>
	“Just kidding, I dunno how to do any of that.” The ghost of Dusty said plainly, the vortex behind him disappearing instantaneously. The still breeze of the chill night replaced all of this horrendous loudness as the only sound audible for a silent, calm moment. He chuckled softly. “Anyway, fucked you two morons plans up good n’ plenty so I’m happy to move on. Y’all suck my big ol spectral ghost dick while you’re at it. BYYYYEEEEEEE”
</p>
<p>
	And with that, he vanished into thin air.
</p>
<p>
	The two men exchanged glances from under their hoods and then looked back at the stone they were meant to sacrifice a young woman on. The smaller man shook his head, walking slowly over to it and placing a hand on the cold rock. He glanced up at the moon hanging low in the sky, then back to his larger compatriot.
</p>
<p>
	There was a tense moment of quiet between the two before the smaller man broke it.
</p>
<p>
	“Quite vexing, Mr. Nero.”
</p>
<p>
	The larger man nodded in agreement. “Quite vexing indeed, Mr. Cornwallis.”
</p>
<p>
	—--------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	The three girls didn’t stop running. Heaving breaths, heavy footfalls, a dozen or so horror movie trips for dramatic effect, a quick stop in at 7-11 for some Slurpees and a rotating microwave hotdog, nothing could stop their flight for safety.
</p>
<p>
	Along the way they passed a beat-up old Ford F-150 sitting next to the road, the light inside on and the radio lightly playing some old country standard into the open night thanks to its windows being rolled down. It had all the earmarks of being a sanctuary amidst the horror and they almost ran up to it for help, but were stopped cold in their tracks when they saw the same eyeball symbol from the two men’s hoods etched into the side of the truck bed, underneath an old rusty sign for “Matheson Repair Services”. They crouched and moved as fast as they could around it, terrified that they would be seen, but nothing ever moved from the truck, nothing ever stirred in that terrifying night for them.
</p>
<p>
	They ran on until they were safely tucked away behind the Motel 6, away from the road, and away from prying eyes.
</p>
<p>
	They all leaned heavily against the wall, puffing and panting and trying to catch their breath for a long while. Rita eyed the two girls with confusion and suspicion but could not speak without the air in her lungs, so they all had to wait.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, she coughed once or twice, then spoke, “How did you…? How COULD you have…?”
</p>
<p>
	Peggy reached into her backpack and returned with the wide green candle upon its golden stand, holding it up to the light. The flickering green flame at the end of its wick slowly faded and then fizzled out completely in the air. There was the sound of exhalation upon the wind and then a stillness in the air. Peggy looked at the candle for a moment and then smiled, sharing a look of relief with Kris.
</p>
<p>
	“....ok that doesn’t fucking tell me a god damn thing. That’s a candle. What is going ON?” Rita asked with a growing panic in her voice.
