City Limits

Prompts: Monoliths & Ice

By Jeff Pennington

Continued from: The Recruitment of Ryo, episode 21. Seriously go back and listen to it that was a pretty good one and this one is mostly just alright. Also for understanding the story or whatever. It doesn’t really matter. None of this matters.

All five of our chosen heroes had been in a car together on their way to Whitesville, Connecticut to stop the apocalypse for about 10 hours at this point and most of them had found new and exciting ways to force their intolerable personalities on one another.

Pavlov Flinch had decided that he could only sleep nude, even during a car trip, and that it was everyone else’s fault that they were gonna have to see his ‘rude boy bits’ as he kept calling them. And frankly they should be thankful for the opportunity, as not many people had ever been blessed with it and if this new dating app didn’t work out very few ever would in the future either. It took Kayla actually physically restraining him with his seatbelt tied around him like a dog harness to keep him from dropping trow and flopping dick and ball all over the leather of their ride, a gigantic black 1958 Caddilac El Dorado.

Myrtle Smellie, Kayla’s student teacher assistant and loose-necked ghoul sidekick, had decided about two hours in, after Kayla had feigned never having heard of Kingdom Hearts to avoid her talking about it, that she was going to have to describe in excruciating detail the entire plot of the video game series Kingdom Hearts to everyone in the car. On hour 5, Flinch had declared that if he had to hear the phrase “But that wasn’t the REAL Ansem” one more fucking time he was going to rip out of his dog harness and throw himself into traffic. There wasn’t even a slight pause before Myrtle launched into a full explanation of the difference between Xehanort and Xemnas for the third time, and everyone in the car turned to punch her all at the exact same time but she ducked at the last second and they all punched each other instead like a Looney Tunes gag. Note to self: Write a better joke here before the book version.

Kayla S. Hunter declared on hour 5, after all the cross-punching, that she was going to swear revenge on the various two-dimensional cartoon characters in the vehicle she was forced to interact with for them destroying her normal, happy, productive life with their Scooby Doo and The Thirteen Ghosts ass bullshit. When Myrtle pointed out that Kayla had been running headfirst into that kind of shit since she was, herself, in college, and that they had only known each other for a few weeks, Kayla grabbed Myrtle’s neckbrace and yanked it off, causing the girls head to go flopping around her shoulders like a broken bobblehead doll. It took another hour to get it to schlorp back into place in order to tie the neckbrace back on and secure it to her shoulders. Flinch continuously made wretching noises the entire time.

Ryo Tachibana just stared straight forward, unblinkingly. His breathing was shallow, and his thousand-yard stare was completely blank. He was shaking slightly in his seat, his hands gripping at the fabric of the old fur-lined jean jacket he was wearing. He had to go back into his house and quickly shower off and retrieve some clean clothes, but all that was left was stuff from high school. It still fit okay, but was kind of tight in the shoulders. The real problem though was trying not to get any more blood on his outfit when he was leaving since his mother’s insides were painting the walls like a talentless Jackson Pollock had gone apeshit in the living room. Beyond that, as he sat catatonic in his seat, he was haunted by the taste in his mouth. Rusty copper. A strange, hard to quantify taste of raw meat. A familiarity that turned his stomach and hollowed out his heart all at once.

“Is this gross freak gonna be alright?” Myrtle said casually, slapping Ryo’s cheek with the back of her hand a few times. “He looks like J.J. Abrams got hired to reboot his favorite franchise.”

“Stop touching people, you rotting little fuck!” Kayla yelled out, slapping the back of Myrtle’s head and almost causing it to fall over the front of the neck brace it was held on with.

“WHOA NO the brace isn’t tight enough!” Myrtle yelled, grabbing onto her head and holding it in place.

Kayla rolled her eyes and tried to re-adjust the neck brace, “Oh jesus, hold on… hold still! I’m trying to get it back in! It’s too small for this!”

“Boy if I had a dollar for every time I heard that.” Flinch said with a shake of his head and a heavy-lidded, dull-faced smirk. He caught himself after a second and turned his dopey gaze back over the seat toward the back row, “I’d have no dollars cause it’s big. Like at least whatever inches is considered almost the biggest one. Like 15 or whatever you’ll believe.”

“WILL YOU ALL SHUT THE FUCK UP FOR FIVE FUCKING SECONDS?!”

Everyone in the car, even Ryo who had been caught up in the enormity of his own heinous crimes, turned their eyes to the driver’s seat at once, in complete silence.

Gripping the wheel with white knuckles, and teeth gritted, Indrid Cold was seething in his seat, hunched forward with shoulders shaking. “Don’t you fucking SHITBAGS ever shut the fuck up?! I’ve been driving you for HOURS and not once have ANY of you said anything worth the spittle you flecked all over my new car! You’re a bunch of genuine braindead troglodytes and I can’t WAIT to be done with you!!”

There was a long, pregnant pause in the El Dorado then, that dragged on and on.

Finally, it was strangely Ryo who broke the silence, “Isn’t this dude supposed to be like…enigmatic and otherworldly or something…?”

“He… usually is…” Kayla said with a growing amount of suspicion in her voice.

“Also where did your dumb hick accent go? No offense to dumb hicks like yourself of course.” Flinch said, while trying to loosen the part of his seat-belt that was clamping his neck to the seat.

“I’m…” Cold adjusted himself in his seat back to normal position, and cleared his throat, his eyes darting around behind his red sunglasses. “I’m normal. Everything’s cool.” He cringed at his own words, and then corrected himself, “Everything is fine. We’re all fine. Let’s just go back to whatever you were saying before. Penis size or whatever. That’s fine.”

“Are you bullshitting right now?” Myrtle said incredulously, leaning up to the front seat to look directly at him.

“Come to think of it, every time I’ve ever seen you before you made me feel like… queasy or something. Like, really uncomfortable and off my game. Like you just kinda radiated bad vibes.” Kayla puzzled out loud, leaning around to stare up at Cold herself.

“It’s weird hearing somebody else get this treatment. I see why people like doing it so much though, it’s pretty fun. You also smell like pennies and shoe polish for some reason!” Flinch prodded, flop-sweatily.

“That’s… that’s just… my cologne.” Cold began to sweat visibly, gripping the wheel tighter again. “Oh look! We’ve entered city limits! Better… better make a pit stop at this gas station! Gotta refuel!”

He yanked the wheel over as hard as he could, everyone in the car being slammed into the door or into each other, jostling around like bumpercars as the El Dorado skidded to a sudden halt.

“If you’ll excuse me…” Cold threw the driver’s side door open and leapt out of the car, barely even clearing his seat-belt as it slid off of him back into its feeder. He did that awkward speed-walking gait around to the side of the gas station building. A big hand-painted sign announced that’s where the pay phones were.

“Well that was… weird…” Ryo said distantly, watching as Cold disappeared around the corner.

“Yeah who the fuck needs to use a payphone in this day and age? He gonna buy an AOL minutes disk while he’s in there?” Myrtle added as she climbed over Ryo like he was some old luggage piled in the seat, then hopped out the car herself.

Everyone got out of the car at this point, and surveyed their surroundings. They could very plainly see, about a half mile down the road, a big wooden sign declaring “Welcome to Whitesville, Connecticut! Home of the Angels!”

To their other side was an extremely run down old gas station, and rows and rows of conifers leading off into the distance. The station’s lights were off inside, only the reflections on the windows visible. An old wooden sign whistled in the wind thanks to all of the old holes in it, old curly lettering announcing this station as “The Pump n’ Dump Gas Station & Refuse Station.” and then in smaller, serifed letters bellow it, “This isn’t a funny name!” with a small cartoon man in an apron winking next to it and holding a gas pump.

“Is this place even open?” Kayla asked, shoving her hands into her leather jacket pockets and walking towards the front doors.

“Hey Ryo, pump the gas while I go in and see if there’s any booze or ointment to score.” Flinch motioned back at Ryo as he passed him following Kayla.

“I… I’m pretty sure I ate my mom…” Ryo said distantly, his whole face contorted in horror.

“Everybody’s got a sob story, just wait for the sad violins to kick in while you pump the gas, cricket boy.” Myrtle said as she too passed him up, waving him off in the exact way that Flinch did, except she was skipping and smiling as she did.

Ryo looked back at the car, then after them for a moment, sighed heavily, and then lifted the gas pump.

Kayla grabbed the old curved metal handle of the door and pulled, and sure enough it swayed open with a loud, rusty squeal. She held the door open and motioned for Flinch and Myrtle to go inside. “You two do whatever it is you do when I’m not around - I assume molt your skin and eat it. I’m gonna look around a bit.”

“I mostly eat potted meat and yell at Judge Judy for being mean to the guys in her court show.” Flinch stated plainly, walking past her into the darkened gas station lobby.

“Please don’t leave me alone with this man.” Myrtle said with a frown as she walked into the station as well. “He smells like an abandoned dumpster and looks like an abandoned dumpster with a weak chin.”

“You’re a match made in heaven,then.” Kayla said, allowing the door to shut in Myrtle’s face and walking away. “Or the other place.” she mumbled.

Kayla stealth rolled about a 14 and skirted around the edge of the building until she was within eyeshot of where Indrid Cold had run off to. He was back-turned from her and was holding a payphone to his ear tightly, pacing a little in place with a bursting sort of panicked energy. Kayla leaned around the corner as best she could but couldn’t make out what he was saying. At a loss, she quickly did a super sick combat roll from the corner to behind that gigantic silver speckled, rusty Ice display cooler all gas stations perpetually have throughout all time and hunkered behind it. She held her hand to her ear to listen in:

“No, no… I got them here, just like you said.” Cold said nervously, without a hint of his accent. “I don’t know man! How the hell should I know?! You paid me to get them here and now they’re here. That’s my part, man. You’re the guy after that.” He paused for a long time, listening intently and looking around like a cornered animal waiting for the predator to pounce.

Finally he yanked his sunglasses off, revealing not only a pair of dull brown eyes behind them but a line of pale make-up that ended just past the edges of the shades. “Look, I’m done! I’m done and it’s over! There’ in town and I’m fucking out of here! I’d rather go back to being a shoe-shine boy than deal with this bunch of freaks and your fucked up shit!”

He paused for another moment, wildly scratching at his dark hair. “Yeah… yeah alright. I’ll just collect the payment then. Alright…well fine.”

At this point Kayla ducked away and back around the corner as quietly and quickly as she could, running at a sprint back toward the car.

When she arrived, Ryo had just finished pumping gas and was hanging the pump back up on its stand.

“Look uh… guy I just met today. I dunno if I can trust you or not cause you apparently ate your mom or something but..” Kayla went on, breathlessly, not giving Ryo enough time to react to that except with a hollow, aghast look on his face, “That guy who drove us here isn’t Indrid Cold. Whatever he told you is a lie. He was hired to bring us here by somebody and I have no idea why now.”

“The only thing in that store that hasn’t expired is the rats.” Myrtle said from behind them, walking up with her hands in her pants pockets and a wistful look on her face.

“Seems fine to me.” Flinch said casually, drinking a thick brown slurry out of a can labeled “New Coke.”

“The guy who drove us here isn’t the real Indrid Cold. He’s an imposter.” Kayla said plainly.

“That’s cool he was always more of your friend anyway, I barely know him.” Flinch said, burping. One of his eyes then slowly started to wander out of place until he shook his head, the pupil returning to the center. “....alright, you might be right that this is a LITTLE out of date.”

“That’s such an Ansem thing to do, though.” Myrtle said with a gigantic toothy smile, her pallid features brightening up instantly now that she can talk Kingdom Hearts. “But not the Ansem you might be thinking of!”

“I want to go home so bad right now…” Ryo whimpered, rubbing his eyes with the palms of his hands.

“Why, to see your mom?” Flinch said, taking another long sip of his New Coke.

“Alright, let’s get this show on the road.” The Cold Imposter said as he walked back up to the group. He held his arms out and ushered everyone back toward the gas station. “Let’s all head inside and see if we can find any supplies. We’re headed into the hornets nest now and won’t have another chance before stopping the blood moon.”

The four others standing in the parking lot exchanged glances and then Kayla began waving for them to form up together. “Group huddle real quick?”

“...fine.” The Cold Imposter said, taking a few steps away from the group as they huddled up in a circle.

“Nobody touch my butt or anything, I’d really hate if that had to happen.” Flinch said, hiding a weird little grin the entire time.

“Now THAT’S something the Ansem you’re thinking about would say.” Myrtle said with a knowing little chuckle.

“Look you utter degenerates, what are we gonna do about this guy? Do we play along with him and go into town until we can see what his deal is or what?”

“I don’t think we have to worry about that anymore.” Ryo said plainly.

“What do you mean?” Kayla said, surprised to hear him speak.

“Well he’s driving away right now.”

Everyone in the group huddle quickly stood back up and looked in the direction Ryo was pointing. Sure enough, the Cold impersonator was peeling the fuck out of the parking lot at full gas, and swerving onto the highway. The car zoomed down the road like a rocket loosed from it’s silo, disappearing past the Welcome to Whitesville sign and back out of town.

“Well that about solves that problem then. Good job, team!” Flinch said triumphantly. Everyone stared at him for a couple seconds in utter disbelief before continuing.

“Ok… now what?” Ryo asked.

“Well we’re gonna have to get some help. I’m not sure if going into town now is the best idea or not. Who knows if the Acolytes are even going to be performing a Blood Moon Ritual tonight or not now? This could’ve all just been an easy way to get their enemies in one place to kill them off.” Kayla said, shaking her head. She paused and looked at Flinch for a moment before adding, “Also you’re here too, I guess.”

“Acolytes?” Ryo questioned with a tilt of his head.

“Yeah… the Acolytes of the Third Birth? The weird ass cult? The reason why we’re all here because they’re trying to kill us all for one reason or another?” Kayla said, increasing frustration in her voice as no recognition crossed Ryo’s face.

“I’ve never heard of them.” he said, shoving his hands in his jeans pockets. “I was kidnapped by a human experimentation syndicate called Gestalt. Indrid Cold or… whoever the hell that was told me that’s who we’re all uniting to destroy so that they can no longer hunt us and harm our loved ones.”

“I thought you said you killed your mom?” Flinch said, puzzled. “Did they like hire you to do it or something? Are you your own archenemy?”

“I think the fake Cold played you, man.” Kayla said callously. “ This has nothing to do with any shadowy science lab turning people into monster or whatever. That’s ridiculously kids fiction stuff. This is the real world. We’re dealing with an eldritch cult trying to bring about doomsday by summoning an angel from the moon like it’s a big egg.”

“I don’t have any cell service.” Myrtle interrupted, holding her phone screen up to show everyone. “I was trying to search the Kingdom Hearts wiki to see if Noctis222 had made any updates to my pages so I could REPORT HIS DUMB ASS for shipping like always but I can’t. He’s probably RUINING the Roxas page right now. He belongs with Axel and she should KNOW THIS!”

“Can I go home now? I was supposed to give my mom her heart medicine 16 hours ago.” Flinch muttered.

“The only other vehicle in this parking lot is that truck over there. Do you think whoever owns that will be back?” Myrtle pointed across the way. Sitting at the back edge of the parking lot, near the tree line, was a beat up old Ford F-150, with an incredibly rusted old sign tacked to the driver’s side door that read “Matheson Repair Services” in barely legible lettering. The windows were rolled down on either side of it but no one was inside and it looked like the truck had been there for quite some time.

“We’ll just call for help on the payphones. We just need seventy five cents for a call.” Kayla looked around the group, holding her hand out toward them. They all stared at her blankly. “Not ONE of you has 75 cents?”

“You don’t have it either.” Ryo said flatly, starting to get REAL tired of these three.

“I’m a millennial, none of us carry cash.” she retorted.

“Or own a home. Or have a good relationship with your parents. Or have any savings.” Myrtle said with a grin.

“I want this day to be over.” Kayla muttered, turning and walking back toward the front doors of the old abandoned gas station. “I want this LIFE to be over.”

Myrtle quickly took off in pursuit of her employer, leaving Ryo and Flinch standing there in silence in the middle of the parking lot. A long moment of quiet passed, the wind in the trees nearby the only sound, before Flinch opened his mouth to speak

“Fuck off.” Ryo cut him off instantly.

Flinch simply closed his mouth and looked away.

Inside the story the air was thick and musty, particulate floating around in the sparse light beams that penetrated the old smudged over windows. The aisles were jagged, pushed aside or toppled over, and mold grew along the floor between them, grown from some long forgotten food item or beverage left there to rot. Even though it was day outside it was almost impossible to see anything in here beyond what was within a few feet of you - the horrid acrid smell dangling in the air was the only hint of just how bad it really was beyond your vision.

Kayla searched through her jacket pockets and found that she had left her small flashlight in the car - which was now probably twenty five miles away from here at the least. She cursed under her breath and squinting into the darkness, the bright shafts of light from outside only serving to make it darker and harder to see past them. She drew her cane out in front of her and began to tap it against the floor to check where she was going.

She fumbled in the dark, trying not to touch anything on the way. She knew how most gas stations had their set-up, the check out was always somewhere close to the door, and if she could just score three quarters amongst the detritus there then they would be home free. The crunch of glass beneath her boots was not comforting the notion this place had already been ransacked however.

All the while, at the corner of her eye, a strange shaft of pure black stood in the very center of the room. She assumed that it had to be a support column, but every time she moved it felt like the pure black monolith slowly moved along with her, twisting to always face directly at her. After a few minutes she wasn’t assuming any longer, she was trying to convince herself. She tried to put it out of her mind, and pressed on in the mottled shadows that enveloped her.

She felt around the front display and found the opening to behind the checkout, the deathly silence in the air making the hair on the back of her neck stand up as she pushed around within it. It was quiet enough inside you could hear a pin drop, no wind, no motion, all encompassing silence.

“I see you.”

Kayla lurched back away from where the sudden deep booming voice had emerged, but instantly felt the ragged pain of sharp stone dig into her skin, her entire body wrenched up from the ground and heaved through the air - the disorientation of the darkness only adding to the absolute horror of the fall.

CRASSSHHHH - the glass gave away around her and splintered into every direction, her body slamming into the hard concrete and rolling along it, glass clattering the ground alongside her. She struggled to roll back over to look in the direction she had been thrown, her vision blurry at the edges as she coughed and wretched the pain away desperately.

From within the broken remnants of the front window of the gas station lobby slowly came the hulking, horrendous form. The inky black within birthed the body slowly from its darkness, revealing jagged stone and chitinous scale overlapped over twisted and mangled flesh. Two sets of glaring, smoldering red eyes pierced into her very being as the wet, chittering mandibles below them moved in syncopation, over row after row of serrated yellowed teeth. It’s massive clawed forearm emerged from the darkness clamped tightly around the midsection of Myrtle Smellie, swaying back and forth in its grip and kicking her legs and thrashing her body against its confines. She let out a horrified scream, and bashed at her captive to no avail.

Kayla slowly pushed herself up to her hands and knees and coughed up a small pitch of dark blood onto the ground before turning her eyes back up at her assailant. “Mr. Nero…” she greeted, glaring through narrowed eyes at the familiar hulking monstrous form before her.

“Ms. Hunter.” it returned from somewhere deep within the maw behind the slithering mandibles upon its face.

“Jesus fucking christ what is that?!” Flinch called out, stepping rapidly back and behind Ryo for protection. Like a human meat shield really. A Flinch Classic.

“A…. a Chrysalid!” Ryo called out, horrific recognition crossing his face, before slow confusion dawning on it a moment later. “But not… not the same… it’s…”

“AAHHHHHHHH!!” Myrtle screamed, as the gigantic Mr. Nero hurled her through the air like a beanbag into the distance. She came down hard, slamming into the side of the old pickup truck near the tree line and causing it to shake on its axle from the strike, bouncing off, and landing face down in the dirt.

“Oh fuck…!” Kayla screamed out, turning her eyes back to Mr. Nero and unsheathing her sword from its cane scabbard. With incredible speed she began to sprint forward, taking a running leap through the air at the massive horror that stood before her … only to be slapped out of the air by his massive bladed claws, slamming into the ground herself.

“There is nowhere to run this time.” a familiar voice said calmly, stepping out of the dark store interior behind Mr. Nero. The small man in a white suit took his hat off and fanned himself with it, a gigantic wide grin upon his round features, his eyes hidden by small round black sunglasses. Mr. Cornwallis sneered and chuckled to himself, tilting his head to look around his massive compatriot. “No school to drop on top of Mr. Nero to slow him down.”

Mr. Nero’s bladed fingers drove down into the ground on either side of Kayla’s head and set themselves in the perfect formation to come together and rend her head into a dozen pieces.

Mr. Cornwallis’ smile faded. “Kill her.”

But a scream ground the entire situation to a halt. Echoing off the trees all around them the voice was twisted and inhuman, and cavernous, causing everyone who could turn their eyes to look in its direction.

Ryo’s body shook and convulsed, his eyes empty and his mouth drooped down unnaturally low from its jaw as if disconnected. His form folded over on itself, his muscles popping and bursting as they shifted around themselves, pushed and pressed from within. And then suddenly, like a balloon bursting, his entire body exploded in a grisly, horrific mess - revealing within it the horrific monstrous form he was now doomed to walk the Earth as for all his days - just below the skin.

Black and green chitinous skin of its own, slick with blood and viscera almost glittered in the sunlight. Its elongated head was thrown back to the sky to release its horrendous screeching sound into the air to mark its own third birth. And once it was finally done screaming, it dropped its head down, its segmented red eyes glaring with an intensity and hatred neither Mr. Nero nor Mr. Cornwallis had ever seen before in their long, hateful lives.

And then, like a bolt of lightning loosed from the sky, it was leaping toward Mr. Nero, it’s arm outstretched, a long, thin, sinewy blade jutting out of its flesh like a fresh wound.

And then

To Be Continued
