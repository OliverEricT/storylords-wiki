Help! My Landlord is a Monster! (Even Worse Than a Regular Landlord, Somehow!)

Prompts: Trombones & Miasma

By Jeff Pennington


Theresa Kanzaki, better known to her friends and loved ones as T.K. had been sitting silently staring at the far back wall of Dos Chicas Flower Shoppe for about five straight minutes at this point, her hands folded in her lap and her mind racing a million miles a second to reconcile everything that had happened to her over the last twenty four hours.


Her ex-girlfriend and current business partner Alyssa Medero leaned against the front counter with a nervous, caged animal kind of energy that would have normally really done it for T.K. but she knew it was mostly because Alyssa thought she was going bug-fuck insane and not because there was gonna be any bumping and grinding in the near future for the two of them. Or ever, to be honest. 


“So like… you totally followed my whole story, right lady-bro?” a reverberating voice echoed from nowhere into T.K.’s ears, causing her to shudder and close her eyes tightly to escape from it. The radiant ghost of a totally radical 90’s skater dude floated right above her head as if he was laying on his back under the sun with hands crossed behind his head, one leg crossed over the other in the air. He had introduced himself as “Dips” earlier, but T.K. still felt she must have misheard him. That wasn’t a name, even for a figment of her creeping early-onset dementia.


“Do you… still see him?” Alyssa asked hesitantly, fiddling with the zipper on her leather jacket as she avoided actually looking at T.K.


“If I said no will you stop dialing 9 1 and then hanging up?” T.K. asked with one eye open to look at Alyssa now. The two of them huffed out a slight chuckle, but the tension in the room was as intact as your mother’s butt virginity is not. She nasty, actually.


“Is she talkin’ about me?” Dips asked with a tilt of his head that caused his entire ghostly body to begin listing in the air like an old derelict spaceship in a much better science fiction story you’ll hear later in this episode. “Pretty rude to talk about a dude like he’s not in the room, dude.”


“She can’t see you, you godamn dunce!” T.K. snapped, then recoiled back into herself, hand over her mouth. Alyssa frowned and knitted her eyebrows at the outburst. 


“So you do still see him.” Alyssa said defeatedly, leaning back against the counter again and lowering her head to think. She was struggling with what to do with the entire situation. T.K. had been flaky and weird before, everybody and their whore of a mother knew that, but she’d never been straight up delusional before. And it couldn’t be because she was overworking herself cause when did she ever work herself to begin with? Not like that whore mother of yours worked herself, I’ll tell you that much. Alright, I’ll do a different joke now.


“Look man, I’m not trynna cause any bad vibes or harsh waves here, brah. I’m only tellin’ you what I learned from floatin’ around here and there untethered from the mortal coil and searching for some kind of purpose beyond the time and space of human existence. It’s like first grade stuff, dude!” Dips said while crossing his arms and legs and beginning to float upside down in place. He looked around idly for a moment.


“Why can I see you and she can’t?” T.K. asked in a hushed whisper, as if that was going to make her seem less insane. 


“Oh cause you’ve had, like, a brush with the supernatural and whatnot. Whenever you touch the boundaries between the waking world and the beyond you gain the ability to understand the esoteric, brah. It’s forbidden knowledge type stuff that is inescapable once you’ve stepped past the threshold, you know?” Dips floated over next to Alyssa and looked her up and down, or from his perspective, down and up.


“Oh also I can just do this.” He then drew back his spectral arm and shoved it directly into the top of Alyssa's head, straight down to the elbow disappearing into her dark brown curls. Alyssa immediately jolted upright to her full height and her pupils disappeared from her eyeballs, her mouth agape and her entire body beginning to shake violently.


“WHAT THE FUCK?! STOP! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!” T.K. screamed out, jumping up out of her chair and throwing her hands out in warning.


Dips withdrew his arm from within Alyssa’s head and shrugged. Alyssa, for her part, immediately stopped convulsing and her eyes returned to normal with a blink. She breathed heavily, stumbling back a step and gripping onto her forehead like she’d developed a sudden, horrendous headache.


“Whoa, what the hell was…” she turned her head toward Dips, and suddenly recoiled away, her arms and legs flailing as she fall backwards into a display of mums, sending pottery and dirt exploding all over the floor around her. “HOLY FUCKING SHIT, WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!”


“Harsh, bro.” Dips said, shaking his head.


T.K. had rushed over to Alyssa’s side by now and was trying her best to help her back up to her feet, but Alyssa was still pretty godamn terrified at the spectre haunting the center of her flower shoppe so nonchalantly. 


“She can see you now?! Why didn’t you just do that to begin with?! You let her think I was completely off my fucking rocker for two straight hours!” T.K. snapped.


“Pretty sure that’s like the real cause of cancer, or some junk.” Dips said, floating back to rightside up and stretching his arms and legs out in a big unbothered yawn.


“....cancer?” Alyssa mumbled, her eyes still wide.


“He’s joking! The.. the ghost is just joking!” T.K. interrupted, patting Alyssa on the back and smiling. Inside she had filed this information away to ask privately about what the flying fuck he was saying here but god she hoped he was joking.


“Yeah, for sure.” Dips said without looking at either of them.


“Just tell her what you told me then, damnit! Now that she knows I’m not a nut she needs to know what’s going on too.” T.K. commanded, helping Alyssa over to the stool behind the counter and sitting her down. Alyssa simply stared a cold, hard stare that never left the ghost of Dips even for a second.


“Oh yeah, rad, for sure!” Dips perked up, bobbing up and down in the air like a fishing lure on the surface of the water. “I’ve been dead for like, a long time, right? Like, ten years at least, bro.”


“Going on 30.” T.K. interrupted.


“Yikes.” Dips muttered. “Anywhozle, I died in a car crash, right? Doesn’t really matter who was at fault, unimportant to the story. But the dude who was in the passenger seat survived, yeah? He got taken to a weirdo hospital and got straight up EXPERIMENTED on by some freaky deaky Island of Dr. Moreau ass surgeon dudes. I was totally set up to haunt this dude forever for not making me stop drinking Everclear straight out of the bottle earlier, right? I figured that was my unfinished business and all anyway, but this dude was like, GONE, bro. He looked like they had straight up grafted a bunch of gigantic tarantula parts onto him, it was sick as fuck dude. But not sick like a Pearl Jam concert, sick like a Chris Gaines concert, dude.”


There was a moment of silence in the room.


“What the FUCK is this guy even TALKING about?!” Alyssa screamed out, standing up and throwing her hands in the air. She began to wildly gesticulate as she spoke, “I think we’re BOTH fucking certifiable, T.K.! There’s no way a ghost just told me his friend got turned into a spider monster and then compared it to fucking Garth Brooks’ rock alter ego! I just can’t exist in a world where this is happening!”


“Yo, chill, dudette, I wouldn’t lie to you, bro. I got no real reason to anyway, what does a ghost even need that they’d lie for?” Dips said reassuringly, hands outstretched to appease.


“...that weirdly kinda makes sense.” Alyssa said, sitting back down on the stool.


T.K. stayed perfectly quiet, shocked to her core that that had somehow worked to calm her down and not wanting to undo it by accident. She just chalked it up to author laziness and/or a limited page count and moved on.


“Anyway, before I was so rudely interrupted…” Dips continued, causing both women to glare at him instantly. “I floated around that place for a while, trynna find some way out of it, but it went on FOREVER, dude. There were all KINDA freaky shit happenin’ down there man, like fully Eyes Wide Shut style except without all the cumming, dude. I’ve watched movies as a ghost if that’s not something a dude who died in 1997 should be able to reference btw.” He interjected in case some fucking smart ass was listening who was checking dates on me, I mean him.


“Eventually I remembered ghosts can go up and just like Y-axis’d my way outta that bitch. I came up in the middle of nowhere and just kinda wandered the earth as any untethered soul without purpose might. I thought a few times about how I totally betrayed my best friend for seemingly straight up no reason and he went to prison for life for a murder he didn’t commit and how that might be my unfinished business to make up for that but like… that’s probably not it.”


Both women exchanged pained glances.


“But for real dudes, that’s what was killin’ people around town the past little while, bro. It was one of their fucked up weirdo monsters, dude.” Dips finally got to his fucking point.


“We… we need to get the hell out of this town then.” Alyssa said with the steel returned to her voice. She stood up and hurried back to behind the counter again, leaning down to the floor and returning with a fully loaded shotgun in her hands, causing both T.K. and Dips to recoil away from her hard.


“Isn’t this a fuckin’ FLOWER SHOP, DUDE?” Dips yelled out, eyes wide.


“When the hell did you even GET that?!” T.K. shouted as well, backing away.


“It belonged to my uncle.” she shrugged, pulling a duffle bag out from under the counter as well and stuffing the shotgun into it. “I just always saw on movies and tv that shop owners had shotguns. Are we not supposed to have one? I thought that was a thing. Apu had a shotgun.”


“Whoa, The Simpsons is still on? What the fuck, dude did they just stop making new shows?” Dips questioned.


“Uh…well…” Alyssa started to speak.


T.K. suddenly felt a sudden intense thought pulling at the back of her mind. A thought that was unformed and hazy, but had a drive and a purpose behind it. She rubbed at her temple for a moment, trying to figure out whether or not she should follow her instincts again after last night. But she finally gave in. “I’ve gotta go back to my apartment, then. I’ll pack a bag and we’ll go somewhere safe for a while.”


“We can go to my uncle’s place in Whitesville.” Alyssa said. “He’s like a weirdo religious nut and a gringo but he’s got a pretty big place with a guest house he’s always inviting me up to. May as well take the offer when there’s nowhere else to go.”


“Whitesville sounds kinda familiar for some reason…” Dips said to no one paying attention. 

Which was fucking WILD when you consider he’s a fucking GHOST, dude. Like how in the fuck could you possibly not be focusing every second on proof that ghosts are real, especially when you JUST found out. Oh well.


“I’ll go with you.” Alyssa volunteered, throwing the duffel bag over her shoulder.


“No… no.” T.K. said reassuringly, every fiber of her being screaming at her to not have Alyssa come along with her for some reason. 


“Oh uh… well… if you’re sure.” Alyssa said, shoving one hand into her jacket pocket. “I’ll head back to my place and get my stuff together, pick up the car, and swing back around here. I’ll pick you up when you get back and we’ll fuck off out of Monsterland.”


—----------

TK had walked for fifteen or twenty minutes and had almost arrived at her apartment complex before she had realized that Dips was following her. It was a lot harder to make out his ghostly form in the bright light of day outside, but the unmistakable ‘dudes’ and ‘brahs’ that floated on the air were enough to give her the idea she wasn’t alone.


“Why didn’t you let me know you were coming along?” TK stopped and spoke in the general direction she felt the vibe of Dips coming from. She tried to mask her movements doing this so no one on the street called the cops on a local loonie chatting herself up.


“Sorry brah, I’m not like… used to people knowing I exist and stuff?” Dips returned, his voice the only material of his being in the daylight.


“That’s… fair enough, I guess.” T.K. stared at the ground for a second, contemplating the absurdity of her life right now, then turned and crossed the street back to her building.


She pressed the padlock code on the front door and pushed the heavy metal door open, stepping around it and inside to let it click back into place behind her with a reverberating steel clang. 


When she turned around to continue on, however, the barrel of a submachine gun met her face.


She let out a startled yelp, and threw her hands up into the air, her eyes wide and her mouth agape. Standing in the middle of the foyer to the building were four men in bulletproof vests, each wearing a tinted gas mask over their face and pointing submachine guns at her in a semi-circle. She shook violently as the fear pulsated through her body, but not one of them made a move or said a word.


“You’ve been difficult to track, little girl.” a haggard old voice filtered around the men with guns. The two of them in the middle of the ground then took quick steps to the side, stopping once they had cleared the way. Their movement revealed a short old woman standing in the middle of the room, her hands tucked neatly together in front of her, her beady eyes glaring from behind coke-bottle lenses of heavy old round glasses, and her long gray hair piled up in a beehive hairdo atop her head.


TK remained perfectly still and quiet, staring down in disbelief at this weird old stranger. The woman was wearing a fur-collared long jacket over a silken blouse and a pair of perfectly tailored slacks, looking like a millionaire, which made her look all the more out of place standing in the middle of the dirty doorway of her cheap old apartment building.


“Oh don’t be shy now, missy.” the old woman chuckled, a strange golden haze slowly dribbling out of the edges of her mouth as if she had been smoking a moment before, but no cigarette appeared on her. “You obliterated the escaped experiment and half a block of buildings along with it and we’d never even heard of you before. You’re a brand new rising star in our little world. You may as well bask in the glory while you still can.”


“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” T.K. blurted out, trying to bluff. Her heart was beating a million miles a second in her chest.


“Queen Bee.” one of the masked men interrupted, holding a walkie talkie in his hand and lowering his gun.


“Oh what is it now?” the old woman spat out, aggravation coating her words.


“The police garrison reports an RV crashed through the roadblock at the edge of town a few minutes ago. Two officers are down. They have one of the suspects in custody who was flung from the impact but the other managed to re-enter the vehicle and get away. White male,six feet, red hair, blue jean jacket, still on the loose in Kirby city limits.” The masked man reported without inflection. TK starred wide-eyed wondering what the fuck they were even talking about because she hadn’t ever listened to this podcast before.


“Unfortunate, but not unforeseen. Continue hunting. He’s seen too much already. Take the wretched little detective into custody, maybe he knows something.” the old lady turned back to TK and smiled a wretched old smile which showed her yellowed, aged teeth too well for comfort. 


“Pardon the intrusion. And before I’d even properly introduced myself as well! As you heard, they call me Queen Bee. Believe it or not you’ve been paying me rent to live here for years! I own about half the buildings in this town. And pretty much every building in the surrounding towns. That’s exactly how I got the name, after all.” She chuckled ruefully to herself. “Gestalt has tasked me with capturing you alive, so as long as you don’t do anything youthful and stupid, you’ll live to see another day today. Now–”


But before she had the chance to continue her tirade, a glowing blue ghostly arm jutted down directly into the top of her head, causing her eyes to widen and go blank and her entire body to begin convulsing violently. Dips fished around inside of her skull with one eye closed and his tongue hanging out of his mouth in concentration, searching for something.


“Pretty sure they put the controls in here somewhere, my dude…” Dips muttered to himself. TK stared, wide-eyed and in disbelief.


Each of the four gas-masked soldiers dropped their guns and stared as well, watching as Queen Bee jerked her arms in the air, and moaned out rueful, painful groans as the unseen assailant routed around in her skull. They exchanged worried, fearful glances frantically back and forth with each other.


“Oh god…” TK muttered under her breath, her breathing becoming more and more erratic and raspy with each inhale. Her entire body was shaking, and the fear in her threatened to rip her apart and drop her to the ground at any moment. A familiar wave of emotion washed over her, hard and fast, like the crest of a wave slamming into her body that she had no hope of fighting against the current in.


The four armed men turned back toward TK all at once, but they were all too late. She had thrown her head back and let out a loud, piercing scream, and when she returned her eyes onto them they were pitch black and depthless. They tried to raise their guns, but each gun flew from their hands the instant before they could level it, crunching into useless hunks of steel as they embedded themselves into the concrete walls around the foyer and splintering into a million pieces as they hit the floor. 


“RUN!!” one of the men screamed, but again, it was far too late. T.K. screamed loud and clarion clear, the sound reverberating off of the walls like an echo chamber but a thousand times louder, and never diminishing in intensity. A wave of violent, hateful force burst forth from her body outward, the edge of which swept everyone else in the room up with it and pancaked them against the stone walls with enough force that their bodies liquified on contact, sending showers of blood and viscera up and down each wall as if painting them purposefully.


TK blinked. She had felt all of it, but had lived none of it. The sudden sight of the insides of four human beings painting the walls around her caused her stomach to twist in hideous revulsion, and she would have thrown up there and then had it not been for the fear which gripped her once more.


Standing in the middle of the room, surrounded by the smeared flesh of Queen Bee, torn and sundered from her body just as it had been from everyone else, was a quivering mass of insectoid limbs and wings, mandibles chittering and black segmented eyes opening to the light.


Dips floated back away from it, his own eyes wide and shaking with a fear he hadn’t felt since that long night underground the day he had died. The monsters had found him.


The thing unfurled its massive translucent wings, filling up the entire foyer as it raised up on twisted humanoid limbs which looked to be made of raw sinew and blood which dipped onto the floor, sizzling the linoleum with each drop. The massive, half-human, half-wasp creature drew its head back and opened its maw of mandibles, screeching an unholy, deafening screech which blew each window out of the first floor of the building like they were nothing.


From within the thing’s slavering maw came a heaving, thick cloud of miasma which rolled out and across the floor like an over-active smoke machine, filling the room up with a golden dusty haze which choked at T.K.’s lungs almost immediately, causing the room to swirl and move all its own around her. She tried to turn and run but she stumbled and had to grasp onto the door handle behind her just to stay on her feet.


Thankfully, the massive insectoid horror turned its lidless segmented eyes toward Dips suddenly, as if it had instantly registered in its changed state that ghosts now existed and was pretty fucking shocked about that, as bee emotions go. 


TK took the opportunity to wrench the door open and stumble out into the street in front of her building, choking and gasping in lungfuls of clean air as she fell into the middle of the street. She pressed into the concrete below her and tried to regain her footing but she couldn’t stand, her entire body feeling numbed by the mist.


She turned over and looked up into the air, finding herself staring eye to eye with the 6th grader from Apartment 3-B that had always played his fucking trombone too loud too late into the evening for her taste for the past two years. He even had the godamn trombone now and placed the end to his mouth and aimed the horn down at T.K. and began to toot away at it with a shitty grin barely visible around the mouthpiece.


“F…for fuck’s… sake…” T.K. managed to mouth out between loud farty toots on the trombone right in her face.


BOOOOOOOOOM!!


The entire front of the first floor of the apartment building exploded outward, sending bricks and mortar and stone flying in every direction and pressing out enough force into the street to send cars along the sidewalk to go flying, along with T.K. and the shitty little trombone boy.


Thankfully, depending on how you look at it, the trombone boy landed in a bush across the street in front of a different apartment building, along with his intact trombone. T.K. shared a pretty similar fate, landing face-first into a hedge along the sidewalk not far away, narrowly missing a car which flew by and embedded itself into the front of the Krispy Kreme donuts across the street.


Girders lined the street along with huge chunks of stone and broken pieces of mortar and glass. People screamed inside of the apartment buildings and the few open shops along the street loud enough to fill up the morning air even outside. But none of that stopped the hideous twisted creature from crawling out into the light of day, its body steadily exuding its noxious miasma into the air with every chittering step.


“N-no…” T.K. managed to squeak out, crawling from the bush onto the concrete and trying her hardest to pick herself up off the ground to seemingly no avail. 


“Yo this is for SURE harshing my mellow, bro!” Dips screamed out, floating up into the air above all of the destruction below him. “I can’t do anything, brah, I’m totally incorporeal and whatnot!”


“Fuck…! FUCK!” T.K. screamed, trying and failing to stand up over and over, her legs just not responding to her thanks to the several lung-fuls of the wasp’s strange miasma she had inhaled while trapped inside of the building. 


The insectoid horror for its part, climbed up onto the bushes behind where T.K. lay and turned itself around, a three feet long bladed stinger erupting out of its back and steady aiming itself directly at T.K. head below it.


Dips thought for a moment, frantically looking around for literally anything he could do to help. He finally noticed the little shitty trombone kid getting out of the tangle of bushes he’d been plopped into along with his farty brass instrument and realized exactly what he could do. Though he’d only seen it done by ghosts in movies and TV shows before.


He dove, like a bolt of unearthly lightning, down and down out of the sky, until his elongated bolt of a body struck the little shitty trombone kid and his very essence, everything that is Dips, was embedded inside of him, overwriting his shitty trombone personality with his own in its place.


Little shitty trombone boy blinked. Or rather, Dips blinked. He’d done it! He tried to take a step, and fell face-first into the concrete, sending his trombone bouncing back into the bush off of it.


“Fuck, pain sucks dick, I forgot…” he muttered to himself in his little shitty trombone boy voice. He quickly stumbled and fumbled back up to his feet and yanked the trombone out of the leafy prison he’d sent it to, placed it to his mouth, and let out a loud, farty, explosive call on it that filled up the entire street with it’s tinny old unpolished noise.


The sound was meant to catch the wasp monster’s attention and keep it from doing its horrid deed, which it did. Queen Bee turned her horrid gaze from T.K. toward the little boy immediately, confusion upon its features as much as it was capable. 


But it did something more than was expected by anyone there.


T.K. had spent so many sleepless evenings listening to that little talentless fucker bleet on his stupid mishapen fuck tube. So many attempts at trying to relax and listen to some music absolutely ruined by repeated farting attempts to play Baa Baa Black Sheep and not make it sound like someone in the building had a particularly resonant toilet bowl after a hearty Taco Tuesday dinner. The danger of the situation, the resonant memories of hatred and desire for violence, the necessity of saving her own life as well as the life of a shitty trombone child who she hated with a burning violence she was deeply ashamed of - those things combined triggered it all over again.


Her body broke the bounds of gravity all at once, rising up and off of the ground like a puppet pulled up by its strings into the air above all of it. Her legs and arms dangled and she hung her head as she ascended, the dull droning sound emanating from her drowning out both the bleating of the trombone and the buzzing of the monstrosity. 


She raised her head, black, empty eyes in her sockets staring down at the hideous creature that infested the street below her. 


The monster turned its chittering face filled with bulbous eyes and human teeth back up toward T.K. as she floated in the air, letting out a loud, deafening screech of its own before leaping up into the air at her, unfurled wings beginning to hum and beat into the air for liftoff. 


But it would not make it to its prey. As if hundreds of puppet strings began to pull them up into the air, the jagged stone and metal girders of her apartment building’s first floor that littered the streets around them were jerked up into the air and leveled from a hundred different directions at a single prey. 


The creature drew its clawed hand back and threw it outward in a vain attempt to rip T.K. apart to stop it’s oncoming demise, but as had her foes been several times this day, it was far too late. Each and every piece of shrapnel the beast had created when it leapt into the street fired off like missiles from their silos at high speed and pierced into the wasp creature like a pincushion from every direction imaginable. There was a moment where everything was still in the air, and no sound permeated the wind at all… and then the heap of unliving, pulped flesh that used to be Queen Bee fell to the ground in a lump, espousing rivers of blood from its semi-solid remains. 


TK slowly floated back down to the ground, and landed on the soles of her boots as if placed there by unseen hands. The black filtered from her sclera like oil washing down the drown, revealing her bright brown eyes in their place, and the shaking fear behind them at what she had done. 


She darted her vision around to see who had seen her. Faces pressed into every in tact window left in the street and some shattered and broken ones. Some of them held phones to their ear, some of them holding phones up to their windows recording. Her heartbeat was threatening to burst from her chest, and she felt that same strange, destructive force begin to well up uncontrollably within her again, the force swirling out from her without her say-so.


“Whoa, holy fuckin’ shit, dude, you’re totally radical!” Dips screamed out, floating around her in a wide circle and clapping and throwing up devil horns over and over. “You told me you had a weird power but holy shit, brah, that’s wild AND crazy, kid!”


The power and rage flowed away from T.K. and she sighed a heaving, painful sigh, stumbling back a few steps. “Y-Yeah… ok…” She paused for a moment and then began to jog back across the street toward her building. 


“Where are you goin, bro?!” Dips called away, floating after her as best as he could manage.


T.K. ran into the rubble of the first floor toward the back of the ruined foyer, then into the stairwell. She took the stairs two by two, heaving breaths escaping her as she pushed herself up to the third floor. Through the door, into the hallway, down the hall, and straight up to 3-G, her apartment she had lived in for several years now. Ever since she and Alyssa…

She couldn’t think about that now. Oh god, she couldn’t know what emotion could trigger another outburst. What could cause her to just go off like a bomb at any second. She breathed hard and fast as she fumbled with her keys to open the door. And when she did?


Her apartment was behind it, just as she had left it. It was far enough back into the building that the front of the first floor being blown out hadn’t affected it much. A bunch of her stuff that had been on tables and shelves was strewn across the floor, but that was it. 


She took a moment to breathe. It was hard, her lungs hurt a lot.


From the corner of her eye she noticed a framed photo face-down on the ground near the windowsill. She walked over and knelt down next to it, slowly picking it up with both hands turning it over to face her. In the broken photo two bright smiling faces, pressed into each other cheek to cheek, beamed back at her. Alyssa’s and her own. They were wearing New Years Eve dresses and had pulled their feathery party masks back for the picture, both of them holding champagne glasses up in a toast in front of them. 


T.K. smiled a small, pained smile, and sat the photo back up on the table next to the window where it had been, and sat for a moment staring at it. The welling feeling within her that she would explode was completely gone now.


She peered from the corner of her eyes at the window. She swallowed and leaned her head out of it, the glass completely gone just like most other windows in the building. The pulped corpse of the horrific creature was exactly where she had left it down the street at the front of the building, pressed against the sidewall across the street and filled with so much debris and rubble as to be next to impossible to identify as something that had once been living.


But there was a man standing in front of it now. He stood silently, hands in the pockets of a long black overcoat, his wild, curly black hair flowing in the breeze as he took it in. He was studying the corpse without a hint of fear or timidity. As a matter of fact, the calm he was exuding was so unnatural as to cause the hairs on the back of T.K.’s neck to stand up at the sight.


And just as she leaned a little further out the window to try and see the man better… he whipped his head around in her direction almost instantly, his dark eyes narrowing to clear the distance between them as if he had heard her near-silent movements.


She ducked back into the window and yanked her body away from it, leaning her back against an overturned chair nearby and heaving frightened breaths in and out of her lungs. He couldn’t have known she was looking at him, could he…? She was seven apartments back into the building after all.


She crawled back over to the window, and slowly, apprehensively, peered back out into the street. The corpse of her former attacker was still there, slowly pouring black and purple viscous liquid out into the street, but the man in the black overcoat… was gone without a trace.


“What now?” the voice of Dips completely shattered the silence of the situation, causing T.K. to jump high as fuck into the air from the sheer terror of his intrusion. 


“FUCK!!” she screamed out, turning around and drawing her hand back to slap the shit out of him for his dumb intrusion, but then remembering he’s a ghost and you can’t do that shit. “For fuck’s sakes man…”


“Oh uh… sorry, bro.” he offered sincerely, offering an apologetic smile.


“What’s next is… I pack and we get the fuck out of here before the cops show up. …or whoever the hell those people were show up again.” T.K. jumped to her feet and began frantically running from room to room of the apartment, shoving things into a backpack she yanked up from beside the bedroom door.


“Oh cause you’re like a super duper serial killer now, totally, I get it.” Dips said casually, fake-leaning against an overturned chair with his legs floating in the air, since he can’t touch anything.


T.K. froze immediately. The sudden realization she’d killed like six people now hitting her like a freight train. Well… six “people” in quotation marks. Not like… racially, they were like monsters and shit. That was also not racially. You fucking know what she meant.


“...Maybe we uh… we hold off on telling Alyssa about this…?” TK muttered.


“Goooootcha, bro.Who am I gonna tell anyway?” Dips said with a biiiig wink to the camera.


THE END


P.S. The shitty little trombone kid took up the cello and was way better at it. He also lived happily ever after or whatever and didn’t get cancer, whatever you gotta hear to sleep at night.
