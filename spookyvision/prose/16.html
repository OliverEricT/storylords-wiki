The Rebirth of Ryo

By Jeff Pennington

Prompts: Gauntlets & Meteors

The brilliant golden hues of sunset flitted through the large segmented wall of windows in Room 4-C, the Chemistry Lab at The Henderson University for the Especially Big-Brained, a fully accredited school, you can look it up, but you’re probably not spelling it right that’s why it’s coming back with no results or news pages about completely frivolous and unfounded lawsuits. About a different school. That’s spelled different.

Anywho, at the current moment only two people were occupying the state-of-the-art, 0 injuries to the eyeballs of a student since January 28th Chemistry Lab - and one of them was tapping a marker against an equation on the board with a little more fervor than one would think was necessary.

“COME ON you can get this! A fourth grader with a face tattoo could figure out this equation and still have time to hit the crack pipe before gym!” the tall man with a flowing black mane of hair yelled, stabbing the marker even harder at the equation on the board. This grumpy gus with a frown that needed turning upside down was Ryo Tachibana, struggling post-graduate teacher’s assistant to the blowhard who usually occupied this classroom, Professor Tomblinson.

Twenty five, with piercing eyes, a strong jaw, and the kind of body you could bounce a quarter off of ANYwhere - yes even his eye was muscular as fuck, don’t even fucking doubt me - it was no wonder the other current tenant of the room was having trouble concentrating.

“Well damn, Ryo, give me a break! I just woke up at this school with amnesia a few days ago!” Hallie Swiftfeather said with a shake of her head. It was true that she had been found unconscious wearing some kind of LARP outfit outside of Peenerman Hall and now she was just trying to finish her bachelors and get back to her regular life. Some kind of Renn Fest worker of some kind, she assumed.

“Just use a fucking calculator then, god damnit!” Ryo seethed, throwing the marker as hard as he could at the board and causing it to ricochet off and land perfectly back in the pen cup on top of Professor Tomblinson’s desk.

“NO!!” Hallie screamed out way too loud, recoiling away. “I… I won’t use technology. Not anymore.” she whispered in a hushed voice to herself, drawing her knees up to her chest in the chair she was sitting in and staring into the middle distance.

Ryo stared for a moment at her near comatose state then shrugged. “Alright, well, give it the ol’ college try yourself then. You got this!” he said, far too chipper for someone who both just lost his shit about a math problem at an amnesiac and then watched that same amnesiac have some kind of fucked up breakdown.

“Okie-dokie!” Hallie snapped back to normal, hopping up from her seat and walking over to the board. She picked up a marker and began to quickly write into the blanks in the beginning, middle, and end to finish the equation for the perfect arrangement of elements and chemicals to answer the question. When she was finished she smiled widely, and placed the marker down with a loud snap, beaming proud.

Ryo looked over it and turned his head slowly back to her, a wide smile on his slowly reddening face, veins beginning to pop from his neck, and his whole body beginning to shake. “Well that’s a good answer, Hallie, but I’m afraid it’s WWWRRRROOONNNGGGG!!!”

The force of his scream sent Hallie flying back into her chair like a cartoon character head-over-heels, slamming into it and causing it to spin cause it was one of those roly-poly chairs that office stories just fucking give away to colleges I guess cause them shits break constantly there’s no way a college is paying for any kind of quality outside their football stadium.

“Oh.” Hallie said, straightening her jacket and standing back up. “Somethin’ bothering you, Ryo? You’re usually at like an 11 in bubbling rage just beneath the surface but you’re peaking around 50 today. You shrink your undies at the Landro-Rama again?”

“No, no…well yeah. But fuck man…” Ryo stepped to the window and stared out into the blinding bright light of the golden hour, his retina singed but his stare absolute. “I’ve been stuck at this dead-end teaching assistant job for two years now. I wanna be out there…in the real chemistry world! Doing real chemistry things! Making a difference! …for chemistry!”

“I don’t know what that means.” Hallie said, shoving her hands into her pockets and rocking back and forth on her heels awkwardly. “But uh… you’ll get there.”

Ryo turned dramatically from the window, drawing his arm up over his forehead in the universal pose called ‘woe is me’. “No, Hallie… you don’t understand.”

“I just said that.” Hallie cut him off.

He lowered his arm and side-eyed her viciously for a moment before raising his arm back over his eyes and continuing, “I can’t escape this place. I don’t… MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO QUIT!” he threw his arm down into a rageful clenched fist at that last bit.

Hallie slurped at her 7-11 Slurpee, now available in Bahama Twist or some shit go check it out, and glanced up at the clock on the wall. “OH! Hey, are you gonna watch the meteor showed up on Hobbs Knobb tonight with everybody? A lot of the staff and freaks who have no friends due to bad personality and/or Amnesia are gonna be there.”

Ryo turned back to her and stopped clenching his fist. “Oh is that tonight? I’d forgotten about it, I guess. Huh…”

“C’mon!” Hallie encouraged, “You and I can spend some quality time together. I’m pretty sure I probably liked guys? I guess? To be honest with you I have no fucking clue so this could get REAL awkward for the both of us, but you gotta learn somehow, right?” she took another sip of her Slurpee.

“Yeah… yeah, sure. I’m tired of being some kind of mix of furious to the point of blindness and melancholy to the point of theatrics. Maybe a little stargazing will make me feel better.” Ryo tried to smile but it came out as a frown.

“Tragic.” Hallie said upon seeing that, shaking her head and sipping her slurpee. “I’ll see you there.”

Ryo waved after her as she left, taking a moment to release a sigh. God this job fucking sucked. He erased the board, put up the markers, and straightened the desks, finally pulling the blinds closed as his final menial task for the day.

He plopped down into a student desk and propped his feet up on the one adjacent from it, slipping his phone from his pants pocket and beginning his nightly ritual of searching for a job that doesn’t blow shit that was within 5000 miles of his current location that he was remotely qualified for. He knew he’d never find anything, but it was better than swan-diving off the roof of the parking garage. For now.

A few moments of blissful silence passed before the sound of heavy, leaden footsteps began to echo up the hallway outside. Ryo peered up over the top of his phone toward the shut door of the chemistry lab across from him for a second or two but then turned his eyes back to the screen. There was a position for a human guinea pig at Monsanto that sounded somewhat better than his current gig he was eyeballing when he noticed the sound of the steps had stopped.

He peered back up over the phone and looked through the brownish opaque glass of the door. He squinted slightly to try to make out any kind of shape through it but couldn’t, as the lights in the hallway had been turned off by this point - classes had been over for several hours. Normal people with real lives had long gone.

He shook his head and looked back at his phone. Another moment of silence passed before there was a strange noise in the hallway, a slight distance from the door it seemed like, though Ryo had never heard anything like it in his life. It was a thick liquidy sound that gurgled off into silence and it set every hair on his body upright. He stood up from his desk and shoved his phone back into his pocket, tilting his head a little as he slowly walked toward the door.

Every few steps he took, the sound repeated, louder, or wetter, or softer, or with much more gurgle. Sounds that made his skin crawl and his stomach turn, but he couldn’t place them for the life of him. His hand trembled as he reached for the door handle, but another loud, metallic clanging sound caused him to recoil, even stepping back away instinctively.

He gritted his teeth and grasped the door handle firmly, his eyes darting up from his hand to the murky brown opaque glass of the door once more… only to be met with a face pressed against it staring back at him with gaping wide eyes.

He jolted back away from the door, his body falling onto the floor and sending the coat-rack by the entrance clattering against the linoleum behind him. He wanted to scream, but nothing came out of his mouth at all except gasping, raspy breaths.

Then he felt incredibly stupid. The face staring at him blank-eyed through the door was Hallie, her tongue hanging out in a mocking gesture. Her face pulled away from the door and disappeared into the darkness of the hall and Ryo gritted his teeth and growled out the angriest, most vicious growl he could manage. “YOU FUCKING NO-MEMORY HAVING BITCH!”

He ran to the door and yanked it open with all his might, revealing… an empty hallway outside. He looked down one way and saw nothing, then threw his head in the other, watching a small scrap of brown leather disappear around a corner, like a belt being dragged on the floor. He grimaced, taking two steps back into the chemistry lab to pick his leather jacket up off the floor and sling it onto his shoulders before giving chase.

Turning the corner he was suddenly blinded again by the brilliant golden sunset at the other end of the hallway, glistening through the gigantic bay windows set there. He threw his hand up in front of his face and peered through his fingers, seeing the blurry outline of some sort of man standing at the other hand of the hall, holding something in his left hand.

“Omedetō gozaimasu (oh-may-day-to), Tachibana Ryo-kun!” a deep Japanese voice filled up the hallway, echoing off of the lockers and glass cases that lined it like a bullet ricochets off steel.

“I’m from New Jersey, you fuck! I don’t speak Japanese!” Ryo screamed back, half out of reflex dealing with weaboos and anime junkies on campus more than anything.

“Congratulations, Little Ryo… you have been chosen. Chosen by the omnipotent GESTALT! ” the voice spoke in clear, impassioned English, a slight lilt of laughter at the end of its call.

By now Ryo had adjusted to the onslaught of light but was still having trouble believing his eyes. At the end of the halfway in front of him stood an extremely tall man in an overcoat with jagged holes torn through it in a half dozen places - not empty and dangling holes, no.. they were each filled and jutted out beyond by long, thick, hairy spiders legs, which ended in spiked tips, each one slowly waving around in the air around the man’s body as he stood stock-still in between.

Ryo could barely move, his entire body wracked with wave after wave of debilitating horror which threatened to leave him completely catatonic. He couldn’t speak, his eyes searching around frantically for any sign of artifice in this thing before him - any clue that this could be fake. Any seam, any wire, any pulley or servo, ANYTHING to make the nightmarish feeling in his veins finally end.

The thing at the end of the hallway opened its left hand and dropped its contents, which plopped sickening against the floor and rolled a few feet toward Ryo. His shaking could barely be contained long enough for him to take his eyes off the horror before him, but he instinctively glanced down at what had been dropped. There on the floor… eyes wide just as before and tongue rolled out in a mocking droop, was Hallie Swiftfeather’s head, blood oozing from the neck onto the linoleum hallway floor.

That’s right, I fucking killed her in this universe too. God damn.

Ryo finally screamed, and turned on his heels to run away as fast as he possibly could, his Adidas squeaking against the floor with every push faster and faster away.

The things elongated, inhuman tongue rolled out of its mouth and across it’s face to lap up a bit of blood that remained from it’s victim, and then with horrific speed, exploded off of the floor into the air toward Ryo’s flight - it’s gigantic spider legs stabbing into the walls, lockers, and doors as it propelled itself down the corridor, the human body in the middle dangling almost lifelessly being dragged behind.

Ryo ran as hard and as fast as he could, every muscle in his body working as hard as they possibly could to propel him, but the horrific thing was on him within seconds anyway. He tried to struggle, throwing his fists back at it as it came upon him, but the spider’s legs pinned him down to the ground all at once, like daggers piercing into his flesh and through him entirely, even piercing the hall floor below him. He screamed harder and louder than he could have ever even imagined himself capable of, but no one heard.

Only the humanoid body at the center of the monster could hear, and smiled widely from ear to ear, the smiling slit opening up to reveal a set of dripping mandibles within that reached out toward his face and rubbed against his cheek, leaving behind a burning viscous ooze that cause him to scream out in pain once more.

“No… mustn’t feed again… you have been chosen, Little Ryo… you will be Gestalt…” the body revealed its right arm finally, a gauntlet slid overtop of the tattered overcoat on it, glistening in silver and black tones. Each finger at the end of the gauntlet had a long silver needle protruding from the tip, and each first knuckle lead up to a metal outlet wherein a tube of thick purple liquid sputtered and spun all its own within. The creature clicked its mandibles and laughed to itself, “This will hurt so very much…”

Ryo felt five needles pass through his flesh, and a seering white hot pain that he could not even quantify, and then nothing.

_______________________

An eternity passed for Ryo that he’ll never remember again. But for those agonizing moments, those hours of torture he suffered that night, he will be thankful to not remember, if nothing else.

The changes that the injections made to his body weren’t satisfactory to the dark room of scientists and surgeons that surrounded him in the haze of his consciousness. His muscles strained, stretched and hardened, his skin peeling away from his body to reveal carapace and chitin, but each one of them repeated through the pain which seared his every nerve ending “This one is special. We can go further.”

Their instruments tore at him and pushed within him, and changed him beyond anything he could imagine, but through the darkness and the violence he stared up unblinkingly to the sky so very far above. He saw them.. The meteors streaking through the sky. The comet which had birthed them swinging past our world and continuing into the great unknown beyond it. The red rays which it left in its wake showed over him in his hour of most need and everything went black again. No pain found him any longer as they worked.

“Please wake up…” a voice pleaded in the darkness and Ryo stirred, not knowing where his mind resided any longer. “Please.. We have to hurry! They’re going to be here soon!”

Blearily he opened his eyes, his entire body weak and sore, but as he looked down at it… fully human. His own skin, his own muscles, his own hands. They were bruised, they were covered in stitches and incisions, but this was his own body. He would have rejoiced if he could have found even the slightest bit of energy left in him.

“You have to wake up, Ryo…” the voice came again, and Ryo turned his eyes to the side to see… Professor Tomblinson? The chemistry professor he worked with at the college? He shook his head and rubbed at his eyes, looking once more.

“Ryo, we must go NOW. They know I’ve let you free! We have to get out of here!” Professor Tomblinson shook at Ryo’s shoulders, his frail old form working overtime to push against him.

“Where…. Why?” Ryo managed to finally sputter out, but Tomblinson had pushed him up to his feet at this point. The floor was metal, and cold. It took him a moment to realize he was wearing nothing but a hospital gown now. The room around him was so dark, but he could barely make out strange machinery in the dim light, and stadium seating that surrounded the operating table he was just laying on… which he only noticed now was covered with deep red spatters of blood. His own blood.

“GO! We must HURRY!” Tomblinson sputtered out, but a set of double doors at the other end of the room flung open and two men in surgeons scrubs stepped inside, screaming in some language that Ryo couldn’t identify. But only for a moment, as Tomblinson reached into his lab coat and pulled out a fucking gun and shot both of them fucking dead, holy fucking shit.

Ryo suddenly followed Tomblinson’s orders a little more adeptly, trying to run but mostly stumbling toward the other set of doors. He could barely focus on what was happening, but he could hear during their flight down the long and winding corridors of this strange place that Professor Tomblinson was apologizing over and over again, his voice cracking with emotion. Ryo couldn’t think to even respond, he could only run.

________________

The next thing he remembered he was laying against a tree near a body of water. He turned his head over to his side to see Professor Tomblinson sitting next to a small fire, his hands gripping onto his lab coat to hold it tighter around himself. It must have been cold, Ryo thought to himself. Why couldn’t he feel it?

“Oh… oh! You’re awake! That’s good… that’s… that’s good.” Tomblinson said absently, picking up a stick and poking at the fire with it. “We’re on the other side of the island. I don’t think they know. I’ve arranged for a boat to be left down by the docks a little ways from here. It’s best to travel in the light though… they can… they can see better than us in the dark.”

“I don’t…” Ryo swallowed hard, finding no moisture in his mouth to speak with. He cough once or twice, then began again, “I don’t understand… what’s happening…”

“I… I’m sorry, Ryo. They told me if I didn’t find them a suitable candidate then they would kill me. They told me I wasn’t strong enough… didn’t have the vision to be one of them. I tried to… to prove myself. But they were right… I don’t have the stomach to be a member. I don’t lack the humanity necessary to commit the atrocities they commit.” Tomblinson threw the stick into the fire and tightened the labcoat up around his shoulders.

“Look you have to admit that you’re kind of an annoying little fuck, right? Like we give you a job that’s barely above minimum wage with no benefits, you’re supposed to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, you know? Not blame everyone else but yourself. The system worked fine for me. I got this job when I was your age and now I’ve got tenure it’s just like… grow the fuck up, y’know? Stop being such a millennial baby and invest in something or whatever I did to get money, I don’t remember. My parents gave me a little bit, like a mil or something, but everything else I made myself!” The Professor paused for a moment and then adjusted his tie, “Anyway… they will be looking for us now… we have to lay low.”

“They? Who are…. What did they do to me, Professor? What did they DO TO ME?!” Ryo began to panic, sitting up from the tree and raising his voice.

The professor held his hands out to try and calm him down, “No, they’ll hear you! You must not yell!”

But it was too late. From the darkness between the trees came a shadow, a long tall thing with leathery wings that swooped from inside like a bullet and clasped its gigantic curled talons around Professor Tomblinson’s shoulders and yanked his body up into the air. The Professor screamed at the top of his lungs as the talons dug into his body and he disappeared into the darkness beyond the fire.

Ryo shot up to his feet, his entire body pulsing and aching suddenly in a way he had never felt before. Like something was pushing against his skin to escape.

Slowly the fire began to illuminate long, spindly spiders legs, each one the size of three grown men, that crept up toward Ryo, stabbing into the ground with each step. The humanoid body that swung like a pendulum between the legs floated down the ground and stood where the Professor once sat, a wide inhuman smile across the entirety of its featureless face, save dozens of little pock-marks where tiny red eyes stared unblinkingly from.

“You have not finished your procedure yet, Little Ryo…” the voice hissed from inside the shell of a human body standing before him. His right hand drew around to his side, dangling the same mechanical gauntlet with needles and vials all over it into the light. “Perhaps you need another round of the serum to fully awaken…”

The thing lurched at Ryo like a bullet fired from a chamber, driving the gauntlet of needles toward his midsection with enough force to splinter concrete – but this time, Ryo’s hands were clasped onto it, holding it just at bay from his stomach with shaking hands that moved like lightning all their own.

“Oh…” the horrific spider man hummed, the gigantic smile on his smooth face opening once again to reveal the hideous wet mandibles within.

Ryo screamed, his voice loud and clear and his own for the first time this night, but it was supplanted so quickly that the fear could barely register in him at it. His voice blended into the screeching inhuman sound so perfectly that it almost didn’t register when he no longer sounded human anymore.

The thing that had been pushing at his skin finally found purchase and his body was ripped open from the inside, his hands exploding into bone and flesh, and in their place jagged, chitin-covered fingers which dug into the gauntlet and began to splinter it into hundreds of small pieces. In place of his screaming mouth, two mandibles of his own which released his screeching hatred just as well - a pair of segmented black eyes all his own staring back at the creature before him.

Every inch of him was replaced, supplanted, by something stronger, harder, less human - more insectoid. More violent and remorseless.

The creature that had once been Ryo drew the splintered remains of the spider monsters gauntlet up and jammed it into the inside of the humanoid face in the center, the needles piercing from the bottom of its jaw straight up through the top of its brain.

The spider creature screeched and fell back and away from Ryo’s new form, but the insectoid took no moments rest, throwing its chitinous arm out to it’s side and its forearm splitting right down the middle and apart with viscous green ooze flowing out like a fresh bloody wound. But a moment after a jagged blade slide from within the arm and sluiced out to its full length, twice the length of the arm that had bore it.

The spider horrors myriad legs lashed out at Ryo but he drew his blade through the air like a thresher and cleaved the legs apart at each joint, sending them flying in splatters of blood of sinew in every direction, leaving the spider to squeal and screech out in pain beyond human understanding.

Which was cut short as the curved mantis’ blade sunk deep into its chest and out its back, then swiped hard and fast straight up to bisect his entire torso in halves.

Both sides fell to the ground as the spider thing went limp, completely lifeless.

What was once Ryo reared his head back and screeched to the sky with bloodlust and rage filling its chest.

_____________________________

The morning sun was blinding, but only for a moment. The rocking of the boat beneath him was unnerving, but that too passed. By the time he finally set up and realized he was in the boat that Professor Tomblinson had arranged for both of their escape, he had acclimated just fine to the where… but the what was still confusing him.

He looked down at his hands… perfectly human. Not a scratch on them. He was completely naked at this point so it was easy to tell that everything was exactly as it had always been, down to the birthmark on his inner thigh.

Somehow he had made it through the night. Somehow the most horrific ordeal he’d ever lived through was over as suddenly as it began and he felt hollow, empty, and stunned.

The boat rolled with the waves in the middle of the lake, the town a blip in the distance passed the forest on the other side. He sat there, staring at his own hands, the sun beaming down upon him.

“What… am I now…?” he whispered to himself. He tried to ignore the taste of blood that filled his mouth as he thought.

_______________________________

Somewhere a line lit up, and the phone clicked to life. A female voice spoke. “The new subject has escaped. He far exceeded expectations but that limp dick extremely divorced boomer Professor Tomblinson’s interference means he never received the proper conditioning for use. You were right. His bloodline was the key to the next level.”

A male voice responded, “You have priority clearance to retrieve the subject. By absolutely any means necessary.”

In unison, both voices spoke, “Hail Gestalt.”

Then the line went dead.

THE END
