Home for the Hellidays (But Even Worse Than Usual)

Prompts: Cryptids & Passages

By Jeff Pennington


Excerpt from the final pages of a journal that was found inside a derelict car off Route 195 near Howell Township, West Virginia - dated December 1967.


I had been dreading coming home for the holidays since the moment I’d left from them last year. There had been an uproar in the area over the past few years that had seemingly put everyone in a foul mood but I had chalked it entirely up to local superstition and a lack of good television outside of Star Trek, The Ed Sullivan Show, and third example of famous television from this era. 


I really wish I had taken it all a little more seriously now. It’s kind’ve hard to explain now.


I arrived around 5pm on the 23rd, the old brick building in the middle of town that my family had lived in for four generations looming over me like a frail old grandfather extends his shadow over his grandchild to exert dominance just as his body is about to fail him.


It looked like a giant pile of shit still, is my point.


I parked my Ford Pinto, the most reliable and least-likely to explode car on the road one year running, at the end of the curve. If you don’t get the joke in that, do a quick google search about the Gremlin, it’s a banger bit, I swear to you. I mean a search in the Encylopedia or whatever.


I was kicking snow off my tires then so I didn’t notice my mother run out of the house and throw her arms around me, sending me sky high jumping out of my skin from the sudden impact.


“Don’t act like you don’t recognize your mother’s love!” she caterwauled directly into my ear in that thick West Virginian accent that I’d hoped to purge from my memory. I was embarrassed to think how soothing it was to hear in that moment, honestly.


“Hey ma.” I managed to squeeze out from beneath her heavyset frame dangling from my neck like a weight harangued about my throat. A familiar feeling for anyone who has an angry bitch for a mother. Hey, don’t fucking judge me for that, you’ll be agreeing with me soon, I bet! Just keep reading.


“That’s it?! That’s all I get as a hello?” She dropped from my neck like a menopausal stone and glared at me with a practiced judgemental look that from the outside seemed too cartoonish to be real, like she was only playing with me like a loving mother sometimes does, but I understood from a lifetime of it how real it could be. Not to mention the difference between a loving mother and my own. “I raised you up from a little baby in shitty diapers and I get a ‘Hey ma’ after not seeing you for a year?We dealt with the devil in these woods these long years to still have a happy home for you and that’s what I get?”


“Hey ma, I love you?” I chuckled out in return. She didn’t laugh. She never seemed to laugh, honestly. 


“And what’s this?” she grasped onto the end of my scarf and held it up to her eyes behind her extremely out of date glasses which dangled far down her nose. “You’re wearing this garbage when I sent you a new one last month for the winter? Where did you even get this?”


“My girlfriend made it for me, Ma. Her name’s Nancy.” I tugged the scarf back away from her and resettled my round frame glasses back on my face. She noticed the gesture and gave me another angry cartoon’s disapproving face - like Yosemite Sam before he pulled his six-shooters on Bugs Bunny. She hated me wearing those glasses, she said it made me look like John Lennon. That resemblance being exactly how I’d gotten Nancy to the crowded back seat of my Pinto meant that comparison no longer bothered me much.


“A girlfriend?! You have a girlfriend at college?” She took a step back away from me and placed her hand on her mouth. Now, you might be picturing a doting look of approval mixed with the realization she was losing her little boy on her proud features right then. But it was fear. Blind, hateful, fear.


She paused for a moment and I could watch the gears turn in her head. She was the scheming type, always one grand plan away from total domination of the social scene in town, or one clever trick away from getting exactly what she wanted out of other peoples’ lives. She was the puppetmaster and we were all dancing to her beat. 


“What’s this Nancy look like, hm?” she finally settled on her brilliant opening gambit. I suddenly knew what she was so worried about.


I tried not to smirk but I couldn’t help it. “Well… she’s got black, curly hair and real dark eyes…”


“Oh god! Oh god no!” she began to wail out, throwing her hands up to the sky and calling out to god himself in her lament. “My son’s dating a colored girl! Oh I could die, I could die! Just kill me now, red eyed demon!”


I think it’s pretty par for the course that my family is bigoted to their very rotten core. Look at where we live, look at what they were surrounded by their entire lives. PBS wasn’t even playing Sesame Street at this point and they would’ve had a heart attack if anyone on their black and white TV screen was a shade of gray darker than they were used to anyway. So I hope none of this came as a surprise to anybody reading this. 


I could write up a lengthy defense for my families backward, hateful ways, but fuck ‘em honestly. The only reason they even still had the black & white TV was because they were so fucking afraid of color. I have no defense for them.


“She’s white, ma.” I paused and let the Sister Act calm down and for my mom’s direct long distance line to God hang up and give her back her ten cents.


She dropped her arms and shook her head, angry at me in this instance for scaring her and not at herself for being an irredeemable piece of shit in public. 


“Jewish I think.” I said without even thinking about it. It was just a natural fact to me and everyone else I knew at school, after all.


She threw her arms to the sky and began to wail again, turning and running up the frigid front steps to the front porch and through the screen door crying and screaming about her only son’s betrayal to a “Jew Temptress” whatever the hell that was.


I have to admit, that one kind of caught me off guard. I didn’t know she had that particular flavor of bigot in her. I guess people can always surprise you.


I took the opportunity to unload my suitcase.


I pushed open the screen door with the side of my boot and caught my suitcase between it and the door facing just enough to slide inside. The screen door seemed like a newer one than had been here last year but it was wound far too tight just like every one that had ever been in it’s place before. There was something poetic about that, I thought. A door you could barely open for a home you were barely welcomed in. 


“You made it back, huh?” I looked up to meet my father’s bulldog faced gaze as he pointedly looked me up and down. “They got you sucking communist dicks down there for high grades yet or you still believe in the Constitution?” 


“Well I’m not failing any of my classes.” I said back in my best shitty sarcastic voice. 


He didn’t laugh either. He never laughed at anything except whatever passed as comedy on Gilligan’s Island and when people hurt themselves. The worse, the better. He shook his head and puggishly flopped down into his old disgusting beat up recliner that dominated the living room.


“Go say hi to your mother.” he said flatly.


“I already did, didn’t you see her run into the house screaming like two seconds ago?” I asked with genuine confusion.


“It ain’t my job to keep tabs on women folk. She can throw hysterics to her lady friends, that shit don’t work on me. Men’s too smart.” he said without a hint of a thought about the casual cruelty of saying something like that about his own wife. 


“Right.” I turned to walk back to the staircase beyond the living room.


“You ain’t stayin’ in the upstairs bedroom this year.” my dad’s voice cut through yet again. I leaned out of the hallway back into the living room to see his face, but as always he hadn’t bothered to even look at me. 


“What? Why?” I asked flatly, getting a little tired of lugging my suitcase around at this point.


“Don’t whine at me, college boy. This ain’t Philosophy of Commies 101, you ain’t gettin’ a good grade for limp-wristin’ Lenin’s old gray dick in my house!” he yowled out, slamming a fist down into the old dirty fabric of his chair arm. A spring popped up from underneath what used to pass for suede immediately. “FOR GOD’S SAKES!” he screamed in response, already forgetting me standing there.


I turned and saw my little sister Maggie sitting at the bottom of the steps with a large book sitting on her lap. I walked the distance between us and knelt down to look at the title on the front of the book.


“The South Will Rise Again…?” I asked out loud, looking up at Maggie’s face with raised eyebrows.


“They’re making us read it for school. I gotta do a report on it over Christmas break, it’s like half my grade. It’s mostly about how The Northern War of Aggression split the states but they’re gonna reunite someday.” she said without a hint of irony. I shuddered slightly.


“West Virginia succeeded from Virginia so we could fight with the North though, why are they teaching you this stuff here?” 


“Fuck if I know.” she shrugged.


“MAGGIE WATCH YOUR FUCKING MOUTH!!” Dad screamed from the living room. Maggie and I both shared a soft, silent laugh together. Old habits not to be heard laughing in the house.


“Why am I not staying in my own room this year, anyway?” I finally remembered to ask.


“Uncle Vernon is staying in your room.” she said without looking up from her book.


“What the hell, why?”


“Cause he and Aunt Ruth are having-” she made air quotes with one hand-”Marital problems.” She looked up at me with a rueful grin, the sibling rivalry bubbling up in the back of her malformed little brain. “So Aunt Ruth is staying in the basement and Uncle Vernon is staying in your room. Least until the whiskey dick wears off. Tough luck, Co-Ed. Maybe you oughta write a dissertation to get your room back.”


“Man, not all this again.” I said with a grimace, shifting the handle of my suitcase from one hand to the other. “Why does everyone have to constantly give me shit for going to college? Everyone WANTED me to go my whole life and now that I’m there I’m a bad guy for it?”


She shrugged, looking back at her book. “You’re like… too arrodent now.”


“Arrogant.” I corrected with a sigh.


“See?” she gloated, grinning into her book.


“The North wins at the end.” I spoiled as I walked past her, letting my suitcase bump the book in her hands out of whack as I went. 


At the top of the stairs I peered into my old room, which was exactly how I’d left it last year besides the 56 year old man with chlamydia who was sitting on my bed flipping through my baseball cards with hunger in his eyes. I didn’t remember leaving that in there.


“Hey Uncle Vernon.” I mumbled as I attempted to hurriedly walk past.


“Well if ain’t the BIG TIME COLLEGE BOY himself! Back from learnin’ how to be BETTER THAN US on his father’s dime!” Uncle Vernon called out, swinging his legs over the edge of the bed and shakily standing up to his feet. He stumbled across the room in the way only someone who was really experienced at trying to hide being drunk - but who was infinitely bad at it - could possibly pull off. A kind of uncanny valley of being fucked beyond recognition from sunup to sundown.


“I got a scholarship, Uncle Vernon. Dad didn’t pay anything for my college.” I said a little more clearly.


“Bullshit. You ain’t smart enough to get no money for scholars.” Uncle Vernon stopped at the door and reached a hand out to grab me by my wrist, yanking me close enough for him to put his arm around my neck. His breath absolutely reeked of unidentifiable alcohol. Maybe prison wine, I hadn’t been to the upstairs toilet yet to check. “You ain’t all that, you know that, right? You little fuckin’ peckerhead. You ain’t smarter than ME that’s for sure. I ‘bout trapped me a monster last month, even! Bet YOU ain’t even seen it!”


“So why aren’t you and Aunt Ruth sharing a room this year?” I interrupted his ghost hunter horse shit, yanking myself free of his disgusting grasp as quickly as I could. Not that he could maintain an erection at this point let alone a sleeper hold on a full grown man. Only one of his hadn’t been bathing in gin every night since high school prom, after all. 


“She uh…” he stumbled, both figuratively and literally, almost falling back through the open door. “Hey FUCK YOU, Brainiac! Get the fuck outta my sight!” He turned away violently and stumbled back over to my bed, flopping down on it and causing like a big wave of Pig Pen dirt cloud to raise into the air around him. 


“I hope whoever she marries after you smells a little better.” I called after him, turning and walking further down the hallway.


My mother was standing in the bathroom, waiting at the end of the hall. I knew it before I’d even taken a step in that direction. And I knew exactly what she’d be doing as well. 


I stepped past the open door and she immediately began to wipe at her eyes, as if on cue, and fake blubbering into the bathroom towels.


“Oh my son is wayward, Jesus! He’s lost his way from your light!” she spoke muffled into the towel over her face.


“Ma, Jewish people also believe in Jesus.” I pleaded, trying my best to leave out the fact that they believed he was a pretty great guy, but not the son of god. I didn’t want her to go into conniptions within the first five minutes of my visit. That’s like a day 2 thing, usually. 


She grabbed the door and slammed it closed in my face, fake scream-crying at the top of her lungs inside. 


I stood silently for a moment, debating on getting back in my car and driving to a motel or something. Maybe off the side of the nearest cliff I could find. At least until I remembered I didn’t have enough cash on me to rent a pillow let alone a room. And even worse, what if I survived the drop off the cliff?


Suddenly the door swung back open violently, “You’re staying in the attic! Get outta my sight so I can think about how to save your soul! No dinner until your soul is saved!”


And then the door was slammed shut again. I shrugged.


The pull-down stairs to the attic worked ok. I slid my suitcase up ahead of me just in case anyway. It had been a long time, pretty obviously, since someone had cleaned up there. Cobwebs had pretty much taken the place over the the peripheries and there were stacks and stacks of old boxes, and busted old furniture laying everywhere against every wall. 


I stood in the middle of the room and tried my hardest to figure out where the bed was up there. Everything was piled so high and deep that it seemed like maybe curling up on the floor was gonna be it. 


But eventually I noticed a bit of bedspread poking out from underneath some old boxes labeled “Tax Filing, 1958.” in faded old marker across the side. Right next to a box labeled “Cool Stuff, Do Not Open” that was filled to the brim with Tijuana Bibles and nudie illustrations. I’d check back on that one a little later. It took me the better part of an hour to clear off the bed, dust off its surface, and make certain there wasn’t anything in the sheets, covers, or pillows that was gonna bite me in my dreams.


The entire time I couldn’t help but notice, behind an old dresser and a mirror vanity covered over with doilies and lace, was a door. It was a fairly plain old door, with a dim copper handle inset into a steel plate like they used to make back before the war. The house was fairly old, so that wasn’t really the strange part about it.


I spent a good amount of time trying to figure out the layout of the house and what could possibly be behind that door. To start with I figured it had to be a closet, and that didn’t have to be too big, so it was probably that. But then I noticed, on the same wall, not fifteen feet away, was a window with light streaming in from its muddy, hazy old glass. That had to be a door to absolutely nothing, right? Just a straight drop outside. 


But for the life of me, I’d never seen the other side of this door from the outside. It was just brick out there. 


I had cleaned the bed off and laid down and was still trying to figure out what the point of that door was. And how exactly it had been constructed so that it looked, at least from where I was laying, to be completely flush with the brick wall of the outside of the house but was also covered by brick on the outside? It was at least taking my mind off of my shithole family for a moment.


I didn’t even bother to get undressed or go back down for the dinner I’d been forbidden to join. Eventually I just fell asleep.


That night I dreamed of the moon hanging so low in the sky as to swallow it whole, tinged as crimson bloody as any I’d ever seen in my lifetime. The sky was blackness everywhere I looked beyond it.  It’s kind’ve hard to explain. It overwhelmed every sense and even then somehow I could feel its burning hot gaze centered directly on me. The sweat I woke up covered in was cold, nonetheless.


I’d phoned ahead to let my old buddy Darren Shansky know I was coming in to visit and he was gonna get a group together to have lunch down at the Silverline Diner in town, so I was actually looking forward to something at home for the first time in a long while.


But that morning I received another phone call from Darren, letting me know none of them were gonna make it.


“What do you mean? The whole gang was supposed to be meeting for a big time catch-up!” I asked, genuinely pretty shocked.


There was silence for a moment on the other line. 


“Look uh… Indie… I’m sorry man, but the old gang wasn’t too turned on by the idea of seeing ya.” Darren said with a touch of solemnity in his voice.


“Well I wasn’t planning on fuckin’ em or anything. What’s the problem?” I queried. 


He didn’t laugh. I was noticing a pattern.


“You’ve uh…” Darren started.


“You abandoned them, Indie! Of COURSE they’re not gonna wanna see you!” A female voice chimed in from just beyond the phone, as if she’d been listening in the entire time. The voice of my high school sweetheart, Emily Burbank. “You went off to some commie pinko draft-dodger factory and you expect everyone in town to bend over backwards to suck the red off of your dick? You oughta be ashamed of yourself!”


“What the fuck?” I started, leaning back from the phone in shock. “I just wanted to get a good job and now I’m a fucking commie draft dodger?! I haven’t even been drafted!”


“Now look here, Indie, you ain’t got the right to raise your voice to my wife like that!” Darren interrupted, anger rising in his voice. 


“Wife?!” I called out confused. “When the hell did you two get married all the sudden?”


“You weren’t invited to the ceremony. Americans only.” Emily said with a sneer.


“Americans aren’t allowed to go to college?!” I asked, exasperation tainting my expression a bit.


“You coulda gone to school here, but nah, you had to toot on off to Atlanta. You even sound like one of those big city boys with your dumbass accent now.” Darren snapped back, his voice shaking.


“I can’t help the way I talk, god damnit!” I yelled back.


“Emily told me how you broke her heart goin’ off to school and now everyone here knows you’re shacked up with some god damn Jew up there too? How fuckin’ dare you think you can just come crawlin’ back into town after all that shit.” Darren growled out.


“You sound like you wanna throw hands, Darren.” I snarled my best, most intimidating snarl, “I know exactly how many times those hands have been up your own ass. Diddling the shit outta your jizzing gland, digging for white gold in your colon.” 


“I TOLD YOU THAT IN CONFIDENCE!!” The line went dead. I hung up the phone gingerly.


“Did you tell everyone in god damn town about my girlfriend, Ma?” I asked with that frustration teeming over the edge of every word, knowing she would be eavesdropping just beyond the room.


“Of course I did!” she snapped back, turning from the sink with wet soapy hands holding a plate that was dripping on the floor like mini-waterfalls to look into the hallway where I stood. “The only way to stop someone from making the biggest mistakes of their life is to bring all their friends in on it! We need to all be here to help you see that slut temptress is dragging you from the light of god! Shame is my game, that’s what Jesus said!”


“You gotta be FUCKING KIDDING ME!” I screamed out, throwing my own hands in the air. She took a step back as if I was going to kill her or something, even though I never raise my voice around my parents as a rule.


“Oh my god, he’s attacking his poor mother now. Must be the Jew magic spell on him.” Aunt Ruth stood at the end of the hallway into the kitchen, literally clutching her pearls and making the sign of the cross over her chest. I wanted to tell her how fucking stupid she was being doing a Catholic rite as a Baptist, but I just shook my head, and went on upstairs.


Back to my hole. Back to the attic. Hopefully they would bring me some fresh fish heads to eat on the morrow cause I still hadn’t eaten a damn thing since I’d gotten here. 


I managed to find a twinkie in my suitcase that I’d packed for the road and scarf it down while sitting on the edge of my bed. In the distance below me I could hear my mother’s muffled voice frantically explaining how I’d picked up a chair and threatened to suplex her like King Kong Bundy if she didn’t stop loving God or something. I sighed.


“London bridge is falling down… falling down… falling down…”


I jolted to the sudden sound of soft voices just beyond my hearing. I looked around in the dimly lit attic for where it was coming from, but I couldn’t see it.


I moved from one end of the room to the other as best I could considering all the detritus filling up the attic to its brim, but the sound didn’t ever seem to come into focus. 


Suddenly a cold realization worked its way up my spine. I knew exactly where the sound of voices was coming from. I tried to rationalize, tried to work out in my mind exactly how I was probably just stressed and it couldn’t possibly be true. But it was true.


The door. 


I felt something in my gut I’d only felt one time before in my life. Just a couple short years ago, when I loaded up my Pinto with what little meager belongings I owned and drove away from this house, seeing the figures of my family slowly regressing in the rearview mirror until they were all suddenly gone, for the first time in my life. The sudden, unmistakable sense of escape. I’d never felt it before that moment, awash over me and floating behind my eyeballs.


And now, somehow, I felt that same bubbling excitement at the edge of my reach, staring wide-eyed and slackjawed at the old wooden door, half-hidden behind the old dresser and the linen-covered vanity mirror across the room.


I frantically began to dig through the refuse that blocked me off from that door. I heaved old furniture out of the way, kicked boxes across the room, splayed papers out over the floor, heaved old chests out of the way, literally anything that stood in my way was cleared. 


It felt like it took only a few minutes but by the time I stood face to face in front of that old rickety door, three hours had passed in my toil. I didn’t even feel the fatigue that had settled into my muscles, only the white hot burning glory of escape - of freedom away from all of this. 


My hand shook as I reached for the old copper handle, and in that moment I couldn’t really explain to you why. I didn’t feel the gnawing fear just beyond the euphoric drive in my bones. I didn’t feel anything except the overwhelming desire to open that door. So why was I shaking so violently?


“London bridge is falling down…. Falling down… falling down…”


The voices far beyond the old door repeated their whispering melody, tinny and fine, like a brand new record first played, spurring me on. I twisted my wrist, the old copper mechanism within the door springing to life as if it had been opened every day and not lain dormant for fifty years. 


The old wooden door creaked on it’s hinges, and the song became louder and louder the wider I pulled the door, straining my eyes to see around it’s shape into the darkness beyond. 


“London bridge is falling down… falling down…”


“INDIE!!!” the shrieking voice of my father belted out from downstairs broke me from my reverie. 


I stared into the now-wide-open door. I trembled at the sight, shaking so hard that the door handled rattled in my hand. Fear gripped me, confusion washed over me like an ocean’s wake.


On the other side of that door, was an exact replica, down to the exact placement of the exact same knick-knacks, bricka-brack, and old furniture I had tossed around all willy-nilly moments before - in the EXACT same places I’d left them. 


A cold wind drew me back away from it, my fingers slipping from the door handle as I stumbled away, fear gripping me tighter than it had ever gripped me in my life, overwhelming all need for escape in my heart.


“INDIE!! GET THE FUCK DOWN HERE! The Reverend is coming over to do a new baptism on you and this one BETTER FUCKING TAKE!!” Dad screamed up the stairs at me.


Fuck it. I rushed through the door.


It felt like escape at the time. 


The instant my last step crossed that threshold, into that other attic, there was no door any longer. I was left hazy, light headed, standing in the same attic, but there was the heavy feeling of being watched in everything I did. 


It’s hard to explain it now, but I didn’t even feel the need to double check if the door was gone. I knew it was, already. I knew nothing much in that new attic, but I knew that. And I was pressed on by something… curiosity, maybe? You watch these films where someone blunders into danger without a care in the world and you feel they’re foolish beyond what anyone could really be. I remember thinking that as I let down the stairs from the attic to go down into the house below.


Everything there was muted. Not just in color, but in the musty smell and taste in the air, the feeling of touching the bannister railing of the stairs. The sound of the whispering singing even sounded further and further away. There was a hint of something beyond all of this, something huge. Something beyond what I could comprehend. It’s all kind’ve hard to explain.


By the time I stepped out the front door onto what should have been the street I finally understood the largeness of this feeling welling within my chest. There was no street, just an endless black void which stretched as far as the eye could see in every conceivable direction.


Even down. It seemed one wrong step and I would have plummeted forever into that widening abyss, it’s hungry toothless maw awaiting me just as I recoiled from it. 


But above… there was something still. Blood red and motionless, unlidded and un-pointed but ever-watching. The moon hung there in the sky, full and round and near to bursting with the crimson it’s surface radiated and undulated from. The blood moon.


I tried to step away from it, but there was nowhere to step. The house was gone. All that was was me, the barely audible sound of distant singing, and the nothing that closed in around me.


The blood moon shuddered in the sky. I tried to scream. I swear to you I tried to scream. It may sound as if I marched happily to my fate, but I will do anything for you to understand that I tried to scream. But I couldn’t. 


The moon rolled across the empty sky like a scarlet marble dropped from a hand onto an unseen table. And slowly following its course, as if it was the rising dawn itself, was a second crimson moon which arose from beyond the blackness far beyond what I saw and sailed across the ocean of night to take its place perfectly aligned alongside its predecessor. As if ordained by some cosmic understanding that that’s where it belonged.


I suddenly knew, in a sort of cold blast of understanding, that I wasn’t looking at two moons any longer, each blood red and dangling from the nothing above me. I was staring and being stared at by two unknowable massive red eyes which looked upon me like the gaze of the angry god I had been warned about my entire life. The blood froze in my veins and the beating of my heart became loud enough to rupture my ear drums as I met the piercing violent gaze in the sky which peeled me away layer by layer as it drilled into my very soul.


My body jerked through the air, and I suddenly felt the rush of wind about me. I traveled further than anyone had ever traveled before in that one moment, in that endless hellscape, up and up, as those red, hateful eyes grow closer and closer, and closer. 


Until there was no difference between them and my own eyes. 


I had hand-waved it off as local superstition gone haywire. I wish I had taken it more seriously.


From behind its eyes I saw the thing that took my body kill each and every member of my family in that old brick house in the middle of town. There was no joy in it for the thing, it simply had to cover its escape. This wasn’t what was meant to happen to it, but it understood somehow, and I did as well, somehow, that this was the next phase of its existence, like many before it had experienced.


It needed a better way to warn people.


There were two times since then I could parse beyond the eyes and feel, and see, and live for even a moment as myself again. Perhaps it was my force of will that allowed the breakthrough but there’s also maybe the chance that the thing in my body took pity upon me and allowed it.


The first time I wrote a letter to Nancy. I told her I loved her but I had a terminal disease. I wished her well and hoped for her a long and happy life. I wished that she would remember me for the rest of it, and maybe to talk about me from time to time. Just so the memory of me would not die as I had to.


The last time I wrote this journal entry. I just want people to understand that I lived. That I wasn’t always this… this thing.


I was a human being once.


    Indrid Cold, December 1967
