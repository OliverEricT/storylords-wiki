Die in the Dream, Die in Real Life

Prompts: Countdowns & Dreams

By Jeff Pennington

David stood at the edge of a grand gothic balcony, carved meticulously out of black stone which shimmered like stars in the cold night’s air, his eyes squinting against the gigantic pale moon which dominated the sky in front of him. As far as the eye could see in the distance the slow swaying of ocean waves brought the sea closer, then further away, rhythmically, steadily. The salt water smell permeated his senses and the bracing wind whipped across his face like a balm to his mind. He had come here a thousand times before, and would return a thousand times more – his retreat, his escape from everything that haunted him. It felt like an eternity could pass in this reprieve and nothing could spoil it.

He glanced down at the water once more but when he returned his eyes to the massive moon above, no longer was it pale and placid as before, instead it was a deep flaming red.  All along its surface pulsed horrendous veins pumping foul blood just beneath. He turned to run but his legs would not move, as if rooted to the ground beneath him, and no matter how he pulled and pushed no escape came to him. He tried to scream, but no sound escaped his lips, for the sound of a clock ticking overcame all other sound in his world. Before his eyes in the hazen distance of his once peaceful retreat he saw the blood red specter of numbers counting down. 500… 499….498…

His body twisted and convulsed against his control and from within his throat came an inhuman and virulent tone he had never heard before in all of his days. A hissing scream that curdled his blood and bit into his very thoughts like a serrated knife. He moved with an alarming speed in an animal-like gait into that darkness, which swirled and eddied around him like a viscous ashen smoke, coating his lungs and burning his eyes, but his body was no longer his and whoever controlled it did not care one way or another about the pain.

Finally, sitting before him on a small marble column in the darkness… was an Epson G11 Inkjet Printer, wreathed in red moonlight. The rage that overcame him was white-hot and uncontrollable, it pressed him on like a bullet propelled from a chamber and he was upon it ripping out its insides and throwing them freely behind him like confetti. His hands were not his own, they were that of a diseased beast, covered in blood-matted fur and festering sores. The printer was shredded to nothingness and again he tried to scream but

“WAKEY WAKEY SLEEPYHEAD!!”

David Brewster’s head shot up off his desk instantly, a slack-jawed, half-asleep questioning groan escaping him as he did. The bright lights of the office nearly blinded him but he had awakened like this a million times from an impromptu nap at his desk before, so he was well-practiced at adjusting by this point.

“Oooo looks like Dumpy’s got a case of the MONDAYS!” said Carol, the head of HR, who was standing just outside David’s cubicle holding a slice of cake on a Little Dixie paper plate in one hand and a teeny tiny spork in the other. “Poor Dumpy!”

“My name is David…!” David managed to growl out, wiping the sleep from his eyes with the back of his fist. “It’s literally your job to remember that!”

You see, David had gotten his nickname on his first day of working at GriftCo, a subsidiary of The Blatant Fraud Corporation. Why Dumpy, you ask? Why it’s because of his gigantic bouncing double bubble of a juicy ol’ janglin’ fat DUMP TRUCK of an ass, of course. I mean this dude was packing so much back meat that you could open up a Bar-b-que joint in the back pocket of his wranglers and still have buns left over for the rest of the franchise - this dude was slangin’ CHEEKS every god damn day of the WEEKS. I mean god DAMN, folks.

“Oh Dumpy, don’t be so square! Not when that thang of yours is so ROUND!” Carol tittered at her own joke, turning on her heels and twinkletoe-ing away down the row of cubicles like a 60’s cartoon character with the jangly bell sounds and everything.

“You’re LITERALLY head of HR! You can’t say that shit to me!” Dumpy… I mean David yelled after her, but absolutely no one heard or cared.

“You get that Jameson Report finished and submitted yet, Dumpy?” a voice from behind him came, and David spun around to see who was going to bother him now - which was no easy task cause that thang’s like a fuckin WRECKING BALL back there y’all, I SAID GOD DAMN but still  he turned to see his direct middle manager boss. Bob Tully standing behind him with a stern look on his old sunken stupid bulldog face. (writer’s note: fuck this guy before I even properly write anything about him)

“Uh, not yet sir… I’ll have it to you by lunch though. I’ve just been uh.. Under the weather lately.” David replied with a small tug on his collar in that universal way that said “OOOO BOOIII” or maybe something like “uuuhhh oohhhhh”. You know the one. “I think a guy on the bus nicked me with a drug syringe or something, I’ve just been-”

“Whatever Dumpy, no one needs to hear your entire life story. Waddle your huge swaying asscheeks on down to maintenance and see if they can fix the printer on floor 3 while you’re sucking up a paycheck to pay to let the back seat of every pair of pants you buy out by 20 feet.” Mr. Tully said, turning and walking away. He dabbed away sweat from his forehead and muttered under his breath as he went, “It’s always clapping by itself too, jesus…”

Dumpy stood there…. David stood there, y’know what actually, fuck it, there’s no other name for a dude with a backyard like this, his name is Dumpy. Dumpy stood there motionless, somehow feeling like he had not only lost a lot of self-respect in that exchange, but had also somehow lost some respect cosmically - like his own life story had given up giving him the dignity of using his own name. Sorry buddy.

“That’s not even my job…” he muttered to himself.

After a few minutes to suck it up and tell himself for the 400th time this week that this was only a temporary job and that temporary can mean for the 10 years he’d already worked here as long as he believed in it hard enough - he finally turned and headed down the hallway toward maintenance.

He knocked twice on the door marked ‘Maintenance Office’ and stood silently in the dimly lit hallway. Ironically the light just outside the maintenance office was flickering and busted which gave the dead-end hall a real slasher movie feeling that didn’t make Dumpy feel any better about the weird ass dream he’d had a few minutes before. He would consult his dream diaries Reddit community thread about THIS one when he got home, you can bet your ass on that!

It suddenly became glaringly obvious that he had been standing in his empty hallway in front of this door thinking to himself exactly how he was going to word his angry post about how all of their guided dream shit fell apart whenever Carol from HR chewed her office party birthday cake cud next to his ear for about five straight minutes now.

He went to knock again finally but he pressed against the door for a moment by accident, causing it to slowly open inward, the hinges creaking like an abandoned hundred year old home. This maintenance team fucking SUCKED, jesus.

Dumpy pushed the door open and peered into the room past the edge of the door. The only light in the entire room was from a lamp on a desk in the corner, but it was fairly easy to see that the front office of the maintenance department was completely unmanned. Dumpy shook his head, silently judging these people for a lot of shit at this point, when out of the corner of his eye, behind the desks in the middle of the room, he saw it.

It was shredded to absolute bits, ripped piece from piece, and dumped together haphazardly in the middle of the uncarpeted floor, but it was inarguable what he was staring at with recognition and horror. An Epson G11 Inkjet Printer. And it had been torn to absolute pieces in the exact same way as he had left it in his dream. He shuddered and backed away from the door, his entire body wracked with fear.

Then he stopped himself. “Why the hell am I afraid of a broken up printer…? So what if I dreamed it getting broken? Maybe I heard about it in my sleep from Carol or Todd Bungus in the next cubicle over. This is so stupid.”

Dumpy walked into the maintenance office and stepped around the desks, headed over to the shredded old printer, and knelt down next to it. Unfortunately, his incalculably massive buttcheeks touched down like two meteors crashing into the planet Earth and extincting the Dinosaurs to death when he knelt down too fast, so he was instantly seated on it. Don’t worry though, he was still technically over top of the printer though, his seat cushions were so dynamically immense that he would have a birds-eye view of the whole town sitting down if you catch my drift. That shit’s BIG, BOY.

He rummaged through the pieces for a moment or two, feeling the familiarity of it, before a strange sensation overcame him. His vision blurred slightly and his entire body slowly slumped over, an intense drowsiness -unlike any kind of exhaustion he’d ever felt - crept over him fast and strong, until all he could do was lay full down on the cold, hard concrete floor. And the moment his head touched down, he was out.

The blood red numbers in his dreams continued to slip through the darkness one after another. 327….326….325…

“AGH!” Dumpy screamed, shooting up off the floor onto his hands and knees and then back up onto his unsteady feet, wobbling back and forth because of all that back-ballast he was carrying, and finally finding his center of gravity. “Wh… wha…? Why did…?” he muttered, looking around the room with wide, terrified eyes.

But he stopped questioning when he saw the parts strewn about him. The printer had been split into pieces well before but now it littered the room around him in even more jagged, mishapen chunks, but it wasn’t alone. A hand dangled from it’s wrist’s tendons from the side of the desk near the front, a leg was strewn across the workbench in the back, a gaping mouthed head sat neatly tucked into the center of the printer’s chassis, staring wide-eyed and sightless back up at him. The entire room was covered in splatters and pools of blood, which trickled and dripped sickeningly across every mundane item that once made this place seem so normal before.

He stumbled backward, his voice trembling, trying to form words, but none could escape the lump in his throat. He looked down at his own body and saw… nothing. Not a single speck of blood on him. Like he had been covered with a tarp when the slaughter had occurred, like he had been gently placed into the aftermath of a double homicide.

The scream finally left his throat and he ran full tilt out the doorway and back down the hall toward the cubicle farm he had slaved away in for a decade. The people he passed barely even registered him, as always, even as he screamed and leapt through the office like a madman. They just didn’t seem to care.

He finally made it to the door to HR and banged on it over and over. It took a full minute of banging before the door was wrenched open and Carol stared at him with a hateful glare in her eyes, her mouth screwed-up into a grimace. “WHAT?! I’m on my god damn BREAK, Dumpy!!”

“There’s been a…!! There’s been a… a murder! Two murders! We… we gotta get security! The-the… two killed..!” Dumpy blurted out, tripping over his words, being absolutely frantic at this point.

“Oh piss off you little fuckin crybaby, just do what Mr. Tully asked you to do and stop parading your junky trunk around here thinking you’re better than the rest of us flat-asses! I’ve had it up to here with you whining about your nickname and submitting HR reports on everyone for using your ass-crack as a goal for paper football! It’s just a bit of fun!” Carol ranted ruefully at him, turning her completely board-flat droopy pancake ass around and slamming the door to her office behind her.

“Wh…What?” Dumpy sputtered out, taken out of the horror of his situation completely by that entire interaction. He shook it out of his head and turned to run away but even frantic as he was had to stop running after one step and turn back to look at Carol’s door with complete bewilderment on his face, let out one last “HUH?”, and then run off full tilt back across the cubicle farm.

He made it to Mr. Tully’s office and beat on his door as well, the visions of blood red numbers running down in his head now appearing to him in the distance in his waking moment as well. He tried as hard as he could to ignore them as he grabbed the door handle and yanked it open without waiting for an answer.

Mr. Tully was pretty shocked to see Dumpy come into his office without him being invited in alright, but nowhere near as shocked as the woman who WASN’T Mrs. Tully was, since she was right in the middle of taking some serious dictation from the boss when he arrived. If you don’t catch my meaning what I’m saying is that Mr. Tully was fucking some broad over his desk when Dumpy Kramered in on them and now she’s embarrassed cause she’s got an old gross fuckwit’s ding dong up her hoo-hah. You get it now.

She screamed in terror and surprise. Mr. Tully screamed in rage and surprise. Dumpy screamed as well, but for his part because he felt his entire body go limp once more - and not just because the sight of Mr. Tully’s old skrinkly bulldog-faced dick had made it impossible for Dumpy to ever be erect again - though it had - but because the exhaustion and drowsiness had overtaken him once more. He fell face-first onto the floor in a heap, everything going black for him in an instant.

98….97….96…

He gasped in air hard once more, his body jerking up from its position and his bleary-eyed stare catching sight for just one second of a gigantic dark form leering over him. He tried to scream out, but the form was gone in an instant, flashing toward him like a video error before being as if it had never been there to begin with.

He struggled to his feet, his hands slipping and sliding in the blood that coated the linoleum beneath him. His stomach flipped and turned in on itself, his breath heaving out of his chest as he raised up to his feet one more time, already completely sure what he would find when he looked around the room.

Blood, guts, human body parts, machinery, all strewn around the room like a bomb had gone off. Gigantic sweeping marks pock-marked every wall and surface that was even slightly still in tact, and the massive bay window of the office was completely smashed out, half of a torso hanging out of it, dangling by its own entrails in the cold winter’s wind that swept into the office.

The sight was so incredibly gruesome that in any other story our protagonist would assuredly get violently sick right there but I’m writing this one so he doesn’t cause that’s icky. Yes, I know the rest of this story is also very icky but there’s nothing spooky about vomit, so fuck you.

There was no way in hell, no way in any shape or form, that the residents of the office didn’t hear this bloodbath being done. He was certain now that something was stalking him, murdering everyone he was in contact with, horrifically, and inhumanly, and it must be so loud and visceral that everyone in the building must be screaming and running for their lives by now.

He threw open Mr. Tully’s office door and… well I mean it’s not shocking to us the audience, but it was to him, everyone was still just in their cubicles working on their Windows 98 machines. All except for Cowboy Bob who was standing near the elevator at the front of the office, putting his ten gallon hat on and saying his goodbyes to the secretary.

“Beggin’ yer pardon ma’am but I’mma be hitting that ol’ dusty trail a little early today. My son went campin with his football team buddies over the weekend and never checked back in with his mama n’ me, so we’re gonna go aheadn’ check up on ‘im. Mighty obliged.” Cowboy Bob said, tipping his stetson to Belinda the secretary and stepping into the elevator, his spurs clinking as the doors closed.

Dumpy raced across the room screaming, every head in the place turning towards him in confusion, but mild interest at best, like when a bird has flown into the office by accident or two people wear the same tie without realizing. He leapt into his chair at his desk, compressing the FUCK out of that air glide because of his aforementioned max-level glutes. Before we get to the end of the story, I just wanted to remind you that this dude was sporting an absolutely bonkers rump - the kind of hindquarters that trophy hunters mount on their wall and porn stars mount in their dreams. The kind of hefty hangin’ haunches that could feed a family of bears for this winter and every one to come. I’m talkin’ REAL globes where life could flourish freely in verdant fields and there’s no war back there cause there’s room for EVERYONE.

But I digress.

Dumpy heaved breaths as he grabbed at the landline phone on his desk, the blood coating his hands making it slip out of his grasp and onto the desk with a loud plastic clanking before he fumbled it back up to his ear. His hands were shaking so hard that he could barely type 9… 1…

The phone fell to the floor with a resounding thud, it’s cord jangling back and forth from the impact freely. Dumpy’s face slammed into his desk and remained there, motionless.

The other denizens of the office finally gathered around, looking over him with confusion and disgust at his bloodied state. They began to whisper amongst each other about him maybe having a bad nosebleed, cause Tippy Santiago in Accounting saw him picking his nose by the watercooler once. Bingo Jones in Corporate Accounts Receivable, who was a genuine piece of shit liar who loved to just spew horse shit to get attention, swore up and down that he was a coke addict and that he and Dingy Ben from the Warehouse had seen him using cocaine behind the dumpsters with a stinky old hooker on lunch hour many a time. Everyone believed him because it was an office and believing this shit was better than the lives they had to live here any day.

They were all silenced pretty instantly when Dumpy’s body began to convulse on his desk though. It shook violently for a moment and then stopped, the bare skin of his face and arms plodding against the metal of his desk sickeningly. There was a moment of held breath where the office denizens took a step back from him then, all eyes staring unblinking on him.

3….2…..1…..

That made it impossible to miss the sight of something pushing against his back, from the inside. Pressing it outward and then letting it sink back in. They began to panic then, and then screams rang out as visible hand prints from inside his body began to distend the skin outward, violently pushing against the cage of his flesh from within. The office workers were scattering and screaming when his back split open down the spinal cord and flayed outward like a reversed autopsy to reveal a growing, gigantic, black furred form within that lurched out onto the ground like an animal’s birth.

The form continued to swell, and the cracking and forming of bones filled the room almost at the same moment as the swelling sound of a beastial, guttural snarl. Fingers as long as arms unfurled and gripped into the floor, the lights overhead flashing and strobing violently just from this things presence making it impossible to make out exactly what it was outside of it’s wrinkled elongated maw lined with jagged, overlapping, dripping teeth and it’s immense body covered every inch in black ashen fur.

It stood up to its full height, reaching from floor to ceiling with size to spare, its gigantic leg smashing down into the floor beneath it. It reared its head back and opened its jaw beyond its widest point, the cheeks splitting to accommodate row after row of slathering teeth within. And from the depths of this creature’s form came a screeching, inhuman scream that sent blood erupting from the ears of every human being who fled for their lives within the office that day.

—-------

The phone rang only once. An electronically deepened and disguised voice answered without hesitation, “Report.”

The man holding the bloody office landline phone to his ear placed a small handkerchief over its receiver and spoke quickly in turn, “The experiment was beyond success. The next generation Chrysalid far exceeds anything that’s come before. Turnaround time is now down to 8 minutes once the serum matures. Zero degradation.”

“We will move forward with continued production then.” the electronic voice on the other line responded.

“Hail Gestalt.” they both said in unison, the phone lines going dead.

THE END
