The Title of This One 

Prompts: Incantations & Cooking

By Jeff Pennington


PREVIOUSLY, ON SPOOKYVISION…


“Now what brings ya heah on this fine evenin’, Dev my boy? You lookin’ for a nice cup of coffee? Or a rat?” Uncle Otis said.


WE NOW CONTINUE WITH SPOOKYVISION…


Jason Grace had spent the better part of half a season of this godforsaken show with his head up his ass, searching high and low, at least over the distance of about 25 miles between the two towns I’ve bothered to create, for the whereabouts of his younger brother, Archie.


Now those in the know will have found this entire plotline kind of sadistic to put a dude through since Archie got vivisected to fuck and back by a big ol’ bug man near the beginning of the season, but it’s leading somewhere, I promise you, just fuckin’ DEAL WITH IT for a little while longer, jesus. 


But even given all of that, here Jason stood, face to face with his lost younger brother. Archie looked exactly as he remembered him, with a bright smile on his face and his hands outstretched to him for a welcoming hug - just like every time Jason had come back from college. But instead of being at home where their parents got increasingly angry at Jason telling his younger brother stories about boofing and threesomes in toilet stalls they were now standing in a big empty warehouse behind a taxidermy slash coffee shop. It would make sense if you listened to the last episode (writer’s note: it wouldn’t.)


But they weren’t alone here, Jason had arrived with a new friend(?) named Dev Durwood the Third, some kind of a fucked up Potara Earing fusion of Urkel and your uncle who swears on his life he once kissed Bigfoot– SAW BIGFOOT. SAW HIM. AND THAT’S ALL.


For his part Dev just stared on in utter confusion, not knowing who the fuck these white people even were to begin with so having no context for why Jason had suddenly become so emotional.


“Archie, I finally found you, man! Where have you been?!” Jason knelt down to Archie’s height and wrapped his arms around his younger brother, pressing him in tightly to his chest. Tears began to well in Jason’s eyes, the heavy certainty that he was on a wild goose chase and would never see his brother again evaporating from his mind and lightening his heart. 


“I got lost, Jason… I was so scared…” Archie said in a hoarse, floaty whisper, his own arms wrapping tightly around his brother’s torso underneath the blue jean jacket he always wore.


Dev watched on, piecing together that they must be related or something by this point but not much else, feeling a strange unease begin to well up in his chest. He looked around the room warily, feeling like he was being observed from afar all of the sudden. But he didn’t see anything in the barely lit darkness that hovered at distance from them.


But when he turned his eyes back to Jason and the young boy he was holding, there was the faintest flicker of silver in the air above them. It caught Dev’s eye almost immediately and sent his heart to pounding inside of his chest like a violent beating at the door. He had seen this flash of metallic light in the air only once before in his life.


“Oh cheezum, Jason! JASON!” Dev began to yell out, but Jason didn’t even move. The lights began to flicker around them and suddenly Dev felt a million miles away from his new companion, his voice barely catching on the wind at all any longer, remaining trapped within his throat.


The darkness that was once torn open by dim white light here and there throughout the massive room was now horribly obliterated by brilliant scarlet light which bathed the entire scene like a Giallo thriller from wall to wall.


“You left me to die, Jason… “ Archie hoarsely whispered out into Jason’s ear, his voice hissing and popping painfully against his ear-drum. 


Jason yanked his head back away from his younger brother in shock, his eyes widening instantly at what he was now holding in his arms. It was still Archie, the incredibly horrific pain in his chest told him that, but his body was broken, ripped open, bleeding all over Jason’s clothing. Archie’s face was mostly gone, leaving only a single untouched eye and half his mouth worth of flesh on his head, but even that wasn’t enough - a long, disgusting, sluciing slice of some unseen blade drug itself across Archie’s throat, severing his head from his shoulders entirely - and dropping it directly into the scrambling Jason’s lap as he tried to get away.


Jason screamed, finally, his voice leaving his throat after what felt like an eternity. But the sound of his scream was completely overshadowed by the high pitched, ear-splitting B-Horror Movie scream queen screech that had finally escaped Dev’s throat a few feet behind him. 


“P-please, Archie…!” Jason screamed out at the top of his lungs as he tried to wrench his body away from the vice-like grip of the corpse of his own brother, but he could not budge, not even an inch away. 


The face in his lap sneered a lipless, hateful sneer, the distorted, scratchy voice of Archie escaping it’s hollow, endless maw as it mocked his own words back at him, “PLEASE ARCHIE! PLEASE ARCHIE! PLEASE ARCHIE!”


The severed head began to cackle wildly, the bright red light that engulfed the entire warehouse suddenly dying out, leaving the encroaching darkness around them once more. But each dull halogen in their swaying metal lamps above them still burned a keen red which only served to make the darkness around them more deeply black. 


From within that darkness, lengths of metallic string came falling down around Jason as if being unspooled from far above, surrounding him in a perfect circle. The small hands of his brother held him tightly in place as each of those metal wires began to snap taut around his body, digging into his flesh and causing him to scream bloody murder from the pain. 


“I–I tried to…! I tried to save you..!” Jason screamed louder and louder as each wire tore deeper into him until all of them were wrapped around him like a jagged metal cocoon. Then each wire began to draw back into the darkness, lifting both Jason and the corpse of his own brother, up into the inky blackness beyond the light - which engulfed them, devoured them, and left no sight of them in turn. 


Dev had not stopped screaming bloody murder at a pitch mostly only dogs could hear this entire time.


Just as suddenly as the lights had come and gone before the entire room was lit to within blinding levels by scorching hot crimson light which threatened to blind Dev where he lay on the ground screaming. Dev placed both hands over his eyes, but peered through the blinding brightness just the same between his fingers.


Above him, high above where the top of the warehouse should have still been, was a blood red moon hanging low in the night’s sky. And just in front of it, silhouetted against its seering brightness, was the unmistakable shape of woman’s body - held aloft by two sets of immense wide-spread moth wings which threatened to blot out the light behind them by their sheer enormity. 


Dev, not being quite as white as some of the other protagonists of these stories, immediately jumped up to his feet and began to run away as fast as humanly fucking possible.


As he ducked around several corners of shelves full of like beavers and shit that had been taxidermied, he couldn’t help but note that the blinding red light had subsided once again - replaced all over again by the barely lit darkness of the old warehouse. Not that that stopped him from running, he couldn’t even begin to fathom when he’d EVER stop at this point, honestly.


He caught sight in the distance of a set of double doors and didn’t slow down for anything. Even as he ran he could hear and feel the massive beating wings of something insurmountably large just behind him, just always out of reach of him. It all made him pump his spindly little nerd arms and legs harder than he had ever done before. 


BAM!!


He burst through the doors and leapt onto the floor behind a bunch of stacked boxes, rolling into a Sonic the Hedgehog ass dweeb ball as he tucked behind them for cover. 


The double doors swung shut with a heavy clasping thud behind him and he sat quietly, his chest heaving and every muscle in his body burning. The room was fairly lit within compared to the rest of the warehouse, so he finally kind’ve knew where he was. 


The stacked boxes everywhere told him this must’ve been a shipping department. He wasn’t really aware of Uncle Otis doing this kinda gangbusters business stuffing skunks but it looked like he had bought it all fairly recently. In the center of the room even, from floor to ceiling, was a gigantic box crushing machine like a huge piston stamp. The screen on the front of it read “Standby” and had a slowly blinking light underneath it labeled “Activation.” Seemed fancy and probably plot relevant.


“What bleeds does not always die…” a voice from the other side of the door filtered on waverly on the breeze beyond, muffled and garbled in the interim.


Dev sat up and pressed his back against some of the boxes, trying to make his already small frame as small and unnoticeable as possible.


“Beyond the mind it waits to breathe

the endless time and deeper seethe.

A crimson veil that hides the lie:

That what bleeds does not always die.”


And then silence.


For five straight minutes after the voice had ceased, Dev sat silently with his back pressed against the heavy filled shipping containers. He could feel the blood rushing through his veins, hear it in his ear drums, though the numbness of fear had rendered him almost completely immovable.


Deep within his mind the haunting, dithering words of the creature that had been just on the other side of that door turned over and over again. He had… heard them before, hadn’t he? He had been searching through the files in Gestalt’s database and had seen and read many horrific things but there had only been one video file in the entirety of their data.


A nearly pitch black video of a man sitting in a chair in the middle of a room, only his eyes and teeth barely visible in the darkness. He stared with wide, unblinking, hateful eyes right at the camera and slowly, methodically, spoke those words. It had haunted Dev for days afterward, he had looked over all their files a hundred times, but he had never opened that file again. Not once.


The file labeled “Incantation” had caused his dreams to hurt him.


“DEV!!” a voice suddenly exploded in his ear, causing him to launch his entire body back away from it into the heavy shipping crates and send them flying in every direction from the impact of his tiny nerd body against them. He sprawled out between them with gangly limbs, trying and failing to find purchase in the fallen stack to stand back up - basically flopping around like a fish and loudly crashing and banging wood and cardboard into each other for a good long while.


“JUST STOP FIGHTING IT! Stop trying to get up and just wait a fucking second! HEY STOP THRASHING and FUCKING grab onto one of the boxes! What are you DOING?!” the voice continued.


By the time Dev had finally settled at the bottom of a pile of smaller boxes, it had become fairly obvious who was screaming at him - unlikely as it seemed - standing over him, hands on his hips and rage on his face, was Jason Grace, completely and totally unharmed.


“How do you fuckin’ live like this?” Jason asked with a sneer and a shake of his head.


“I saw you get wrapped up in razor wire like a World War 1 soldier and dragged into sky hell by a giant butterfly!! How are you standing here judging me like nothing happened?!” Dev screamed out, sitting up after shifting around in the box pile a little.


“Do you hear the words that are coming out of your mouth, right now? Rush Hour.” Jason said, the last two words with an aside glance like it was natural. “You’re not making any god damn sense, man.”


“But…. but I saw it? It literally JUST happened!” Dev pointed back at the direction of the double doors. 


“Did the whole room turn red first?” Jason asked, shoving his hands into his jacket pockets.


“Well yeah…” Dev muttered, confused still.


“You haven’t figured out that’s when the monster does some kinda fuckin’ mind-control ass illusion shit yet? It happens like right before all kindsa freaky shit shows up every time and then everyone else doesn’t know what the fuck we’re babbbling about, yeah? It’s like 2 plus 2 shit, man.” Jason said with a derisive, judgemental shake of his head. “Aren’t you some kinda PhD in Dweebology or Virginomics or something?”


“Of course I figured it out!” Dev said, offended and struggling to get out of the boxes still (writer’s note: boy this would work better as a sight gag, huh?). He finally managed to get his chucks back on solid ground and dust off his overalls a little. “But we BOTH get caught in the illusion and whatever happens in it seems to happen to us for real at least. I figured that out first, I’ll have you know!”


He paused, then yelled, “ALSO I’M NOT A VIRGIN! There are girl nerds too!”


“Yeah, I bet.” Jason said with a look away.


“Let’s think about this logically…” Dev rubbed his chin, looking down at the ground and processing. “What I saw seemed pretty real, but you’re not torn up by guitar strings to death…”


“Sick ass way to go.” Jason said nonchalantly.


“But there was something on the other side of the door, wasn’t there…?” Dev continued, ignoring him.


“Look man, let’s just get the fuck out of here before anything else goes wrong, alright? We need to get you some HELP.” Jason motioned toward the door in the corner of the room with a dimly lit, barely functional “Exit” sign above it.


“I dunno, I’m not really feeling very safe to travel at the moment.” Dev returned.


“Look, Dev. We’re friends. We’ve been through a lot together, yeah? I’ll make certain you’re safe and sound and nothing happens to you. That’s what friends are for.” Jason said with a sincere smile.


Dev stared at him for a few seconds. He scrutinized him for the first time since he’d seen him before. He looked perfectly right - exactly how he’d remembered him before, right? There was only one way to be totally sure. Dev looked up.


“Man… you had to fuckin’ be a smart ass, didn’t you?” Jason said with a grin and a shrug. He drew his hand up from his side, as though nothing was there a moment again, a fireman’s axe now glinted in the suddenly crimson light of the room as he held it aloft. “I guess I’ll just fucking kill you and get it over with. Shame, really.”


“AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!” Dev screamed out in his normal blood-curtlingly high pitched manner and began to run at a full sprint away from Jason across the wide room toward it’s other side. “DON’TKILLME DON’TKILLME PLEEEAAASSEE!”


“Jesus fuck.” Jason muttered, chasing after him with an inhuman gait that crossed the entire room in several steps, his limbs elongating like in a dream with each heavy step. “Stop being such a bitch!”


“Well actually.” Dev stopped screaming and running suddenly, standing in place and slamming his hand into a digital console on one side of the gigantic box crusher machine at the center of the room. The machine whirred to life violently and primed the massive piston in the center of it to strike.


Jason stood in place about twenty feet across the wide open room away from it, shoulders slumped and eyebrow raised. “The fuck is that supposed to do? I’m nowhere fucking near it, Einstein.”


“Give it a second…. Just wait…. Hold on…” Dev said, staring at the screen and holding up a single finger toward the demonic apparition that looked like Jason that was trying to murder him violently with an axe.


“Can you just fucking lay down and die? This is getting embarassing.” Jason groaned.


“There!” Dev cried out.


The gigantic piston in the center of the room fired down into the hole in the center of it and into the floor below, dragging the cardboard under it down into a further series of smashing and grinding hammers below. 


For a moment, nothing seemed to have happened besides the machine exploding to life… but when it’s massive piston slammed back down again, Jason’s body was suddenly and violently yanked from it’s place in the floor and heaved closer to the machine in the center of the room, his head hitting concrete and his lungs violently decompressing in his chest as he landed on the floor.


“WHAT THE FUCK?!” Jason screamed out as the piston raised high into the air and smashed down hard once more, yanking Jasons body another six or seven feet across the floor in a sudden violent pull, his whole body scraping against the uneven concrete floor as it pulled him. “WHAT’S HAPPENING!?”


“You brainless buffoon! You chased me all around the room just like I knew you would! All it took was a little quick calculation to figure out exactly how to get your metal puppet strings tied into the box crusher! Now you’re going INTO it, head first! And from both directions too!” Dev cried out, proud of himself. He pointed up toward the ceiling, the wavy air there splitting and red light spilling out from it again. 


The same silhouette of the gigantic moth-winged woman was revealed amongst the burning red light, but she no longer seemed ethereal and angelic - now she was violently being yanked toward a fucking box crusher in the middle of a taxidermy shipping room - literally being dragged down from the sky from one direction toward it while her puppet Jason was being dragged into it from another.


The moth-creature screeched an inhuman, horrific screech as it fought against its sudden entrapment.


“And me? Well I’M GETTIN’ OUTTA HERE!” Dev then leapt into the air and spun his legs around in place like when Shaggy from Scooby Doo zoips the fuck out of spooky situations and then ZOOMS away from the danger toward the door labeled exit at the back, his feet making that choo-choo ch-ch-choo-ch-ch-chooo cartoon sound effect the entire time.


His lanky legs took him fast and far and he burst victorious out the back door into the cool night’s air with his head held high and his ego grown to bursting.


Just in time to catch the slightest look out of the corner of his eye at Uncle Otis swinging a shovel and bashing him directly in the head with it.


—------------------------------------------------------- 


Dev’s head swam as he slowly regained consciousness. On one hand, this had been the most physical activity he’d gotten up to since he had traveled cross-country to take part in the Pirates of Dark Water LARP adventure. They had a great turnout as well, almost every fan of that show made it - all ten of them. Jeff Pennington was the headlining celebrity taking part in the game. No one knew who he was. On the other hand, he’d not been physically beaten this hard since he’d told that Mac Store employee that you can put custom ringtones on other phones. It had been quite a day.


“Wh…where am…?” he managed to mutter out.


“Oh, he’s awake. Your friend finally joined us, Mr. Grace. Welcome to Whitesville, Mr. Durwood.” a sultry feminine voice pierced through the buzzing in Dev’s ears. 


He managed to open his bleary eyes enough to see a beautiful woman standing in front of him, looking at him like a shark eyes chum. She was tall, and strangely thin, but with high cheekbones and beautiful features nonetheless. She had long, flowing white-blonde hair braided in places and a flowy glittery 1970’s style long dress. She looked quite out of place after everything he’d seen that day.


“For fuck’s sakes…” a familiar male voice made it through the haze as well. Dev looked over to see the side profile of Jason’s face glaring at the woman in front of them. Dev peered up to see that Jason was dangling from some kind of extremely chunky metal pieces of machinery around his hands. Upon looking down the same kind of machinery had come up all the way to his mid-calfs. 


“We… we went to… a bondage party…?” Dev muttered, noticing he was shackled by the same kind of strange metal machinery.


“Oh you very much wish.” The thin woman said with a smirk. “No, I’m afraid you’re currently prisoners of Gestalt. Both of you know far, far too much.”


“Look, I dunno SHIT lady!” Jason spat out.


“I don’t doubt that.” she said with a look of disgust and a turn away from Jason. “But you definitely have seen too much. You saw Snake in action, you saw what I can do. Neither of you will be leaving here anytime soon so I would strap in and get comfortable.” She paused, tapping her long fingernail against the metal machinery around Dev’s hands. “Oh, I see you already have. Excellent.”


“Jason…?” Dev muttered out, more clearly now.


“Yeah, Dev?” Jason said with annoyance in his voice, his eyes darting around the dark room they were being held in. He could make out some kind of wood on the walls and a piece of machinery here and there but not much else.


“I’m glad you’re not dead.” Dev said with a weak smile.


Jason sighed a heaving sigh. “Thanks, Dev.”


“Enough, this isn’t The Love Boat,” the thin woman scoffed. “Now, Mr. Grace. You will answer some questions for me.”


“What could I possibly be able to tell you? I don’t even know what the fuck is even going on.” Jason spat.


“You will stop your ridiculous tough guy act and tell me right now… Where is Pavlov Flinch?!” the thin woman said with vitriol in her voice.


“Wh…what? The freaky little Craigslist private eye that smelled like cheese?” Jason said disgustedly, “YOU got him. The cops picked him up when we crashed!”


“He managed to escape custody.” The thin woman said disappointedly. “He was screaming what little he remember of the lyrics to “Fuck the Police” at the top of his lungs over and over so the guards tried to restrain him. When one of them put their hand over his mouth, he licked their palm. Apparently during the severe and completely legal beating afterward he snuck the guard’s keyring and let himself out later that night.”


“ACAB.” both Jason and Dev said in unison.


“Look, Mr. Grace…” the thin woman said with a wry smile as she approached him and leaned against his dangling body. “You and I could be… very, very close if you were to cooperate with me. I would love to get to know a big… strong man… like you, much much better.” She snaked her finger around his chest and licked her lips close to his.


Jason recoiled away from her as best he could, gritting his teeth as he did. “I’M GAY YOU DUMB FUCKING BITCH.”


“Worth a shot.” the thin woman said with a shrug. “Torture it is, then!”


“W-wait! You could get to know me better! I’m full of information you could rub out of me!” Dev cried out, rattling the metal machinery which kept him dangling from the ceiling as he yanked against it.


“I’d… rather not.” the thin woman said with a shake of her head.


“Just let the nerd go already, god damnit! He doesn’t know anything about any of this shit!” Jason said with a growl.


“Well actually, I have a terabyte worth of their most secret files in a secure location set to go out to every conspiracy and cryptid website on the planet Earth should I not enter a password every twenty four hours to keep it hidden!” Dev said with a swaggering smirk on his face. “Ya wanna do business with me now, baby?”


“Jesus fuckin’ christ.” Jason said, shaking his head.


“We already knew about all of that.” the thin woman said plainly. “Look, before either of you two buffoons tell me any more of your life secrets, let me just say this. The torture is preliminary. If either of you survive it without giving up the information we seek then we’ll just turn you into horrible abominations we can mind control and have you tell us then. That’s just kind of expensive and time consuming so we don’t jump right to it.”


“Oh….” Dev said, his eyes wide and his mouth dropped.


“Me being gay isn’t a life secret.” Jason said with contempt in his voice. 


“Whateveeerrrrrr, I’ll be back in a second with a lot of sharp things to put inside you.” The thin woman said with a giddy chuckle and disappeared into the darkness.


There was a long, long moment of silence as both men just hung there in the darkness.


“Dev, how did you know the fake Jason wasn’t me, anyway?” Jason said with a glance out of the corner of his eyes. 


“He was nice to me.” Dev said matter-of-factly. “That’s how I can tell you’re really you now, too.”


“God damn...” Jason returned.


—----------------------------------------------------------------------


The stove burner seared the underside of the cast iron and the sizzle of oil inside of it said it was time already. 

T.K.  upturned the small bowl of chopped up potatoes coated in spices and cheese into it, the sizzle rising to a loud, crackling harmony. She smiled as she tilted her head and looked over at the recipe printed out with wrinkly old printer paper on the counter next to the stove.


“Try not to burn my uncle's house to the ground, please. He doesn’t even know we’re staying here.” Alyssa called from the living room with a sly grin on her face. She placed her feet up on the ottoman and leaned back into the old lady couch she had made her second home since they had arrived a week ago. Her uncle’s house in Whitesville was the perfect escape from the horrors of Kirby, or so they stupidly thought cause they don’t listen to this great show.


“VERY funny.” T.K. returned with her own grin. “I haven’t burnt anything since the first night we got here. And fish is hard to cook! Everybody knows that. Ask Gordon Ramsey! Ask Cooking Mama! All the greats!”


“Yo, who’s Cooking Mama? She sounds HAWT, bro!” Dips popped down from the ceiling, his head and shoulders upside down like he was swimming in the popcorn plaster up there. 


The studio audience goes nuts when they see him. They all have to stand there for a full 45 seconds until they stop applauding and going ‘OWWWW!’.


“You promised me you’d lay low while we were here for a while, Dips!” T.K. hissed out at him under her breath, trying to be as quiet as possible. Alyssa hadn’t quite gotten used to the idea of a teenage ghost boy tagalong to their lives in the way that T.K. had. Though she wasn’t quite sure WHY she was so chill with it. Maybe because he was so chill? Maybe because T.K.’s lack of responsibility and attachment to the real world had made it easier overall? Maybe the writer is putting too much of himself into a slacker character in a podcast story? Who knows the reason.


“It’s been a week though, homie. You can’t keep me locked up upstairs like I’m Flowers in the Attic, dude! I don’t even got a sister!” Dips wandered across the ceiling to peer into the living room where Alyssa was watching some kind of motocross event on the giant wall television in the living room.


“That’s a fucked up thing to say publicly.” T.K. waved him away. “Just gimme until tomorrow, ok?”


“You got it, dudette! I’m gonna do my untethered ghostly wanderings around town thing for a while anyway. You want me to pick up anything from the store?” Dips asked helpfully. “I’m dead so like, I ain’t got no money or nothin’ but it’s probably not illegal to steal if you’re dead, yeah? Like they probably forgot to write that into the rules like in Air Bud, dawg. Or Air Bud: Golden Reciever. Or Air Bu–”


“Just GO, Dips! Thank you!” T.K. interrupted.


“Right-o, Babe-o!” and Dips popped back up into the ceiling, disappearing.


Alyssa walked into the kitchen with her eyebrows raised. “I think you miiiiight be burning the potatoes.”


“SHIT!” T.K. yelled out, running over and yanking the pan off the heat. The potatoes weren’t pitch black but they weren’t far off. “Damnit, man… I’m sorry, Alyssa, I got distracted.”


“By the ghost in our attic, I know.” she said with a shake of her head. “I wish you didn’t try to pretend he didn’t come with us. What am I, stupid? He eats every bag of cheetos I ever come in contact with. I didn’t even know ghosts ate!” Alyssa looked around. “I guess we could order something. Do you think anything in town is open?”


“I dunno… this whole town seems like… I dunno… half populated? Like every other house is empty and the neighbors we do have just constantly stare at us.” T.K. rubbed at her forehead. “I just get a really, really bad feeling about this place, I guess…”


‘Could it be…. Haunted?” Alyssa said with a giant grin.


“You’re hilarious. You ever think of doing standup? You could be the next Dane Cook.” She faked an angry look and the two laughed out loud together for a short while.


When the laughter died down they just kinda stood there… looking at each other. The moment hung on the air. There was a strange magnetism in the air. Neither of them could break their eye contact and the space between them seemed to slowly disappear.


But then Dips popped in and fuckin’ ruined it like a god damn sitcom ass neighbor. “WHOA, DUDETTES! You’re NEVER gonna believe what I saw down the street, dude!”


“DIPS GOD DAMNIT!!” T.K. screamed out. Both Alyssa and Dips jerked back away from her in shock at the sudden outburst. She looked between them and then awkwardly smiled. “Wh…what is it?”


“You dudes just gotta trust me… we gotta fuckin REAL big problem in this town, dude. And I DON’T mean the lack of tasty pizza places!”


The three of them exchanged looks.


“Yo wait were you two about to snarf faces?” Dips said with a gigantic grin.


THE END OR TO BE CONTINUED I DON’T KNOW ALL THESE STORIES CONNECT
