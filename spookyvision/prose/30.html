<p>
	New York, New York, Fall 1934. Entry 9.
</p>
<p>
	Work ain’t the steadiest when you’re so repulsive to the eye that nine outta ten doctors recommend people with weak hearts don’t look directly at you. Just look at that fuckhole Joanie Loves Chachi kid. There’s your anachronism right out the gate by the way, fuck you.
</p>
<p>
	My point is, when I got a call last week from a representative of one of the biggest crime families in the city with the promise of a lot of money for a little work, I jumped at it like a rabid dog. Contrary to popular belief I’m like every other workin’ stiff in this burgh - I still gotta eat to live and drink to keep wanting to.
</p>
<p>
	It was a simple job for the Spaghetoni Family - hired muscle for a meeting with some kinda eastern european mob reps for some sort of mysterious deal I was just smart enough to know not to ask any questions about. The deal was going down at the palatial estate of one Armando Garibaldi - a longtime enforcer for the Spaghetoni Family who was known for his ruthlessness just as much as he was known for the irony in a completely bald man having his last name. I had heard tale many a mook found a brand spankin’ new pair of cement shoes under the Christmas tree after pointin’ out the irony in that. No thanks, I swim bad enough as it is. My left leg knows what it’s doin’ but I guess the rest of my parts weren’t strong swimmers.
</p>
<p>
	The estate was cush, with enough rooms to board the entire Garibaldi arm of the family alongside the mountain of submachine guns and pipe bombs it took to keep the Spaghetoni Crime Family in the business. This guy was the center of their entire armed operation and seemed to have his finger on the pulse of new and horrifying weapons like no other. The type of goon to get his hands on the newest nerve gas before the American Goverment had used it on their first South American government official. I’m talkin’ FAST.
</p>
<p>
	I was stationed at the doors to the meeting hall, which was fine by me. There was always the chance that standing too close to an arms deal would land you the less-than-coveted opportunity to be the first guy dead on the floor fulla whatever new bullet or bomb they had just signed the papers for. What was it with criminals and just offing their own henchmen right in front of everyone? You’d think that’d just make it harder to fill the position again knowing what could come of it - and Monster.com and Indeed ain’t gonna help shit in 1933 or whenever this is set, I don’t fuckin’ know. 
</p>
<p>
	“You, the big guy.” one of the suited up goombas across the room called out. I tilted my head up to glance him over - he was the kind of guy who’s entire job in the organization seemed to be to take up space and carry a gun. Somehow even that little bit of power had gone to his head.
</p>
<p>
	“You deaf on top of being ugly, freak?” he followed up, bridging the gap between us like he wasn’t gonna come up to nipple-high at best once he got over to me. Which he did. He pointed his stumpy little finger up at me without noticing, though.
</p>
<p>
	“You better sheath that finger back into your fist before I break it off like a Kit-Kat, bitch.” I said without much inflection, peering down at him from underneath the low-brimmed fedora my employer had forced me to wear for the occasion. Something about hiding my prize-winning beauty from the customers.
</p>
<p>
	“HUH? YOU are backsassin’ ME?” he said with a slight chuckle, turning to face the rest of the mugs in the room. There were two other bodyguards like myself - one on the other side of the double doors with a slack-jawed hazy-eyed expression that just screamed booze loud enough to even be audible over the smell of it on him - and one on the other side of the room standing by a back door just behind the meeting table with a steely glare that coulda melted the butter off your mom’s ass cheeks. The four men seated at the table speaking in hushed tones to Garabaldi didn’t even notice his bluster. 
</p>
<p>
	“You gotta sass before you can backsass.” I spat out in return, shoving my hands into the pockets of my slacks. I really missed my overcoat, but again, I’d been dressed up like a performing monkey for the role and only had a two-piece linen suit and striped tie to my name. Besides the magnum slung low under my left arm, anyway.
</p>
<p>
	“....what?” The little man said, his eyebrows knitting up the center of his forehead into a cascade of confused wrinkles. “Don’t try to play no mind games with me, ya penny dreadful fucker!”
</p>
<p>
	He haphazardly snatched the grip of his pistol up and out of its holster but before he could clear leather I’d bashed him across the jaw and sent him spinning onto the floor like a loose dreidel. The crumpled thud of his body turned every head in the joint at me, leaving a room full of wide eyes and clenched jaws - and even a few grabbed up pieces ready to blow the brains out of whoever or whatever they next peeped at.
</p>
<p>
	“God damnit, Frankie.” Garibaldi groaned out, standing up from the table and waving his hands in the air to signal everyone else to cool it and get back to business. They followed his order without a single word. He moved across the room to me like a man in control of the space, easy steps like an animal unburdened by predators - and surrounded by hapless prey. He was bald, that was fact, but he was built like a brick shit house and dressed to the nine’s in a way that screamed he wasn’t somebody to fuck with physically or financially. Armani suit, crocodile shoes, tinted Gucci eyeglasses, the whole works. Unless one of those things didn’t exist in this time period, then he was wearing something else. I’m not lookin’ it up.
</p>
<p>
	“Apologies, Mr. Garibaldi.” I swallowed my pride as the words escaped my lips. It was a damn good payday, you woulda done the same shit, don’t judge me, you FUCK. “The shrimp was about to pull his piece on me. Figured a little slap would be better for business than a gunshot.”
</p>
<p>
	Garibaldi smirked and nodded his head in agreement, clapping his hands on either side of my arms as high as he could reach, “You make a good point, actually. Nevermind the dressin’ down. Just do me a favor and dump him in the green room and let him sleep it off before our guests arrive, eh?”
</p>
<p>
	“You got it.” I said flatly, bending down and picking up the little man’s body with both arms and cradling him like a baby as I lifted him. I was careful the entire time to show that bygones were bygones and I was gonna treat the little squirt with respect for the boss's sake. But once I’d slipped out of the meeting hall and across the halfway beyond the doors into the green room I just tossed him into the middle of the floor like a bag of dog shit on a neighbors porch. The old man reading a book by the fireplace in the corner peered over the top of the page, huffed out his complaint silently, then went back to what he was doing. Must’ve been a pretty regular occurrence.
</p>
<p>
	I made it back across the hall just in time to hold open the double doors for the congregation from Eastern Europe - Romania or somethin’? I’m just gonna say Romania from now on, fuck it.  There was the usual cast of ne’er-do-wells and open-shirted triggermen showing way too much hairy chest that goes along with any deal of the sort, but one sight caught me so off guard I must’ve did a quadruple take that woulda snapped my neck if it wasn’t sewn into place.
</p>
<p>
	There amongst the middle of the grim retinue was a 10 year old blonde girl wearing a silken dress with poofy little sleeves and silver slippers. To top it all off the only thing that could’ve made her seem more out of place was sitting atop her curly blonde head - a diamond encrusted tiara made of silver and gilded gold alloy.
</p>
<p>
	“Ahhh, welcome my friends!” Garibaldi called out from the end of the meeting table, standing up and motioning with one hand for his minions to do the same. With the entire room on their feet, the leader of the Romanian procession stalked across the room to shove his hand into Garibaldi’s and flash a toothy snake’s smile. “Mr. Uchenko, welcome to New York City.”
</p>
<p>
	“It is a pleasure.” the thick-jawed man said, drawing his hand back and reaching into his coat pocket for a bundle of crinkled papers which he immediately handed over to Garibaldi. The two men took their seats near the head of the meeting table and everyone else filed into their places along either side of it - splitting the American and Romanian gangsters directly down the center. There was an unease on both sides that was deeply palpable, but I was having much more trouble reconciling Lil’ Slavic Shirley Temple being at this inter-mafia pow-wow. 
</p>
<p>
	“How long will this take, Ivan?” the little girl looked up to the rather effete man standing next to her twirling at the end of his handlebar mustache.
</p>
<p>
	He looked down at her and then seemed suddenly startled, as if remembering his place, and bowed his head down repeatedly to her as he spoke, “We will only be a moment, your majesty. Your father wished for you to attend this business meeting to assure everything went smoothly.”
</p>
<p>
	The mustached handler she had called Ivan glanced from the corner of his eye across the room with a slight desperation on his face - directly at the man who had been called Uchenko earlier. He flashed that predators smile back at him and suddenly the entire situation made a little more sense to me. Or at least as well as I could put together. 
</p>
<p>
	I had heard on the Lawrence Welk show… wait that doesn’t happen until the 1950’s…uh… the… radio show… that Princess Swarova of Romania was visiting New York City on a cultural exchange trip in order to view our museums and libraries. A good-will ambassador’s trip that was meant to cover up the arrival of the Romanian mob on our shores. I couldn’t piece together whether or not the good ol’ king had sent his daughter willingly or not but I was well-aware that her being at this meeting was a matter of convenience far more than one of necessity.
</p>
<p>
	“Are you listening?” a hoarse whisper woke me from my detective reverie. The mustached handler stood directly in front of me, holding Princess Swarova’s hand as they both peered up at me with hard, judgemental eyes. I tried to meet their gaze but something about it felt seeringly familiar to the burdensome eyes of a family I had once hoped to be my own so very long ago. I simply shook my head. The mustached handler looked down at the Princess, who upturned her lip in annoyance, then returned his gaze to me. “You must move and allow the Princess to sit in that chair behind you. You are impeding her, which I do not advise.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh uh… yeah. Be my guest.” I muttered, taking a few steps to the side to stand against the wall. I pulled my hat brim down further over my eyes and leaned against the wall, mustering as much of my nonchalance as possible - though I was very much chalanced at the entire situation. Tough guys with guns and backdoor business deals were one thing but having toddlers with tiaras in my peripheral vision at the same time was too confusing for my patchwork-ass brain to figure.
</p>
<p>
	“Hmph!” the mustached handler scoffed out, guiding the Princess to sit in the seat he had garnered for her. He was portly, and weak-chinned, but still carried an air of importance and an even-keeled nature that made it hard to judge him. He stood next to her from the moment they arrived, and continued his vigilance then, clasping his hands together behind his back and rocking back and forth on his heels. 
</p>
<p>
	The meeting itself was nothin to write home about even though that’s exactly what I’m doing right now. That is until the Romanian group’s lead man pulled out a small glowing vial from his breast pocket and held it up to the light. A strange mineral was inside - a stone of some kind maybe? And it was reflecting light like a cats eyes in the night. He placed it down on the table and everyone there leaned over to stare at it with the exact same level of incredulousness I was stewing in.
</p>
<p>
	“This is it…?” Garibaldi said with a lip upturned in disgust. “I thought you said–”
</p>
<p>
	“I stand by what I said.” Uchenko snapped, placing his finger on the vial and rolling over on the table. “This isn’t the bomb. This is the number one ingredient in it, though. The vital piece.”
</p>
<p>
	“This? There’s no like…” Garibaldi looked between his henchmen for a moment before continuing, “ Uh.. like TNT or anything? It’s just… this?”
</p>
<p>
	“Explaining the manner in which the bomb operates isn’t really within my purview, Mr. Garibaldi. I am no man of science. I am a business man. I promised you a bomb capable of holding a city for ransom and I will deliver it to you.” Uchenko said, picking up the vial and holding it back up to the light. I was standing entranced across the room, staring at it in the same way everyone else seemed to be, save the Princess and her handler.
</p>
<p>
	“I dunno… a uh… what’d you call it?” Garibaldi stuttered.
</p>
<p>
	“We call it the Uranium Bomb.” Uchenko said plainly.
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, yeah. I guess it’s just difficult to make this expensive a purchase without a showcase of what it’s capable of.” Garibaldi looked around the room with pointed, vicious eyes. He was most assuredly looking for which henchman to kill in front of everyone there. I rolled my eyes.
</p>
<p>
	“As was explained to you via wire, if the bomb was to go off within city limits it would make your New York City uninhabitable for fifty or more years. There can be no test run.”
</p>
<p>
	That made my blood run cold. I mean… colder than usual. It moves around in there so I imagine it’s not fully frigid. Still, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. The Spaghetoni Family was protection rackets and gun running, what in the holy fuck could they possibly need a bomb capable of fucking up an entire city for half a century for, anyway?
</p>
<p>
	I didn’t have much time to debate with myself thanks to the sudden, violent coughing happening everywhere around me. I was roused by the reality of the sound and whipped my head around the room to figure out what the hell was happening so suddenly. Then the night took a real wild ass turn I still can’t fully explain.
</p>
<p>
	There was a strange green smoke filtering in through the double doors into the room, rolling across the room like water and raising into the air slowly but all at once as if by some unseen command. It looked like it had been filling the room for hours at this point, but it had JUST appeared, I was sure of it.
</p>
<p>
	“What the fuck?!” Garibaldi screamed out, unsheathing his pistol from its sling around his midsection just as every mook in the room did the same. “What game are you fuckin’ slavs playing me for?!”
</p>
<p>
	“We are not doing this! She has found us!” Uchenko screamed out between coughs, turning his gun toward the double doors and shakily aiming at them.
</p>
<p>
	For their part the double doors snaked open, creaking upon their hinges, revealing a blindingly bright green light on the other side of them. Everyone took a step back, the smog beginning to choke at their lungs and sting their eyes, and for my part I tried to cover my mouth with my ugly ass work tie and squint my eyes through the haze to see our attacker.
</p>
<p>
	Honestly, even then I couldn’t believe my eyes.
</p>
<p>
	Standing in the doorway, wearing a long black evening gown with a large black stole around her neck and a wide brimmed black sunhat on her head, was broadway muscial superstar Ursula Redgrave. I had never been to Broadway, mind you, and even I knew exactly who she was. I’d seen her face on countless posters, giant marquees, billboards, magazine ads, tijuana bibles, anything and everywhere you could imagine. And there she stood - ringed on either side by blinding green light and slithering green smoke.
</p>
<p>
	And perhaps even stranger, that smoke seemed to emanate from the tip of her cigarette which she held out from her hip on a long, thin cigarette holder. She smiled a bright, white, perfect smile from between her parted black lips and giggled a raspy, haughty laugh to no one in particular.
</p>
<p>
	For a moment, everyone in the room stared in complete disbelief.
</p>
<p>
	“You all know why I’m here.” she said with an otherworldly cadence and reverb, her voice seeming to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.
</p>
<p>
	“FUCKING ICE THIS BROADWAY BITCH!” interrupted the screaming voice of Garibaldi, his finger squeezing the trigger of his revolver again and again to let fly every bullet in its chamber at Ms. Redgrave. Every mobster in the room, save myself if I even really count since I’m a freelancer really, opened fire on the woman in the black dress in the doorway, explosive caps bursting off in such succession as to be deafening.
</p>
<p>
	She simply held her hand up and every bullet in the air stopped, popped like popcorn, and fell to the ground as fully budded black roses, flittering onto the floor with silence and grace.
</p>
<p>
	We all stared slack jawed then and the mobsters stood stock-still with terror which suddenly changed their violent hot blood to ice water in their veins. 
</p>
<p>
	“Hm…” Ms. Redgrave looked around the room for a moment and once her eyes landed on me she smiled a knowing smile. She turned her open palm to a pointing finger which landed upon me. “You.”
</p>
<p>
	I don’t really remember her walking across the room to me, but she was definitely right in front of me then so she must’ve had to. She looked up at me and placed her finger onto my chest with enough force to press in and hurt a little. “You’ll do nicely. Do be a dear and take care of these brutes for me.”
</p>
<p>
	She whispered something then. I don’t really remember what. Some kind of old language maybe, but I couldn’t make it out. But I remember being so tired suddenly. Maybe not tired cause I didn’t feel that fatigue in my bones or anything, but just… sleepy I guess? Is the best way to put it. But I couldn’t keep my eyes open anymore. I just passed out. Flat.
</p>
<p>
	I had these dreams. Flashes of dreams, really. They were so damn vivid, I could feel them. Violent, hateful nightmares. I could feel my hands around someones throat, squeezing the life out of them again. I hadn’t done that in a lifetime, and swore off of it not just for my health but for the health of angry villagers everywhere, but in the dream I couldn’t stop. I bashed heads in, threw people around, smashed and ripped and tore. I genuinely could not stop.
</p>
<p>
	And in the distance I heard a little girl scream for help as someone dragged her away. I can almost remember the specific face of the man who leapt to help her but I… I stopped him. I ripped him away and tore the life out of him. The mustached handler, maybe? It was all such a blur.
</p>
<p>
	Of course I have the benefit of hindsight writin’ this and lemme tell you - they ain’t just whistlin’ dixie when they say that shit’s 20/20. 
</p>
<p>
	Aaaaaanyway.
</p>
<p>
	I woke up face down on the ground. It wasn’t the plush carpet of Garibaldi’s estate anymore that pressed against my cheek either - but the hard metal and sodden earth of an all-too familiar surface. I pressed my hands into it and pushed myself up, desperately blinking the bleariness out of my eyes. When I could finally see more than a few inches in front of me I was greeted by yet another fucking boat hatch. This time I wasn’t in a free-standing cage but an actual brig built into the ship - the bars reaching from floor to ceiling. At least there weren’t any fish and/or fuckers of fish to be found this time around.
</p>
<p>
	“For fuck’s sakes…” I whispered to myself, feeling around for the gun under my arm to find nothing in its place, not even a Chaco Taco for consolation. 
</p>
<p>
	“The demon awakes.” a familiar voice hit my ears like a ton of bricks. I gripped my forehead in a vain attempt to stop the pounding in my head and squinted into the darkness past the bars as well as I could. There, sitting in a wooden chair placed dead center of the empty room outside of the bars, was the man I’d learned was named Uchenko at the meeting. He looked quite banged up but much more angry than hurt.
</p>
<p>
	“Demon…? Where the hell am I? What happened?” I sputtered, wobbling over to the bars and grasping onto them to keep my balance.
</p>
<p>
	“You were used by the witch. You killed Garibaldi and most of his men. You killed a few of my men before we subdued you.” Uchenko stood up and began pacing back and forth along the distance of the room.
</p>
<p>
	“The… the witch…? Ursula Redgrave?” I said with pure confusion in my voice. I still couldn’t believe she’d attacked a mob arms deal with a bunch of weird green smoke or whatever the hell I wrote earlier, I’m not scrollin’ up if I’m not doing research. “I… I guess she did some wild hocus pocus with the bullets and shit…she’s a witch?”
</p>
<p>
	Uchenko nodded and I pressed my forehead against the metal bars, the cold surface barely soothing the booming headache behind my eyes. “Damn.”
</p>
<p>
	“Damn is an understatement. You owe much more of a blood debt to our organization than you could fathom, demon.” Uchenko closed the distance between us and stared directly into my eyes with a burning red hatred of his own. “The witch has taken Princess Swarova. If the king finds out about this there will be no survivors left of your rampage. Not even you. We will all die horrible, violent deaths, not fit for a dog.”
</p>
<p>
	“I like dogs…” I said, not really being capable of thinking of much else clever to say at the moment.
</p>
<p>
	Uchenko stared at me without changing expression and then re-buttoned his suit jacket and began pacing once more.
</p>
<p>
	“Can’t believe witches are fuckin’ real… what else is gonna pop out and say boo…” I muttered, mostly to myself, as Uchenko worked on what to say next.
</p>
<p>
	“You have 24 hours.” he finally broke his silence.
</p>
<p>
	“To what?” I responded after a moment of silence.
</p>
<p>
	“To retrieve Princess Swarova and return her to this boat alive and well. If you fail, you will suffer a fate far worse than death.” he turned his eyes back toward me, hatred boiling behind the retina.
</p>
<p>
	“...and then the king’ll kill us all. Right?” I half-smiled, much to Uchenko’s great annoyance, but he nodded in return.
</p>
<p>
	“He will salt the Earth. He will kill us, our families, our friends, everyone who we have ever cared about.”
</p>
<p>
	“So he’ll be killing me, me, and me, then.” I muttered.
</p>
<p>
	“24 hours, demon. Now go.” Uchenko pulled a large switch on the wall at the far side of the room and the old rusted bars of the cell raised up from the floor, giving me just enough room to duck under them and step out into the main room.
</p>
<p>
	“You’re being pretty understanding for a guy who’s employees I just slaughtered under brainwashing or whatever the hell happened.” I said as I walked past Uchenko to the large open doorway he stood beside at the other end of the room.
</p>
<p>
	“This is not the first time the witch has troubled us. If you survive this… and return the Princess unharmed… we will see how…. Understanding… I can be for you.” He flashed his hateful predator’s eyes at me once more and then motioned for me to leave.
</p>
<p>
	So there I stood, on the docks of the Hudson River, staring up at New York City looming over me like a hangman, casting a damn long shadow from the morning sun raising beyond it. I had not even one clue for how to find Ursula Redgrave, no idea what the hell she could possibly want with Princess Swarova of Romania, hell I didn’t even really know what the hell Redgrave WAS or what she was capable of doing.
</p>
<p>
	All I knew was that I had 24 hours to find and return the girl or there wasn’t gonna be a movie deal with these case files. I’d be lucky if the different parks of me got to have their own shallow graves for a second time.
</p>
<p>
	But hey… cliffhangers sell books, right?
</p>
<p>
	To Be Continued
</p>
