Stop or My Mummy Will Shoot!

A Frankenstein, PI Mystery

Prompts: Casinos & Cimelords

From the Case Files of Adam Frankenstein, Private Investigator.

New York, New York, Fall 1934. Entry 1.

I haven’t written anything down since the 1700’s under some family’s floorboards so forgive me if I’m a little rusty at it. Let’s get a few things out of the way right out the gate to make reading the rest of this a little less ridiculous.

Yes, I am THAT Frankenstein. The monster from the book. Let’s not get fucking pedantic and start talking about how that was the Doctor’s name and my name was ‘The Creature’ or some horse shit. Do you realize how insulting and offensive that is to call another person? And I’m at least 6 other people stitched together. Have some manners. Besides, I pretty clearly told good ol’ Vic that my name is Adam. So use it. And besides, if the only thing that dweeby little peener ever gave me was an objectively stupid last name, it would at least be something.

“But Frankenstein” I hear you gibbering and drooling at the pages of this journal, “didn’t you freeze to death in the arctic after you felt bad about Victor dying?” and the answer to that is yes and no. Yes I froze to death, no I didn’t really feel that bad.

I got electrocuted back to life by a different mad scientist about 5 years ago in a rundown tenement in Flatbush. Never really caught his name. I think there’s a pizza place or a Dentist there now but there used to be the biggest fucking tesla coils you ever saw in your life in there. Shocked me right back to the land of the living - or as close to it as I get anyway. Left a HUGE scorch mark on my taint that never quite healed right, too. It looks like the parting of the red sea down there when I haven’t applied ointment weekly.

Uh, anyway.

After I woke up and strangled the mad scientist to death in a fit of blind animal rage I really got to thinkin’ about my life and where I was headed. I had no direction! I’m a pretty clever guy - especially at tracking down people. I found every one of Victor Frankenstein’s relatives without even knowing how to read a map, across a damn continent, no less. Let’s not get into what I did once I found ‘em but that seemed like a marketable skill to me.

So I set up a private investigations service, real on the downlow for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that I’m a 7 foot tall jigsaw puzzle of dead bodies. Unfortunately what this means for me is I end up doing a lot of graveyard work, and I don’t mean late nights. Every time some spooky ass ghoul or errant werewolf hits the town they call me and I need the work, so off I run. It’s a living I guess, if you’ll excuse the pun.

Anyway, let’s get to the case part of this case file.

About a week ago I got a call from a very important customer - a representative of a local crime family on the rise that wanted to hire me for some snooping business. I don’t pick and choose with the degenerate scumbags I work for so I wasn’t opposed to it, depending on what was being asked of me.

I was told to come to The Great Pyramid, a grand casino that took up way too much real estate on Long Island for the locals' taste and looked like an eyesore that wouldn’t be matched until the Great Bass Pro Shop Pyramid almost a hundred years from now. Don’t ask questions about how I could possibly know that, just listen to the damn story. I had my meeting set up with the biggest wig of the bunch for a couple days off.

By the time I was walking into the plush head office and VIP backrooms of The Great Pyramid I knew pretty much everything there was to know about my new employers. The Gabagool Crime Family was the most infamous mafia group this side of the Hudson and had been making short work of their rivals since beginning their meteoric rise to power in the city. This part of town was once completely owned by their main rivals - The HEY I’M WALKIN’ HERE! Crime Family - but they had been all but wiped out through business and warfare by this point.

The head office was beyond opulence, treading into the kind of hubris that would get you Sodom & Gammorah’d. The entire room was gold from top to bottom, with a brick motif built into it to look mildly and inoffensively Egyptian in style. Palm trees lined the walls and gigantic Egyptian murals hung daunting above telling stories no one here could give a shit less about that used to mean the entirety of the world to a people.

Seated on what may as well be a velvet throne for the size of it, at the head of a massive mahogany table dressed from one side to the other with golden trinkets and baubles to make King Midas blush was the head of the family himself, Don Guiseppe Macaroni the Third. He was a widely built man that carried the weight like he was once a heavyweight boxer and had hardly ever been on the receiving end of a loss. Time had dragged all of that down to the Earth though, both literally and figuratively. Dude was fuckin’ droopy.

The Don had the sloped, jowely face that could have belonged to a man of 60 or a man of 600 equally, and he slouched low in his chair, staring with cold indifference behind eyebrows bushier than even the wild foliage that surrounded the golden room he presided over.

He waved me over to stand before the desk and a short, thin man with a heavy wool suit and a pencil thin mustache, fanned himself with the fringes of a handkerchief. He looked like a candlestick had come to life and was about to sing showtunes but that’s another reference I shouldn’t know yet so let’s move on. He greeted me with a voice far too commanding and controlling than a man like him deserved.

“Welcome Mr. Frankenstein, if that’s what you wish to call yourself, to the Great Pyramid Casino.” the thin man said with a grand sweeping arm gesture.

“Alright.” I managed to return, gazing around the room with a practiced cool indifference I find tends to put people off their game. There’s a big part of me that just genuinely enjoys being a giant prick and making people mad on purpose. I’m a monster, I know.

For his part the thin man did seem annoyed but hid it well. “...well it’s just strange that you make yourself out to be a character from a storybook. Do you get many clients that way? It seems an odd marketing choice.”

“Look, my fine bitch, do we have business to attend to or don’t we? I was promised a job and I showed up. I could be dressed like Little Bo Peep and you’d be handing over my sheep counting money happily if I got the job done’, right?” I snapped back, getting a little bit annoyed at being asked why I was pretending to be me for the thousandth time.

“Well, I never!” the thin man spat out at me, holding his handkerchief to his face. “Don’t you know who you’re addressing, you pallid brute?! I am the personal assistant to the Don himself, Angelo! If you–”

Angelo got cut off at this point by the Don raising a weak old hand in the air and gesturing towards him. He leaned down and nodded as the Don spoke to him in a raspy old man voice, the kind that absolutely no one could understand and we all just nod politely to in public and try not to think about how sad that shit is. That kind. Angelo seemed to genuinely understand though, which was the reason for his employment, I imagined.

“The Don wishes for me to shut my fucking shithole and…” Angelo paused, reeling from having to repeat his own insults out loud. “...and just get on with the job. Fine, yes, good…”

He motioned for me to sit in a chair nearby and I didn’t. This made him visibly uncomfortable and frustrated. I smiled.

“Yes.. well. There have been a number of our employees who have come in to work, never been seen leaving, and disappearing with large sums of our casino’s profits for the night. They’re seen throughout their entire shift, not one of our security guards sees them ever leave the building through either the front or side entrances, and we never see them again after. We’re missing something like 14 thousand dollars at this point.”

“Security guards are on the take. You can make the check out to A. Frankenstein. I get why that’s funny but I don’t wanna fuckin’ hear about it. “ I said, cutting off his extended exposition dump, convenient as it was for the reader.

Angelo began to laugh, and The Don laughed a wheezing sad old man laugh that slumped his shoulders up and down, and I was suddenly aware of four other men standing in the shadows of the room around us laughing as well. Black suits, sunglasses, and fedoras, each one holding a hand on a pistol tucked into the front of their pants, as if trained for that stance specifically. Made sense to me they’d keep some strongarms around for protection but I gotta admit I was impressed they managed to be so stealthy around me.

“Oh no, Mr. Frankenstein, our security force is made up entirely of Gabagool Family members. Each one of them has sworn a lifedebt and given up their autonomy for the good of the family. None would be capable of turning against us, the penalty is far too steep. Not to mention 14 thousand is nothing to a family member. We make that in a week.” Angelo snickered like a bitch, rubbing at his pencil thin mustache in a manner that made me wanna puke - and I’m literally a big ass corpse.

“Alright…” I muttered, motioning for him to continue. By this point I did sit down in the chair I was offered earlier, partly because I was reeling from everyone laughing at something so completely unfunny and humorless like they were watching god damn Laurel & Hardy or whatever is popular at this time, but also because I knew it would confuse Angelo why I would take the seat now after refusing it a moment ago.

“Yes, well…” he straightened his tie slightly in annoyance. Got him. “We believe that the employees are working together to defund our operation. Possibly under the orders of a rival family - possibly The Ragu Family or The Papa John’s Syndicate.”

“I heard that that shit was run by a Vampire!” one of the guards piped up, and another elbowed him in the side. Angelo shot daggers at him and he slunk back against the wall, muttering mostly to himself, “He said the day of reckoning was coming…”

“The employees, “Angelo continued, “seem to be using a purpose-made exit somewhere in the building that they made themselves. We don’t know how, that’s why we’ve brought you in. We want you to find how and where they’re smuggling out the casino winnings so that we can put an end to it.”

“Seventy-five dollars a day plus expenses.” I rattled off from memory, my standard rate, and stood back up, dusting off my beat-up old brown overcoat. “I’ll need 50 for coverage by end of day and the rest at the end of business. I assume…” I looked around the room, motioning to the gold-plated… everything that surrounded us. “You can swing that.”

Angelo looked furious at the implication but the Don waved him in and whispered the death rattle at him once more, the lackey nodding along the entire way.

“The Don says that’s acceptable. And…” he looked down at The Don who nodded back to him solemnly. He continued in a lowered voice, “...he wants you to know he thinks I’m a giant bitch too and he’s sorry for my… little dick vibes.”

The Don motioned for one of the four guards in the room and he walked over to stand beside me, his hand still on his piece, which was tucked in way too close to his other piece for my comfort. Why do people do that shit anyway? You’ll blow your dick off, kid. Just get used to the references I shouldn’t know.

“Who’s this clown?” I asked, pointing my thumb at the guard. Pro-tip if you’re trying to be an asshole like me, if you call someone a clown they’ll super not like it, ESPECIALLY if they’re not actually a clown for a living. Really rubs people the wrong way.

“I’m the top enforcer in the entire operation, you big dumb jabroni or whatever Italians say. You can call me Tony Stromboli.” He lowered his sunglasses down to look at me over them in a way that he thought seemed intimidating but really just came off as overly sexual. I wasn’t mad at it. “The boss assigned me to keep an eye on you while you investigate. Don’t want you seein’ anything you shouldn’t be seein’, capische?”

I looked down at him with a mix of pity and, not gonna lie, a little horniness, when the gilded doors to the front office flung open and a tall, narrow shouldered man pushed his way through in a hurry. Every gun in the room besides mine was on him in an instant, but he didn’t even slow down a step. They all dropped their pieces when they recognized him - I had the bead on him at the same moment. Guy looked like he’d never lifted anything heavier than his own needle dick in his entire life and had the air of a kid named Braxton or Thad - real uppercrust cuckery at it’s finest. This was The Don’s favorite son - Elbow Macaroni.

Shit, that can’t be what his real name was, can it? Uh… I think it may have been Marconi this whole time. Oh well, fuck it. We’re pretty far in at this point; it's just Macaroni now.

“FATHER! FATHER! I demand you allow me to throw my big party tomorrow night! My new girlfriend will finally be ready to come out then!” the whiny rich fucker wheezed out of his lipless mouth. He was tall and athletic but like… rowing team athletic. Ugh. (vomit sounds)

The Don whispered to Angelo once again, who stood back up and straightened his coat jacket before translating from Ancient Fuck to modern tongue once more, “Now Elbow, your father has told you several times that there will be no parties in the VIP rooms for the next few days besides his nightly orgy and standard vomitorium hours.” He cleared his throat awkwardly then, “He’s also informed me that everyone knows you’re a kissless, touchless incel virgin and have never even seen a titty. So give it up with the girlfriend from Canada business.”

“She’s from ANOTHER SCHOOL and NO ONE UNDERSTANDS ME!!” screamed the 35 year old man at his elderly father, turning and stomping out of the room. “I’LL JUST USE MY OWN MONEY TO THROW THE PARTY!”

On his tantrumy way out he passed a beautiful statuesque blonde woman who sashayed across the room and sat in The Don’s lap, giving him a kiss on the cheek. I reeled a little from the writer really straight introducing this many characters this quickly. Jesus.

She turned to me and winked, “Don’t worry, I’m just a pre-requisite for a noir story. Every one of ‘em needs to have some leggy bimbo that you think might have done the crime in it that flirts with the detective for seemingly no reason. It’s a convention of the genre but also a sexist trapping of the era in which they originated. You can continue with the story without really acknowledging me since it never turns out to be the femme fatale anyway.”

“Oh…. uh… shit, alright. I’m gonna get started.” I stuttered, genuinely fucking shocked the quality of storytelling had dipped so low just 9 episodes into this podcast, I mean this far into the reality of my situation. We’re on page 6 at this point so shit’s gotta get moving, I guess.

I left the main office and took my sweet time heading back down to the casino floor and Mr. Stromboli followed me silently the entire way. The smell of cheap cigarettes and over-priced booze clung to the air like a rotten dew. Nothing I wasn’t used to. Just as opulent as the office above, the Egyptian theme was continued throughout the casino floor - palm trees, miniature pyramids reaching high above people’s heads, dangling incense burners lighting the room, and even several sarcophagi littered around the room.

The place was filled with shifting bodies moving to and fro from table to table, machine to machine, losing their fortune and finding their vice all at the same time, but none of it seemed out of place at first glance.

That is, until I spotted one of the clerks across the floor, behind the bars exchanging chips and cash with the gamblers. A small, mousey woman with her hair in a tall bun and her cat-eye glasses dangling from her nose as she tried to keep up with the demand of money-in, chips-out. But it wasn’t just the night rush that was bothering her - she looked absolutely nerve-wracked and one edge. Didn’t strike me as normal.

I made my way to the exchange room doors and had Stromboli let me in, though he grumbled the entire way. As I stepped inside I went to introduce myself to the small woman and she let out a blood curdling scream at the sight of me. I gotta admit, I’d kinda got used to New Yorkers not noticing I’m a giant fucking monster mash with scars criss-crossing half my face and a metal bolt jutting up out of my forehead like a horn so it was kind of nostalgic to get a villager losing their absolute shit at me at first sight.

Stromboli pushed past me and clapped a black gloved hand over her mouth to stop her from screaming and put a hand on her shoulder for comfort - a double move that really seemed to cancel itself out if you ask me. She calmed enough though, and I introduced myself.

“Oh uhm… I’m Alice.” she managed to whisper out through gasping breaths.

“Alice, when do you have to take the cash back to the vaults this shift?” I asked flatly.

“Oh…. uhm… in five minutes…” she shook a little with each word, glancing back out the bars onto the casino floor with apprehension afterward.

“How would you like some bodyguards?” I smiled. She didn’t scream this time, which was sadly a win for me with women.

The path she took was serpentine, through the casino floor, back through the double doors at the far end, and down a long, drab, gray corridor. For every expense not spared on the front of the casino another budget cut was made back here it looked like. As we descended down some old rickety wooden stairs we found ourselves in a series of barely lit hallways, twisting and turning underneath the opulence above.

Eventually we stopped outside of the vault rooms, and I looked around absently as Alice walked inside to make her deposit. The vaults were at the end of a dead end, save one hallway leading off to the right and away from them, lights flickering every now and then in the distance down it.

“What’s down there?” I asked Stromboli, pointing down the dimly lit side hallway.

“Oh that’s just the sub-basement with the boilers and plumbing and stuff. Nobody ever goes down there.” he said nonchalantly, barely even paying attention.

I stood there silently for a moment, before I smooshed my hand down my face in frustration. “You think maybe the sub-basement - where nobody goes - next to the fucking vault - might be THE LITERAL FIRST PLACE you should look to see if people are smuggling your money out, you dumb fuckers?”

Stromboli stood there stewing in that for a minute before scratching the back of his head. “... I’unno maybe or somethin I’m not a detective so…”

A scream pierced the stupidity loud and clear, ringing down the hallways around us like a clarion bell. A woman’s scream! We both turned just in time to see Alice being dragged around the corner into the dim hallway toward the sub-basement, screaming with her arms flailing in the air. I craned my head as hard as I could, but couldn’t see her assailant in the dark.

The dumb fuck Stromboli and I took off at a sprint down the hall, the sound of our footfalls filling up the space and echoing around like a drumline, but it didn’t matter - we were on the move. The hallway twisted and turned around corners, the lights flickering more and more as we ran so that no matter how close we seemed to be, neither of us could really see where we were going or what was happening.

The flickering turned to pure darkness just in time for this set of stairs to come outta nowhere and trip me. I swear nobody coulda seen ‘em, trust me. I fell and Stromboli fell after me, straight down two sets of newfangled metal stairs, cracking and crunching the entire way. But something soft stopped our fall.

I fumbled around, trying to find my footing, and kept falling down into this coarse softness we’d landed on. It didn’t take me long to identify it - even a blind man knows what sand feels like. And there was an absolute ton of it. I could feel my weight causing me to sink down into it a little and the thought of dying in quicksand in a basement freaked even me out a bit and I decided enough was enough.

I retrieved my small flashlight from my overcoat pocket and flicked it on, finding a stair railing to grip onto and pull myself to my feet. Thankfully a large lightswitch was nearby and flicking it down caused a bunch of industrial lights along the walls of the sub-basement to hum to life. Less thankfully I could now see what was happening in the basement.

Sand was spread out as far as the eye could see in the gigantic concrete room, choking every piece of machinery almost to the point of malfunction, and it was deep. Half of the height of the room was taken up by it, I had to stoop a little standing up even. But halfway across the room the sand was moving, alive, and it was lifting Alice up into the air and holding her like octopus tendrils gripping a rowboat. Standing over her, shambling and desiccated, wrapped loosely in wet, bloodstained gauze and overlaid in golden vestments, was a female figure. She waved her bony hand, flesh tightened down like a vice, over Alice’s unconscious face before diving her jagged fingernails directly into her eyeballs and screeching loud enough to deafen me.

I threw my hands over my ears, but the sound pierced through them. I tried to look away but the sight before me was like nothing I’d ever witnessed before, which is saying something. Alice’s body was slowly being drained of everything inside of it - blood, organs, bone, everything was crumpling inward like a ball being deflated with a knife puncture, and the horrific corpse woman threw her head back and screeched once more, devouring everything that Alice lost.

BANG! BANG! BANG!

Bullets fired from next to me, causing me to instinctually recoil. Stromboli stood waist-deep in sand, unloading his pistol shot after shot. Each bullet pierced through the husk-like flesh of the corpse woman but she did not flinch, finishing draining Alice to an empty flailing skin suit and tossing her to the side like she was nothing. The empty, flaccid splat of the skin sickened me but I started moving across the room toward her all the same.

I leapt with all my might out of the sand, sending it spraying in every direction, drew back my fist and slammed it with every fiber of my muscle into the corpse woman’s face. I expected to splatter her skull all over the wall behind her, but I wasn’t ready for just how fast her features exploded. Sand splayed out into the air instead of bone and viscera and I sailed past the rest of her, my shoulder slamming into the wall behind. I admit I was dumbfounded when I looked back at her and saw the sand just hanging in the air like someone had stopped a movie reel.

And like someone then began to run that reel backward the sand slowly flowed through the air like water and re-formed into her jagged, deathly features, elongated and hollow. She turned her empty eye sockets towards me and from within them a hateful red dot or a pupil bore deep into my soul.

There was a moment of recognition in there as well. Like maybe she figured out I was just as dead as she was? Either way she threw her head away from me and back toward Stromboli who was struggling to shove another magazine into his automatic pistol. He drew his pistol back up and leveled it to fire at her and… a fire axe buried itself into his back. He went to scream but only blood came out, and he fell forward into the sand, which swirled like a serpent around his body and absorbed it completely.

Standing where Stomboli once stood, bloody fire axe in hand, and wide smile across his soft features was Elbow Macaroni, the Don’s spoiled rich bastard son. He lightly tossed the axe to the side, walking across the sand as if it was nothing.

“Father never did believe me that my foreign exchange girlfriend and I were going to run away together… but you see, Queen Kefari and I were meant to be. She has stolen my heart… and me? Well… I’ve stolen enough money to start our immortal empire.” He sneered, throwing his arms out theatrically.

“You stole 14 grand, you can’t start a godamn department store with that money you pathetic simping fuck!” I screamed over the sound of the shifting sand flying at me. I’m not gonna pretend like getting hit with a ton of sand doesn’t hurt like a bitch, but the stupidity I was being faced with hurt my brain a hell of a lot more.

I was dragged under, the sand forced its way into my eyes, the burning, grainy pain threatened to overwhelm me, but I landed on top of something solid down there. Solid metal. I grasped onto it and yanked up and suddenly the tension in the sand around me was gone. It wasn’t alive any longer and it wasn’t smothering me. I yanked the thing up harder and further until we crested the top of the underground desert once more and I could rub the sand out of my eyes as hard as I could manage.

Blinking through the pain and blur I could just make out what I was holding… a gigantic, ornate golden sarcophagus. It had weighed more than any normal man could have pulled from beneath the sand, but it was a snap for a brute like me. I blinked back at the Mummy, who for her part was taking a step toward me, her hand raised toward the rich zombie coffin I held aloft.

“No…! Put that down, now..!” Elbow screamed, picking the fire axe back up out of the sand and running at me full tilt. He only got a few steps before the Mummy screeched and threw her hand out to him. Sand erupted from below him and devoured him whole like the jaws of a gigantic crocodile. Then all was still for a moment.

“Look you fuckin’ old hag, either surrender yourself over or I smash your tempurpedic crypt into a billion pieces. Seems like neither of us want that to happen.”

The Mummy yanked away the linen that wrapped around her lower face, revealing her jagged-tooth maw, and let out one last screech that slowly morphed into coherent speech. “Ew you gross old homewrecker, put it down! You’re gonna crease my dad’s hieroglyphics and he’s gonna be pissed!”

“W....what?” I stammered.

“All I wanted was to be immortal, rich, and SUPER hot. That’s not even a crime! I don’t give a fuck about anyone or anything else. Just gimme my sarcophagus so I can outtie 9000. I’m goin’ to Hollywood and be the next Greta Garbo except even hotter and more fashion!” the Mummy rattled off in an accent and vernacular I’d never heard in my entire life. I assumed it had to be Egyptian.

“How about I smash the fuck out of it and then beat your skull in instead?” I yelled, placing my fist against the side of it.

“Stop you fuckin’ grody perpetrator!” she screamed, throwing her hand at me and sending another wall of sand my way.

Thankfully this time I had the sarcophagus to take the brunt of the strike, sending the wood inside the golden case splintering into a thousand pieces from the force. I could hear her screeching out on the other side of the wall, but it didn’t stop the onslaught. I had hoped that this would be her secret weakness - don’t laugh at this, a lot of these freaks have some kinda secret weakness. I heard vampires can’t even be in the same room as garlic knots. What a sad ass life.

I knew I’d better hedge my bets so I pushed through the sand as best I could, crossing to the middle of the room and feeling around as low below the surface of the stuff as I could. The Mummy turned her red-hot hateful gaze toward me and mentioned something about the walls in a mall being totally totally tall for some reason, and began to fly toward me like a damn missile.

I had a second, tops, before she was on top of me but thankfully my hand blindly grabbed what I’d been looking for beneath the sand. I yanked it up and out into the open air just in time. The fire axe Elbow had wielded earlier swung directly through her face, splitting it open into two careening waterfalls of sand, and continued further up until it embedded itself into the gigantic pipe running the length of the room straight up the middle.

Water by the ton began to gush into the room, sweeping the sand around and around in a torrent. The Mummy screeched her uneartly horrific screech once more and was swallowed into her own quicksand, the sound of her voice gurgling down under into nothingness.

For my part, I battled the torrent hard and grasped and groped against it the rest of the way across the room. I pulled myself up and out of the basement by the staircase rails and then booked it the fuck out of there as the rising water doused out the sand into a slurry which quickly raised out of the sub-basement and into the halls of the first lower level.

It’s gonna be two months before The Great Pyramid to re-open, scrubbed from top to bottom of sand slurry. Can’t imagine patrons won’t still be complaining about sand in their shoes even then.

I didn’t have any eye-witnessed to what happened in that basement so it took every explanation I had just so The Gabagool Family didn’t bury me six feet under with the fishes or whatever the fuck they were talking about. Something about new shoes I wouldn’t like, I don’t know. They found all of their missing money in Elbow Macaroni’s suite at the Casino but I didn’t get paid a dime. All that effort wasted.

So far there’s no report one way or another that says anything about a mummy being found in the basement. No idea whether she’s dead or just off to Hollywood. I suppose she couldn’t be any more murderous and evil than anyone else out there. Might be a match made in heaven, honestly.

There’s probably a lesson about devoting yourself to the wrong person or throwing your life away for an unjust cause in here but I’m fucking done with the whole thing. The moral of the story is get paid up front.

The End.
