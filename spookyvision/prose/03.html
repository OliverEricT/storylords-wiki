A Leg Up for Christmas

A Hallmark Original Movie

Prompt: Chainsaws & Amputations

by Jeff Pennington

The small town of Whitesville was populated entirely by hard-working everyday folk who loved nothing more than Jesus, America, and Christmas, so it was happenstance indeed when a hardworking businesswoman from the big soulless city with no time for love found herself visiting one beautiful December morning.

Anita Strongman was a woman of the city through and through, soulless and hedonistic without the love of Christ, surrounded by the worst humanity has to offer, just like every city - murderers, rapists, thieves, and the worst of them all -athiests.

Thankfully, Anita's grandfather had left her his spacious four bedroom, six bathroom home in Whitesville in his will. It was worth well over a million dollars and he had purchased it for like twelve bucks and twenty minutes alone with his wife - which was the way business was conducted back in the good old days. Days when the world made sense.

That's the only reason she had left Conglomeration Corporation Incorporated Corp. in the big city at all. Now she found herself freezing standing at the edge of her wide spacious boomer-stolen property. Anita is played by Melissa Joan Hart or one of the Sister Sister twins, whoever is more hard up for money at this point. Aaaaanyway

She waited impatiently, stomping around in the slushy brown mixture of dirt and snow that accumulates for six months out of the year in hellhole suburbs I mean peaceful small towns. Eventually, a pickup truck pulled into the driveway nearby with ladder on the back of it, so you know this was a real man inside. And boy was it! A tall, swarthy man stepped from the driver's side door - but don't worry - he's white. He was wearing a turtleneck sweater and pristine high- waisted jeans even though he was holding a chainsaw and driving around in a maintenance truck because he's too handsome and well manicured for any other outfit.

Anita huffed angrily "Where have you been? I called you over an hour ago!"

The man smiled and his radiant, almost inhumanly white teeth sparkled in the morning sun. "Sorry, ma'am, I saw a little girl with a busted bike tire and fixed it up for her on the way. Made me a little late. But it was very Christ-like"

Anita grimaced but when she turned away she looked smitten in that way that only extremely melodramatic hammy actors ever think is natural. She turned back, "I'm Ms. Strongman and I'm from the big lonesome city where I normally do business and nothing but business. I'm much too busy to be supervising the cutting down of a stupid tree all day!"

The man frowned, again, hammily, shaking his head slightly. "Sorry again, Ms. Strongman. My name's Neiman, by the way. Neiman Marcus." He held out a firm, but moisturized hand for her to shake, smiling in a way that outside of this film would immediately come off as assaulty but we find enticing. He's a much younger male actor with black hair and George Michael 5 o'clock shadow. Stop writing that down, this is casting direction. No, now delete it. Backspace. Alright, keep going.

She looked at his hand like he was a diseased dog because all big city people are cockroaches, before finally taking it and shaking it awkwardly. "It's nice to meet you... could you cut this tree down now so I can leave this podunk town and get back to CIVILIZATION?" she forced the syllables out of her mouth with the last word to show you she's a bitch.

"Well sure but... you know this is the town kids' favorite Christmas Tree, right? They all gather up here every year and decorate whatever branches they can reach and sing Christmas Carols together. Not the secular garbage they play on satan worshiper radio - but the real Christ-loving songs of the past. Back when the world made sense."

"I couldn't give a fuck less, sir, please chainsaw this tree to hell so I can get the shit out of here and away from all your stupid ass christ cult Christmas horse shit, please." she spat out of her whore's mouth at poor undeserving Neiman.

He looked at her long and hard. She was pretty, there was no doubt, and that's all he really cared about. Women aren't real people with real goals after all, so he'll just change her entire personality by marrying her. That's it, he thought, he'd marry her and she'll birth away all of her secular demons!

"....why are you staring at me and mouthing "Our god is an awesome god" over and over?" Anita asked.

"UH, LLLLEmme cut that tree down for you!" Marcus said as he revved up the chainsaw he'd been carrying this entire time but if you were paying attention had disappeared during their entire conversation. Whoopsie continuity error.

"Wait, let me get back!" Anita yelled over the sound of the chainsaw this Christofascist lunatic was operating without any sort of safety equipment whatsoever. She tried to turn but the ground came up at her and slammed into her instantly the moment she moved.

"Oh god!" Neiman screamed over the sounds of the chainsaw dying down. He rushed over to Anita and rolled her over, picking her upper body up and bracing it against his own well-toned frame - but not too muscley, mom's can't fingerblast to THAT.

Neiman was repeating something about Jesus healing over and over as she slowly looked down at the site of a sudden cold numbness she couldn't identify. Her leg. Or rather, the bloody stump where her leg once lived. The chainsaw had slid off the surface of the icy tree and ripped viciously right through her flesh and bone right below the knee, severing it completely. Whoopsie again!

The world began to whirl faster than anything she had ever felt before and then all went black for Anita Strongman.

Much later, though she couldn't figure out exactly how long, she blinked through the darkness, through the bleariness, and back into reality. The rhythmic beep of a heart monitor ushering back into consciousness. She sat up slightly in her hospital bed, feeling the sheets and her patients gown shifting beneath her... except in one spot. She moved to sit up fully and pull back the sheet, but something held her in place like she was tethered by her other hand. She turned

"You gave everybody quite the scare!" Neiman Marcus said with a comforting, but rugged and commercial non-threatening smile, his hand grasping onto Anita's comfortingly. For some reason he was wearing a different turtle neck sweater and looked even MORE fuckable. "I got you to the hospital though. If I hadn't gotten here so quick, who knows what could have happened. You could have died without me."

Anita yanked her hand out of Neiman's as hard as she could, and finally flung the sheet away from her body to reveal the bandaged stump where her right leg used to be. She turned fiery, hateful eyes back toward Neiman and through gritted, raging teeth, screamed "YOU CUT OFF MY LEG!! You... you're trying to pretend like you saved my life NOW?!"

"Now come on, Anita..." Neiman attempted like twelve separate times to take her hand again but she wildly yanked it away every single time. It would've been a funny bit if he hadn't cut her leg off earlier. "I know it's hard right now... but it's almost Christmas!"

"It's HARD?! Are you k--... Christmas? What?"

"You just need the spirit of Christmas to find your footing again! And I'm gonna help you find it!" Neiman stood up and jogged over to the door of the hospital room, swooping it open dramatically. "We're all going to!"

Dozens upon dozens of strangers poured into the room, one after another. Smiling, rosy cheeked face after face passed through the threshold and Neiman called them by name and looked back at Anita each time, as if she had any fucking clue who any of these pie-faced randos were. "Mr. Charles! Dottie the Druggist! Murph the Policeman! Old John Croppentop! Touchy Tim! Sloppy Susan the Good-Time Gal! Tiny Tim like from the Scrooge story, Even good ol' Mayor Grimple is here!"

"I don't.. I don't know any of these people...! Who ARE you?!" Anita screamed, pulling her bedsheet back up over her body and holding it just over her chin, hiding behind it as they paraded in one after another.

It was simple enough to figure out who Mayor Grimple was, since he was dressed like the little conductor man from Thomas the Tank Engine except with a giant sash that said 'MAYOR' on it in big red letters. He tipped his incredibly tall stove pipe hat and yelled over the din of the crowd - which was at least forty or fifty people deep from wall to wall at this point. "HEAR YE! HEAR YE! We the people of Whitesville, the home and heart of Ms..." he leaned over and Neiman whispered into his ear for a moment. "STRONGMAN! Ms. Strongman, bring tidings of worship and merriment to heal what ails her! LET US SING! "

The throng of people raised their hands and began to sing a dull, toneless rendition of Come All Ye Faithful, swaying in time as their voices filled the room up to bursting, along with Anita's eardrums. She flattened her palms over her ears but even with that the pain of their screeching, horrible singing was almost too much to bear.

Still, she couldn't help but notice that not one of them was even looking at her anymore, they were all swaying in time like a christian rock audience when the worst music you've ever heard in your life is playing. She seized her opportunity, snatching up a pair of candy-cane colored crutches that were leaned against her bed and hobbling through the crowd and out the door.

"W-wait, honey! I haven't proposed yet...!" Neiman screamed after her, but the din of "O come let us adore him!" for the twentieth stanza completely drowned him out.

The hallways were simple to navigate, the stairs a little harder, but the check-in desk and the front foyer of the hospital were completely empty so Anita was thanking whatever the fuck athiests thank in place of good ol TOTALLY REAL JESUS when the biting frigid cold night's air hit her skin outside. She worked the crutches as fast as she could, but she had no real practice with them and was moving fairly slowly all things considered.

It felt like a lifetime hobbling down the empty, dimly lit streets before she saw a sign for the street her grandfather's house was situation but she let out a heaving sigh of relief upon spotting it and began to push on

But over the low hum of street lights came a hum of noise she couldn't quite place. A din of sound that sounded so far away but so close.. and getting closer. She turned as much as she could on her crutches to look over her shoulder in the direction it came from but nothing could have prepared her for what she saw.

Hundreds upon hundreds of marching men, women, and children, torch illuminated and filling the street from one sidewalk to the other, shoulder to shoulder. Each one of them wore a hooded robe in red and white, holding in their hands candles, torches, staves and books. Many of them held aloft banners, flowing in the wind with esoteric symbolage upon them like Anita had never seen before, and some of them held aloft gigantic metal crosses with drapery fluttering from them over the crowd. Over the rthymic pulsing of their footsteps could be heard a single word, repeated over and over in unison, in deep throat-borne voices, inhuman in cadence and vicious in tone

"Dominus.... dominus.... Dominus..."

Anita screamed, and hobbled faster, more haphazardly, slipping and almost falling but always pushing on and on away from them, as hard as she possibly could. Her breathing was loud and rasping but the sound of their voices grew and grew behind her, bridging the gap faster than she could have expected. She screamed again, louder, begging for help on the wind, but even she couldn't hear it over the dirge following her.

She could not look back. She was swinging her crutches and her body as hard and fast as she could so there was no physical way she could back. But even if in perfect condition on her own original two feet, she could not have looked back. Fear paralyzed her mind and her impulses, pushing her burning, straining muscles even harder forward.

The cacophony of voices and steps were so loud as to be unbearable now. The hands reaching and grasping and pulling at her from a hundred directions forced one last blood curdling scream from Anita's lungs before all was quiet and dark once again.

"Who wants waffles?" Anita asked with a bright cheerful smile.

"We do, we do!" two rosy cheeked children, one boy and one girl, in their sunday best suit and dress yelled in unison, hopping up and down in their seats at the breakfast table.

"I think it's unanimous, then! Waffles it is. " Neiman Marcus said was a wry grin in Anita's direction. He was sat the head of the table in a cable knit white sweater and khakis, one arm hung over the back of his chair casually.

Anita sashayed over to him in her pleated dress and apron, her hair now up in a beehive hairdo and her face plastered with cosmetics. She laughed in an airy voice before leaning down and kissing him on the cheek. "Anything for my beautiful family!"

"Now hurry up and finish breakfast kids, we don't wanna be late for Christmas Mass, Jesus wouldn't like that!" Neiman said.

The kids wolfed down their waffles and excused themselves to finish getting ready and Anita sat down on Neiman's lap, the two of them kissing chastely and them smiling at one another.

"I can't believe that once upon a time I wanted a career and life of my own in the big godless city full of athiest scum!" Anita said, shaking her head a little. "Secretly all this time all I've ever wanted is to shit out babies for some hick in a middle of nowhere town where I have nothing of my own and no real future outside of others!" She smiled brightly.

"That's my girl!" Neiman said between kisses on Anita's cheek. "This sure is the perfect life!"

"It sure is!" Anita retorted, "Except for this darn itchy leg of mine! I'll have to talk to Dottie at the druggist about it tomorrow." She laughed, scratching at the slightly necrotic skin around the staples and sutures on her right leg, just below the knee.

"As close to perfect as we can make it then." Neiman said with a knowing smile. The kids ran back into the kitchen and latched onto both of them in big hugs, the entire family embracing at the head of the table.

"Absolutely." Anita trailed off, smiling serenely into the middle distance. Our view slowly zooms in on her face as a single tear slides down her cheek to the sound of a muffled, distant, pleading scream.

The End
