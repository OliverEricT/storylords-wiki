	Prompts: Thunderstorms & Pizza
</p>
<p>
	Greasy’s Pizzarama & Skeeball Funporium had been in business since time immemorial and had been FDA approved for at least ten years, on and off, during that time. But during the decades of service the staff had never had a party as buckfuck full stupid ass wild boys rowdy as Kelly Sue McClaren’s Sweet 15 Extravaganza!
</p>
<p>
	9th graders were swinging from the light fixtures, climbing up the splintery ass wood of the faux-Roman columns that separated the eating section from the playing section (which not a ONE of these little snot-nosed fuckers was abiding by the rules regarding btw), knocking over state-of-the-art 1980’s arcade machinery that had been left here to rot like a bunch of Philadelphians flipping a car when the Eagles win the big game, or when they lose the big game, or when a small robot dares to ask for a ride. Pizza, cheese shakers, red pepper dispensers and napkin holders were flying through the air like grenades on D-Day - slapping the walls and sliding down them quickly - I mean like, suspiciously quickly - like somebody had already lubed the walls up for just such an occasion. I can only imagine it was probably just decades of cigarette smoke and disgusting child hands though.
</p>
<p>
	The ear-splitting screaming and laughter filled the place near to bursting and the person having the worst time of them all would HAVE to be Greasy himself. A pimply-faced, pie-eyed teenager who had never felt even a single tit stuffed inside of a massive rat mascot costume complete with pizza-shaped beret and ‘That’s amore!” kitchen apron. This kid was doing his damndest to try to calm the pizza riot down and was getting a seemingly endless amount of nutshots for his trouble. He would find out later that he could never have children. He will never be happier in his entire life than when he gets this diagnosis.
</p>
<p>
	But the runners-up for people having the worst time would be none other than Peggy Rickenbocker and Kristiana Blackheart Malaria Bloodwraith, a duo of amateur paranormal sleuths collectively known as The Candle Cousins! We’ve met them before - one bright, bubbly, and naive beyond all basic comprehension, that’s Peggy. And the other, a blatant poser who wants to be seen as dark, mysterious, and gother than goth, that’s Kris.
</p>
<p>
	They were seated in the back corner of the restaurant, in a booth of their own, with a small cardboard sign on the end of it which read “Loser’s Table.” Peggy let out a small sign, staring out the window into the pouring rain. Kris sat slumped in her seat with her arms crossed, glaring down at the empty plate covered in pizza crusts in front of her.
</p>
<p>
	“Why did you even agree to come to this bobo-ass clown-shoes anusfest and drag me along anyway?” Kris finally spit out, breaking the silence.
</p>
<p>
	Peggy looked back from the window and offered a wide, fake smile in return, her braces lined with different colors because I dunno if you know this shit - they ask you if you wanna decorate them when you get them. Like yeah, let’s draw more attention to this shit, great idea, doc. Why don’t we save $50 and a bunch of effort and you can just dump me into the trash can behind the school gym yourself? Anyway, Peggy offered a response after a moment, “I’m sorry Kris, I really thought that Kelly-Sue and I were friends! She’s in all the same classes as me and even gave me a cute nickname at school.”
</p>
<p>
	Kris picked up the cardboard name plate on their table and pointed to the sharpie lettering on it, “Was it “Loser’ by any chance? Cause I think we’ve got that part of the story covered.”
</p>
<p>
	“No silly! I’m not that blind to when I’m being insulted! She gave me the nickname “Mrs. Dildo” on account of how I’m gonna grow up and get married to a Dildo. She explained to me that Dildo is the name of a really beautiful rich family so it was a super nice compliment! All the kids at school call me Mrs. Dildo!” Peggy retorted, trying her hardest not to get her soda’s straw stuck between her braces as she sipped on it, blissfully.
</p>
<p>
	“....that’s… you aren’t…” Kris started but stopped, rubbing at the bridge of her nose. “THAT’S NOT…. YOU DUMB FUCKING…” she started again but then slapped the table roughly and picked up a piece of pizza crust and began gnawing on it, staring at the carnage happening in the distance silently.
</p>
<p>
	Peggy watched her reaction with increasing confusion and a growing feeling she’d done something wrong, but didn’t press it. She had something else on her mind at that moment. The pounding rain outside the window obscured most of her view this entire time but by squinting really hard into the distance she could see an old lighthouse rising into the churning stormy sky at the end of a path from the old ratty beach down behind Greasy’s.
</p>
<p>
	“Uhm… hey Kris. Can you see that out there in the distance?” Peggy finally asked, rubbing away some condensation from the window with the sleeve of her unicorn sweater.
</p>
<p>
	“The only thing I see in the distance for you is a house full of cats and a day when you ‘accidentally’ leave your car running in the garage…” Kris muttered under her breath, wiping her one dangling bang out of her eye.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, that reminds me!” Peggy leaned over the edge of her seat and reached under it, returning with a large red backpack. She spun it around to face Kris, showcasing a large, transparent plastic bubble with small holes in it and inside? An adorable, and oblivious-looking tabby cat wearing a small tag on his collar in the shape of a puzzle piece. “It’s almost time for his dinner!”
</p>
<p>
	“You brought Puzzles here?! Are you out of your smooth little brain? You don’t carry a cat around in a backpack to a Greasy’s Pizza! Don’t you know what they make the Strombolis out of here?” Kris whispered, trying to block the doors to the kitchen with her body from seeing the backpack.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh come on, that’s just an urban legend!” Peggy said, laughing as she undid the top flap of the backpack. But she paused instantly then and began to stare inside, mouth agape.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh god did he shit? Please don’t tell me he shit, I swear to god Peggy I’ll drown you in the marinara and sell the cat to the virgin in the rat costume..” Kris gagged, holding her hand over her mouth.
</p>
<p>
	“No…” Peggy said distantly, reaching into the backpack and retrieving what was inside. The familiar sight of the candle their grandmother had given them wasn’t what had set her on edge. It was the fact that it was alight, glowing with a flickering green flame that put forth no heat. A guiding flame, meant to aid them in their call. “There’s a restless spirit nearby…”
</p>
<p>
	Kris lit up as well for a moment, leaning forward and gripping the table with both hands. “Oh thank fuck, we can ditch these morons and have an excuse!” She then caught herself, and flopped back into the seat and crossed her arms, her normal bleak expression returning. “..or whatever, I don’t really give a fuck and I never have. And this isn’t one of those cutesy little ‘oh I don’t care’ things stories do all the time, I actually don’t care. And also it isn’t an attempt to try to cover up the fact I care by trying too hard to show I don’t care because that’s–”
</p>
<p>
	Peggy had already put the backpack back on, stood up, and was running across the room toward the coat room next to the front entrance by the time Kris noticed and stopped rambling angrily. She grunted in frustration and followed her, the both of them dodging between the warzone happening in Greasy’s at that moment.
</p>
<p>
	It was hard to tell but it looked like the cheerleaders had taken the cash registers and prize carousel as their base now and had fortified it with several menu signs from around the restaurant like a post-apocalyptic bunker. The softball team was behind the dividing wall between the arcade and the seating, lobbing bottles of mustard with the caps off over the cheerleader’s encampment like molotov cocktails and doing run-bys by swinging opened grated parmesan containers at the weak points in their defenses. It was a bleak day in Greasy’s but it looks like chemical warfare was on the menu now.
</p>
<p>
	As they passed the front counter, Kris caught sight of a large, gold-framed photo behind it. A large group of smiling Italian-Americans stand in front of this very building in black and white, but the front sign doesn’t say Greasy’s, it instead says Bernardi Brothers Pizzeria. A small gold plaque at the bottom dedicates the business to Marco and Matteo Bernardi, who died the week before it opened its doors. She took deep note of this, as it was especially sad, and that would make some fucking wicked lyrics for the band she’s going to start one day. It’ll be called Deathbloom. Or maybe Casketheart.
</p>
<p>
	—-------------------------
</p>
<p>
	The storm buffeted the craggy, weed-covered beach into a soggy, misshapen mess, but it only served to slow down the two in their newfound quest. Peggy stood on top of an outcropping of rocks which were being assailed by rough waters, chopped up and screwed like a Mike Jones classic by the weather. She was now dressed very much like that little bitch from the epson salt containers (she knows what she did), with a yellow raincoat and hat and a pair of pin galoshes. She held the candle up in the air and its flame flickered completely unmoved by the strong winds of the storm exclusively in the direction of the lighthouse down the coast. She waved on Kris and hopped down from the rock onto the beach, taking off at a sprint through the rain.
</p>
<p>
	Kris for her part was wearing a gigantic oversized black parka with dyed red faux-fur inside the hood which was drawn tightly to her face, a perpetual gnashed teeth, squinty-eyed scowl plastered onto her face - which coincidentally was dripping with white and black goopy pancaked makeup from the storm. She screamed something at Peggy but it was inaudible over the crashing waves and rain.
</p>
<p>
	Peggy was pretty thankful about that.
</p>
<p>
	The two of them stopped during their sojourn only once, being blown around like that one super beautiful grocery bag in American Splendor but far less magical and far more shitty and soaked. But that wasn’t why they had stopped. Out on the rollicking waves of the ocean, for only a split second, both of them caught sight of a small fishing ship being tossed about, it’s lights flashing an unearthly green, before disappearing amongst the rolling waves.
</p>
<p>
	Peggy and Kris exchanged worried glances, but turned their eyes back to the lighthouse, rushing even faster against the elements now. For his part, Puzzles took a short nap in his little backpack bubble, debating on actually shitting in the backpack later. Life was full of options for good ol’ Puzzles!
</p>
<p>
	From a distance the lighthouse had loomed large and imposing in the crashing storm, backlit by the occasional crack of lightning that split the night’s sky and laid the land threadbare and visible for but a moment. Up close, it was dilapidated far beyond the point of condemnation. The front doors barely existed any longer, dangling off their old rusted hinges, with enough room splayed between them for a full grown man to duck through. Peggy and Kris were half the height and barely had to duck to make their way inside.
</p>
<p>
	What greeted them inside was a little more out of their wheelhouse than old dilapidated buildings. The two of them slowly walked a circuit around the old crusted-over bottom floor of the lighthouse, each one of them laying eyes on new evidence to an inescapable truth. Faded, torn, worn, and forgotten police tape was flung and strung about the place like confetti, with the layout of where things had been marked off in chalk far too long enough to recognize was left discolored wood and a lack of growing moss. This had been a crime scene once upon a time.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh my golly…” Peggy said, kneeling down and placing the still-flickering green candle on the floor at her side. She started moving the detritus that was strewn about that place, trying to find any more clues for an investigation.
</p>
<p>
	“Could you please stop saying golly, gosh, and gee willickers? You’re embarrassing the holy shit out me.” Kris snorted, drawing down her hood and shaking out her extremely dry early 2000’s dyed black hair. You know how it looked back then - straw-esque. All the rage. “Say like… OH SHIT! Or… like… HOLY FUCK! …or even like.. OH MY TITTY BALLS! Literally ANYthing, cool, I’m straight up begging you.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh my gosh Kris, you’re gonna have to say SO many hail mary’s when we get home or you’re gonna go straight to… you know! H -E - Double Luigi!” Peggy hissed out, clutching at her non-existent pearls and grasping the clasps of her raincoat instead. “I’m gonna have to go to confession just for bringing up the unholy Mario Brother!”
</p>
<p>
	Their grandmothers candle, steadily flickering in the dark, raged to life interrupted them. Bright, clear, and tall - the candle flashed brightly and illuminated the entire room around them all at once - causing both girls' heads to snap in its direction. Standing astride it, hands gripped tightly around a long, slender, rusted old harpoon, was a tall, gaunt, hollow-eyed man, his jaw twisted and dangling from his skull and his body contorted and beaten into an inhuman shape. It tilted its bloated, water-logged face down at the two girls and a liquid began to pour from inside of it’s gaping mouth, pooling on the floor between his feet as a shrill, gurgling scream escaped his lips, loud, violent, and audible, “LEEEAAVVEE!!”
</p>
<p>
	Peggy and Kris screamed as loud and as clear as either was capable, but did not freeze, both of them taking a dive away as fast as they could, slamming knees down on the jagged wood floor and stumbling up to their feet enough to scramble to the other side of the destroyed old first floor of the lighthouse. They pressed their backs to the wall, shoulder to shoulder, and desperately turned their eyes to the door they had come in… which was on the other side of the horrific ghoul that stood before them.
</p>
<p>
	“OH GOD…!” Peggy screamed out, pressing herself tighter into Kris’ shoulder, her hands gripping into the fabric of her cousin’s oversized jacket. “He’s got the candle…!”
</p>
<p>
	“Jesus fuck, why does the god damn CANDLE matter right now?!” Kris screamed back, her whole body trembling in wave after wave of shock at the sight of the shambling corpse in the pallid green light.
</p>
<p>
	“LEAVE THIS PLACE! I MUST… I MUST TURN THE LIGHT…! I MUST…!” The horrific presence gurgled his words out, snatching the candle up from the floor and holding it up above his head. He tilted his head back, dark, murky liquid gushing out of his open distended jaw over his whole face and body as he looked up the lighthouse stairs. There was a franticness to his voice, a genuine fear in it, that even the inhuman, disgusting gurgling in his throat could not hide.
</p>
<p>
	“I..I know…!” Peggy yelled out, swinging her backpack off her shoulder onto the floor and opening up the top flap of it. She tilted the opening forward toward the horrific apparition and called out clear and loud, “PUZZLES, GET HIM! GET THE CANDLE!”
</p>
<p>
	Kris watched on in disbelief at what was happening far more than fear as Puzzles the Cat leapt out of the backpack and stood stock still between the two girls and the leaking corpse that stood against them. Peggy watched on expectantly as Puzzles stood there taking in his surroundings for a moment, before laying eyes on the prize before him - the hideous ghoul and the family’s candle still burning a steady green glow.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, after what felt like a lifetime…Puzzles arched his back, hissed loudly at the creature, and then ran full speed directly out the front doors of the lighthouse, disappearing into the rain.
</p>
<p>
	“PUZZLES!!” Peggy yelled after him, falling to her knees and clutching at the backpack in anguish at her failed genius plan and now completely lost cat.
</p>
<p>
	Kris wasn’t even fucking scared anymore. She was so fucking mad at how stupid what just happened was that she couldn’t even be scared ever again, she decided. She picked up a fallen brick from the floor and hefted it as hard as she could at the drowned corpse's head, the stone hitting flesh and bone with a sickening and violent thud that sent him backwards onto the floor with a single strike.
</p>
<p>
	The candle clattered onto the floor and Kris grabbed Peggy by the back of her raincoat and yanked her as hard as she could toward the candle in the middle of the room. For her part, Peggy stumbled, frantically propelled herself with her hands and feet against the old sodden floor, and managed to JUST snatch the candle up from the floor before the corpse could regain a position to snatch it back himself.
</p>
<p>
	Kris ran over as fast as she could manage in her black platform pleather boots with dangling chains, the perfect outfit for a thunderstorm mind, you, and helped Peggy back up to her feet completely, the two of them taking off at a sprint in the only direction that was available to them… up. They took the steps two-by-two going up, trying their damndest not to trip over one another as they went.
</p>
<p>
	“Why do they… always chase us… up stairs..?!” Kris screamed out to the heavens even more than Peggy, struggling to make the trip up the stairs as goths aren’t supposed to be athletic so she was always actively inactive as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
	But before Zeus or whoever God is in this setting could answer, the wood of the stairs beneath them began to warp and twist under their weight, causing a chain reaction which started the entire wooden infrastructure of the stairs inside the lighthouse to come crashing down under them.
</p>
<p>
	Both girls screamed their lungs out but continued running, the structure dropping the stairs behind them first, each step that falls dropping just a step behind where they would next reach - constantly chasing them up the entire twisting lighthouse. It couldn’t have been more than a minute of running, screaming, the entire world below them falling apart, but to them it felt like an eternity before they crested the top of the twisting stair and threw themselves onto the floor of the tiny observation deck at the top.
</p>
<p>
	They braced themselves against each other and against the floor, waiting for it to drop… but somehow… it didn’t. Peggy raised her head first, looking around the small room with saucer-dish wide eyes, her hand clutching the candle as tightly as she possibly could. It turned out the entire observation deck was built into the stone sides of the lighthouse, that’s why it didn’t fall like the rest of the wooden structure. She signed a deep sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>
	Kris raised her head with fire burning in her eyes, snatching Peggy’s collar and holding her face close to her own, “GO…. PUZZLES?! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME, PEGGY?!”
</p>
<p>
	“We trained for weeks for that maneuver! He always attacked the laser pointer!” Peggy yelled out, cringing as far away from Kris as possible and closing her eyes tight.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m going to kill you. I’m going to throw you like an Olympic discus into the heart of the ocean and let you sink so deep that even James Cameron won’t find you!” Kris screamed, shaking Peggy by the collar the entire time, “I’m going to–”
</p>
<p>
	“Wait, look…!” Peggy grabbed the sides of Kris’ head with both hands and turned her eyes toward the biggest fixture in this tiny little room - a gigantic, broken down old halogen spotlight, tilted onto it’s side and rusted almost completely into place - the light within it shattered into a million pieces by time and probably a couple golf balls knocked into her by old rich honkeys from the driving range nearby.
</p>
<p>
	“So? It’s a big flashlight, don’t change the subject when I’m premeditating your murder, it’s rude!” Kris snapped.
</p>
<p>
	“No, silly, the ghost was talking about turning the light! He probably meant this one!” Peggy wriggled free of Kris’ grasp and walked over to the gigantic fixture in the center of the room, blowing dust off the top of it. She sized it up for a moment, gripping onto its sides and pushing as hard as she could on it. It absolutely refused to move. “Ugh.. it’s rusted solid. That’s not happen…”
</p>
<p>
	“Ghost? It was definitely a zombie, you dipshit. Didn’t you even look at it?” Kris said, shaking her head in disappointment. “Zombies? You know, like from the movies and downstairs? They shuffle around and whatnot? Besides if it was a ghost the stairs falling would have stopped it from–”
</p>
<p>
	“LEEAAVVVEEE!!” the screaming of the now certified ghost filled the room, as both girls snapped to attention, spotting him standing at the exit onto the scaffolding that rings the top of all lighthouses, backlit by the cracking of lightning and the keening of thunder in the storm that still raged. He was even more grotesque now, his body looking as if it had been found rotting underwater after years and years, the thick, viscous liquid pouring from both his mouth, his eye sockets, and the wounds that proliferated his body, from blunt trauma, or simply splitting open from bloating. The thing drew back the rusted old harpoon that still rested in his hands, and aimed it directly at the girls.
</p>
<p>
	Kris screamed her lungs out, jumping back and away from the hideous apparition once more, but this time only finding enough room to press against the wall not even eight feet away from him. She placed her hands up in front of her face, trying desperately to find a way away from him, even if it was just visually for the moment before the kill.
</p>
<p>
	“WAIT!” Peggy yelled, putting herself between Kris and the ghoul, holding the sparking green candle up in front of her as if to ward it away from them. “I… I know what you want the candle for!”
</p>
<p>
	The thing, dripping and oozing liquid from dozens of holes, stood quieted for a moment, it’s decrepit old arms lowering the harpoon down to it’s side as if awaiting her next words, or judging her carefully.
</p>
<p>
	It’s…” Peggy began, Kris still screaming up until this moment. Peggy kind of exhasperatedly looked back at her then, and then pressed the heel of her boot real quick into Kris’ causing her to stop screaming and drop her hands, confusion drawn all over her face like cheap ass CVS makeup usually was. Peggy continued, “It’s… to signal the ship out in the storm, isn’t it? That’s why you’re still here!”
</p>
<p>
	The horrific thing before them didn’t move, standing stock still with both hands wrapped around the heft of the harpoon, motionless.
</p>
<p>
	“You were supposed to signal the ship but… the light wouldn’t turn. So when the ship crashed… you…” she turned her eyes to the railing he stood in front of, motioning to it with the candle for a moment.
</p>
<p>
	The corpse stood motionless still.
</p>
<p>
	Peggy looked at the candle her grandma had given her. Her grandma had told her a very important lesson when she had passed this family heirloom to her and Kris, one that Peggy would take to her very grave. “If you have beans with dinner, don’t also have cheese, you’ll never leave the toilet again after that mixture hits your lower intestine.” She’d also told the both of them that it was their responsibility to safeguard it, and Peggy took that very seriously. More seriously than anyone.
</p>
<p>
	But still, she reached her hand out toward the hideous creature before her, unshakingly offering the candle holder to it. The thing hesitated but for a moment, and then reached its hand out just as slowly as it had been offered, and took it by it’s oblong side, slipping it out of Peggy’s hand and turning it before the space where it’s eyes had once been. The liquid within them slowly began to wane and then stop, and so did the deluge that had poured from its hanging, sloughing jaw this entire time. It was as if the candle itself calmed the savageness that was there before.
</p>
<p>
	Slowly, methodically, like a clay sculpture being made on a maquette, the skin and muscle began to spread back across his features as he turned and walked the very few steps to the edge of the scaffolding that ringed the outside of the lighthouse top. By the time he raised the candle aloft in the air, not only had his features softened to true humanity, but his eyes had returned, cool, and dark, and brown. For it’s part, the candle began to glow like a magnificent beacon in the air above, shining clarion clear through the rain, the fog, the haze and the storm like a sharp blade slicing through a pizza if you forgot that was a prompt.
</p>
<p>
	The light illuminated the path through the crashing high waves of the choppy sea below for them to see a ship bouncing along the waves, the same one they had glimpsed earlier, but instead of disappearing from sight like before, it instead turned hard starboard toward the unearthly glow atop the lighthouse. The boat sailed hard onward, but the path was clear, and there were no more rocks for them to be dashed upon as they had been a million times before.
</p>
<p>
	The man who was once a ghost zombie of some sort turned back to them and smiled a serene smile. He was a rugged sort, but handsome, with a large mustache and a tall, parted and pomaded hairstyle, with a bright white smile that pierced even the darkness around them. He held out the candle to Peggy and she took it gingerly from him, smiling in return to him.
</p>
<p>
	Kris walked up to Peggy and placed her hand on her shoulder, having been watching all of this with complete awe on her face, and still dumbstruck at what was happening.
</p>
<p>
	The man nodded to them, and turned, and it was as if the radiance of his newly returned humanity blinded everything around them into pure white.
</p>
<p>
	—------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	Peggy and Kris’ eyes took a long time to adjust to the light and the darkness that followed but they were surprised to find themselves returned to the bottom of the lighthouse spiral staircase - which was returned completely to normal as it had been when they arrived. No… it was much less dilapidated, much less harmed by the ravages of time. But even more jarring, all of the evidence that there was once a crime here at this old lighthouse by the sea… was gone. No police tape, no leftover chalk, no signs of a botched and/or half-assed investigation by a group of corrupt leeches on society that offer no service and demand the ability to kill on a whim. No, the cops had never been here, would one think.
</p>
<p>
	“What the dink just happened?” Kris said, rubbing at her eyes. “How did you know ol’ bloaty needed the candle to begin with? Who are you, fucking Girl Columbo? GIRLUMBO?”
</p>
<p>
	“I used the power of DEDUCTIVE REASONING!” Peggy shouted, posing with two peace signs straight out at Kris and smiling with a beaming metal grin. She of course dropped the candle when she did this and scrambled to pick it back up. As always in these instances, it had gone out the moment there wasn’t anything freaky deaky or dead nearby.
</p>
<p>
	“I could still drown you…” Kris warned.
</p>
<p>
	“Let’s just go back and have some celebration pizza instead.” Peggy said, wrapping an arm around Kris and leading toward the door. “We gotta go find Puzzles anyway!”
</p>
<p>
	“I STILL CAN’T FUCKING BELIEVE YOU–”
</p>
<p>
	The sound of rain and thunder masked the incredulousness that Kris spewed the entire way back to Greasy’s Pizzarama and Skeeball Funporium, so I’ll save you the screaming and the name calling and everything for next time. Gotta leave something to the imagination.
</p>
<p>
	But when the two of them walked back into Greasy’s, Kris couldn’t help but notice the photograph behind the counter of the founders of the place. The small gold plaque at the bottom was completely gone, and two new faces were front and center alongside everyone who had been there before. She instantly recognized the handsome man with the dark brown eyes and mustache they had seen at the lighthouse, with a bright smile that could light a room, even in black and white, standing at the center. Standing next to him, wearing a boat captain's hat, and holding a large fish up for the camera, was a man who looked very much like him, smiling just as widely and brightly.
</p>
<p>
	There was a small bit of writing at the bottom right of the photo she could barely make out, but squinting aided her. It read, “Through the storm, together again, to many many years of pizzas and family - The Bernardi Brothers.”
</p>
<p>
	The End
</p>
<p>
	P.S. Puzzles the Cat was found by the chef at Greasy’s Pizza about twenty minutes after he’d run from the lighthouse. He was renamed Cheesy and has lived there ever since. Turns out the secret ingredient in the stromboli? It’s just people.
</p>
