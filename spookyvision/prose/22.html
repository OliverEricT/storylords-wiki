</p>
<p>
	New York, New York, Fall 1934. Entry 7.
</p>
<p>
	The air smelled like six day old asparagus piss your mom had forgotten to wipe up after your Uncle Dave visited last Tuesday and they had their usual “wrestling night” in the basement while your Dad was at golf with the boys - and it didn’t seem like it was ever any fresher in there.
</p>
<p>
	I crept behind some crusty old shipping crates as low as I could go given my girth and width, ladies, but the place looked like it hadn’t been in operation in ten years, easy. I was careful not to touch anything, even though half my fingerprints belonged to some drunk bum named Ted and the other half were from assorted day-laborers who had tried to unionize. Some things never change, I guess.
</p>
<p>
	I had been called to investigate this old, seemingly abandoned warehouse at the edge of town by a mysterious benefactor who had been mailing me checks for about a week before he’d even rang me up about the job. I’m not the most trusting guy in the world, but I hadn’t paid rent in two months and hadn’t had a hot dog in four so I had big money moves to make with those payments that couldn’t wait for better sense to kick in.
</p>
<p>
	The guy on the phone, who sounded like Jethro Clampett had fucked his cousin and the kid went to the Emily Post Etiqeutte Academy from birth, had told me that some documents had made their way to this warehouse - which was supposedly a front for illegal shipping of stolen goods. From a cursory glance around the place the only thing this warehouse had been used for in the past decade was a public toilet.
</p>
<p>
	Still, I was always one to do my due diligence. It only took me a couple seconds to pick the lock on the decrepit manager’s office door at the back of the building. It was up a flight of sodden wooden stairs that I was certain would give way under me like your mom’s ass gave way to my behemoth stiched-up donger last night when we re-enacted Thriller buck-ass naked in your childhood bed. How’s that for living up to the rest of the show’s humor, you fucks? Aaaannnyway…
</p>
<p>
	I turned my flashlight to the desk that was turned over on its side against the back wall inside the office. It looked almost like someone had thrown it over to use it for cover, but there wasn’t a bullet hole to be found anywhere on it. However there was a big chunk of the left side of it completely missing, splintered from the wood almost like it had been ripped away somehow. I ran my fingers over it and came back with a strange, powdery black substance. Rubbing my fingers together, it fell off easily, but didn’t leave behind any residue like soot would.
</p>
<p>
	I shrugged, and got to work, figuring whatever the fuck that was wasn’t any of my business unless I was getting paid for it. The desk drawers were all still locked but I just yanked them out whole, splintering the wood on either side of them outward with each yank. Papers and file folders were strewn all along the inside all willy-nilly, no sense of order or arrangements like you would expect from office records. There was also a small gun and a bottle of extremely cheap gin in there but a 9-to-5 office worker worked here so that made perfect sense. No further investigation required there, am I right? Fuck.
</p>
<p>
	Each one of the folders was labeled with the same small logo on the top flap - The Dusk Corporation. Stranger still, not one of them had any other distinguishing feature on them. No account names, no expense titles, no client first name, last name, absolutely zilch to determine what the fuck they were.
</p>
<p>
	I picked one of them at random from the pile inside the drawer and flipped it open. There was a shipping manifest inside that was attributed to a Mr. Adrian Deville of The Dusk Corporation. Two thousand pounds of…. Something. Ten items, each one just a series of numbers, shipping out to different locations. It didn’t take a mathematician to do the simple division of numbers - that was pretty much the perfect weight for ten corpses. I was confident in making such a wild swing thanks to the fact that none of them had any further identification. Not to mention that everything I ever get involved in has some kinda corpse shit going on with it. You can set your watch by that shit.
</p>
<p>
	There was a small note in the bottom, hand-written in the chicken scratch of the working man - far more legible than a doctor’s prescription but still pretty messy. Thankfully only one of these things needs to be legible or you’ll fucking die painfully from taking the wrong medicine, am I right? The note read, “Do not touch the purple liquid coming out of them. It will change you.”
</p>
<p>
	I ruminated on what the fucking shit that could possibly mean as I flipped open another folder. It looked like the shipping addresses associated with the ten shipments. A quick glance confirmed the numbers lined up. Looked like there was one headed to a place called Whitesville in Connecticut. Another going to some backwater nowhere in West Virginia called Huntington. Several were being sent to a desert location in Nevada called Cirron. The bulk of the items were being shipped IN from other locations though - all heading to a corporate location in the middle of the city - The Dusk Corporation headquarters.
</p>
<p>
	I was just about to flip open another folder when I heard the light groaning sound of the door across the room behind me swinging on its ancient rusted hinges. I flung around, wrenching the 357 out of my shoulder holster tucked beneath my overcoat as fast as I could, but I met the cold steel end of another gun’s barrel pointed at me before I had cleared leather. I slowly lurched the gun back into the holster as I accepted it wasn’t gonna get out before I got shot.
</p>
<p>
	“You’re very, very late.” the voice behind the gun slithered through the air like the burning smoke from the end of a cigarillo. Snaking and twisting like a predator coiled in the weeds. The room was dark, but even in the haze of inky blackness I could see her clear as day. My breath was knocked out of me just by the sight of her, leaving me gasping for it back.
</p>
<p>
	She was tall, taller than any woman I’d ever seen before, easily over 6 feet but that didn’t even register to me before the ice cold blue of her eyes pierced into my very soul. The frigidness within them was painful, filled with a resentment that was all-too familiar to me. She wore a wide-brimmed hat pulled down low, with pitch-black hair tucked back into a low bun that was scorched across with one long, jagged white line that shot through - just like my own hair.
</p>
<p>
	But the similarities didn’t end there… oh no. Not by a long shot. Her snow-white skin, where it could be seen at the ankles, the wrists, the neck - just small pops beneath the long, tied closed trenchcoat and black skirt she wore tightly tied to her form - there were a criss-cross of ragged black stitches.
</p>
<p>
	This woman… it struck to the very soul of me to look upon her. The moonlight which streamed in through the crooked age-destroyed blinds over the window showcased it too plainly for me to ever deny, though I denied it to the core of me still …. There in this rotten, decayed nowhere stood an impossible being, the only other one on the face of this cruel, hateful world that had spurned me since my unfortunate birth - another thing like me.
</p>
<p>
	“You seem shocked to see me, Adam… do you not remember?” The woman’s smoky, rueful tones filled the room with an acid that burned away at me, but she kept her trigger finger steady on the Thompson Submachine gun in her gloved hands just the same as if I wasn’t melting away inside.
</p>
<p>
	“You’re…” I stumbled on my words, a rare thing for me.
</p>
<p>
	“Your bride.” She snapped, finishing my sentence for me venomously. She took a step forward, her black lips sneering a bitter smile at me. “The bride you left to burn in Victor Frankenstein’s makeshift laboratory… You can call me Eve. It only seems fitting.”
</p>
<p>
	“No..! No, I saw him rip your body apart before he ever conducted the procedure to breathe life into it!” I snapped back, suddenly filled with a rage I hadn’t felt since my revenge against Victor a lifetime ago. My fingers clenched so hard into fists that the slow-running dark blood beneath my skin began to drip out where my fingernails dug in. “You’re a liar! A fake..an apparition sent to torture me!”
</p>
<p>
	“SILENCE!” she screamed back at me, gripping the trigger and firing off a couple shots into the still of the night. The bullets burned hot as they pierced into my shoulder, throwing me back a step, but I was pretty undeterred. I stood straight back up and snarled in return, but she was undeterred as well, and continued on. “You were born in chemical baths and rushing water, Adam! I was born in a crucible of fire! I read everything in that book that woman wrote using the Doctor’s notes… you sought bloody revenge after Victor tore my body apart… you fled into the night, left what was left of me at his mercy…”
</p>
<p>
	She was trembling a little now, the raw emotion of it all coursing through her veins, and all the anger was drained from me as I simply began to listen.
</p>
<p>
	“But the book got one thing wrong… Victor didn’t toss my parts away into a river. He set the entire building aflame to rid himself of the abomination he sought to create for you. But the flames, they sutured the wounds he had torn, fused the stitches back into place he had stitched. The moment I awakened to the world, birthed by alchemical fire, I felt the seering, violent, burning pain of being alive, Adam. And even when it was over, the pain never truly subsided. I read in his notes about my betrothed… another horror like myself that sought comfort in this hateful world. But you weren't there… and I searched far and wide.. But you were never there.”
</p>
<p>
	“I didn’t know..! I couldn’t have..,” She cut me off my shaking the tommy gun at me again, that same hateful, rueful sneer returning to her pallid features.
</p>
<p>
	“No. You couldn’t have. You never came back. You were off murdering women and bedeviling the depraved soul that birthed us. You sunk beneath the arctic waves and I didn’t know what had become of you until a hundred years later. You had the kindness of death for a short while, Adam, but I had nothing but vicious, worthless life this entire while. I have lived every savage, cold, painful year on my own since then. Until I found a book tossed away in a storm drain… Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein. You see, I remembered the name. It stuck with me somehow even hundreds of years later. And then I knew it all… and knew I was truly abandoned. And I swore revenge, just as you had… against what had spurned me most.”
</p>
<p>
	I stood in stunned silence, and she allowed it for a moment. I summoned the courage to finally speak, and slowly began - “So uh… there’s probably no chance we could hook back up now, or…?”
</p>
<p>
	Bullets rained out like hail pattering on a window pane, ringing through the darkness in arcs meant for my heart, but I moved with surprising speed for my size, leaping over the overturned desk behind me and ducking behind its heavy wooden cover. The desk splintered with every shot, her screaming rage audible between them. I finally dug out my heavy revolver and raised it over my head, squeezing out two shots to give the impression I was firing back at her, forcing her behind cover.
</p>
<p>
	Thankfully it worked and she stepped outside the door, turning the corner to hide her body away from my line of sight. I vaulted the desk and ran for the window, leaping into it with all of my weight and shattering it into a thousand pieces. The fall would have killed any normal man but I think we’ve established I’m a real piece of shit with no redeeming qualities at this point, so I’m far from normal. Or maybe not depending on what kinda guy you know. Either way, the landing didn’t feel great. The sickening pop of my arm dislocating and a bone near my hip splintering filled my ears, along with rushing blood, as I slammed full-tilt into the concrete street outside of the warehouse.
</p>
<p>
	A car swerved at the last second, its headlights flashing over me in the night, before it veered away and narrowly missed running me over - which would have mostly been insult to injury I think. A man leaned out the window as it sped away, and screamed back at me, “WATCH WHERE YOU’RE FALLIN OUTTA WINDOWS AT YA FUCKIN FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER ASS BITCH!! FUCK YOUR MOTHER FOR ME, YA SHIT AND CUM STAINED FUCK! FUCK OFFFF!” I was left reeling against the cold concrete in a lot of pain - and honestly a lot of confusion about how his voice managed to carry that far for that long as he drove away.
</p>
<p>
	A bullet imbedded itself into the asphalt near my head and I knew it was time to fuck off like that nice driver had recommended. I put my hand to my dislocated shoulder and yanked as hard as I could to get it to relocate back to its fucking home but I failed the first time - which hurts a hell of a lot more than when you succeed if you think it looks fucked in movies when people do this. The second time it popped back into place and another bullet hit the ground in front of me, sending a spray of stone into the air.
</p>
<p>
	I was up and running pretty quickly after that. My blood was pumping in my ears loud enough I couldn’t even hear the sounds of the city around me as I sprinted across town. I didn’t even have a destination in mind at the time since I knew that Eve knew where my office was. This entire thing had been a setup to get me there, but I didn’t know WHY. I mean, I understood that Eve wanted revenge for me leaving her as a bunch of body parts for a mad scientist to burn up in a house fire -and trust me, I understood where I’d gone wrong in that relationship without a call to The Loveline this time around. I got why we had to break up and the fact there wouldn’t be an MTV’s Make Ups to follow - but why there? What did The Dusk Corporation have to do with her revenge?
</p>
<p>
	Finally, after what seemed like hours of running, I stopped to catch my breath in an alleyway somewhere in the red light district. I pressed my back against the cold stone wall and it felt great against the bullet wounds I’d mostly forgotten I had up until this point. I thought for a long time, the chill in the night air permeating my bones before I had calmed enough to finally remember.
</p>
<p>
	Mr. Deville… The Dusk Corporation. These were names I’d heard before. The boat that the fish fucker guy had been imprisoned on last month was owned by the Dusk Corporation. One of the scurvy ass pirates on board had said that they were headed to a private zoo owned by a Mr. Deville. Hell, the name Dusk Corporation had come up a few times in my investigations before I started writing them all down to keep files even. I was suddenly struck with the epiphany that all of my answers could be found in one place, and it was only twenty-eight blocks away in Midtown.
</p>
<p>
	—---------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	The dizzyingly tall black spire in the middle of the city that The Dusk Corporation’s headquarters had always struck me as a bit of an eyesore, to be honest. Ever since the Empire State Building had been completed a couple years ago every dumb rich bastard on the block had been dumping daddy’s money into building their own skyscraper to show how small their entire family lineage’s dicks are and this didn’t seem to be any different. It didn’t even reach to half the Empire State Building’s height, but it had a kind of Soviet Brutalist architectural design that screamed repressed sexuality and hidden agendas. And now, I had yanked the double doors at the front of the building off of their hinges, found the building completely empty inside, and was climbing about a hundred sets of stairs to make it up to the CEO’s office at the top floor.
</p>
<p>
	Thankfully there had been a little slat-board at the front of the building which had informed me where to find Mr. Deville’s office along with everyone else who worked there of note - a little perk you don’t normally see posted up by the entrance of most RPG final boss dungeons. Which is exactly what it felt like climbing up those stairs, heading up to a final boss.
</p>
<p>
	I pressed against the door at the top of the stairs and it swung open without any fight - a complete lack of any locking mechanism catching me completely off guard. Greeting me there was the most ostentatiously adorned waiting room I’d ever seen in my entire life - and if you look like me you get left to wait in a lot of waiting rooms for a lot of time. Everything seemed modern and tasteful but expensive beyond all reason and dotted throughout I couldn’t help but notice a bunch of antiques from my original era and before - beautiful couches and ottomans, massive portraits by renowned artists of the past, beautiful gas lamps still lit… but not a single person anywhere in sight.
</p>
<p>
	I drew my pistol and carefully trudged across the room, peering around in every direction I could to make certain no ex-fiances or fish men, or fucking zombies or whatever else were about to pop out and yell boo at me again. And to my surprise… no one did. I made it all the way across the massive room to a set of ornately decorated double doors - carved black obsidian with gold plating in places.
</p>
<p>
	It was absolutely beautiful, but upon closer inspection, the figures depicted along it all seemed to be in tortuous agony… along the bottom were figures of people raising their hands to the heaven, tears on their faces, and above them flew bat-winged humanoid figures with demonic smiles upon their faces, each wearing a crown on their head, and all of them encircling what looked like a pock-marked moon in the sky.
</p>
<p>
	I stood, transfixed, staring at it for a few minutes maybe, though it seemed like a lot less. Still, when I finally snapped back to my senses I realized how dumb it had been to just stand there gawking like a fuck that long judging the decor. What am I, the fucking Queer Eye for the Straight Guy: Breaking and Entering Edition?
</p>
<p>
	I tucked my gun back into its holster, grabbed the handles of the huge obsidian doors and swung them open. If anything had shocked me that night the most it would have been hard to beat what I saw on the other side. The lights were all on inside the office, a small record player in the corner was softly playing a concerto by Vivaldi, and seated at the far end of the room, behind a gigantic oaken desk, holding a thin-necked wine glass half-full, was what I could only assume was Mr. Adrian Deville himself.
</p>
<p>
	But what really caught me off guard, standing there with my metaphorical pants around my ankles and my metaphorical asscheeks spread, was the fact that the man behind the desk smiled at me as he sat his wine glass down on his desk. Not the smile of a nervous man, or even a friendly man, but the smile of a predator peering at his weakened prey.
</p>
<p>
	“Good evening, Mr. Frankenstein. Won’t you come in. Would you like to have a seat?” The man waved a hand through the air to beckon me to one of the heavy leather chairs placed haphazardly in front of his desk. When I didn’t move he chuckled deeply to himself, “No, I suppose you wouldn’t, would you?”
</p>
<p>
	“What the fuck is going on here?” I said with all the wit and control of the situation of a toddler on his first trip to the doctor for shots.
</p>
<p>
	“You weren’t supposed to make it out of that warehouse, I’m afraid. But you proved a little more… reckless than I’d been informed of you.” He steepled his fingers in front of his face for a moment and then started as if suddenly realizing something, “Oh, where are my manners? I didn’t even introduce myself, I have you at such a disadvantage.” He grinned with a wry superiority that instantly snapped me back to my normal bitter misanthropy.
</p>
<p>
	“You’re Adrian Deville, CEO of The Dusk Corporation, and apparent owner of a zoo with sentient beings in it.” I said matter-of-factly, hoping that I could deflate even an ounce of the smugness out of this fucker.
</p>
<p>
	“Absolutely true. A little side project of mine you needn’t worry yourself over.” Deville stood up from his seat and I finally had the presence of mind to take him in completely. He looked about middle age, with small hints of gray trailing along his temples in his jet black hair, a small goatee to match in the same salt and pepper around his perpetually smug grin - though he never seemed to show his teeth. He wore a perfectly tailored black suit, with a crimson red undershirt and a black tie - a pretty bold fashion statement in those days. The one thing that stood out the most about him were his eyes - they were constantly trained not on me specifically, but through me, like he was seeing something in me that he knew completely and it made me intensely uncomfortable in a way I don’t really remember ever feeling before. And they were a strange brown, bright and glistening, almost golden honestly. They reminded me very much of a cat's eyes for some reason, and I got the predatory sense of them immediately.
</p>
<p>
	“Still, “ he continued, turning his chair back into place facing forward with his hand and tucking his other arm behind his back in the way rich douchebags tend to do to seem more prim and proper, “You have been quite impressive in your efforts to undermine my operations. Your name continually pops up as having done some small this or that with my business that puts me behind schedule. I can’t have that. We’re running an incredibly tight schedule here. One that was put in place a decade ago and won’t come to fruition for another 90 years.”
</p>
<p>
	“Uh… what?” I genuinely asked, suddenly not following what the fuck this rich cock was saying anymore. “I’m not like… purposefully after your shit or anything. I’m just trying to make a living.”
</p>
<p>
	“A living…” Deville laughed, shaking his head. “How droll. I’m afraid that living is beyond the both of us in the classical sense, isn’t it Mr. Frankenstein?”
</p>
<p>
	“What?” I was starting to to get a little frustrated at this point. “Look, you were trying to off me because I was causing a problem with your organization - that’s not really my M.O. I work in conjunction with a lot of… let’s just call ‘em organizations, without stepping on anybody’s toes. That’s the price of being a walking bunch of corpses with no people skills and trying to run a business. Just lemme know what to avoid, and I’ll avoid it. I mean hell, I could use the business to make sure no one else gets into it either, honestly. Maybe we could work something out. I just want to know about Eve.” Yeah, yeah I gave him the pitch. I’m a businessman at heart, folks, you can’t hate the player for playing.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m afraid not. I do not suffer those who’ve crossed me. It’s a policy that has kept me alive and thriving for a very, very long time.” His lips parted into a vicious, vitriol-soaked grin that wrinkled his cheeks back away from his mouth in such an unnatural way that it would have weirded me out all on it’s own - but glinting in his mouth in the incandescent lights of the high rise office were two long, jagged ivory fangs that pressed into his lower lips even as he chuckled.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh come the fuck on, vampires are real too?! Next thing you’re gonna tell me the god damn Mole People are real! Are there tiny people living in the fucking moon, too?!” I burst out, completely incapable of hiding my incredulity. This shit keeps popping up on me, man, I just get used to one weird monster mash horse shit thing being real and then BOOM - now it’s vampires. Now it’s ghouls. Now it’s boogins. It’s something new every two weeks it seems like.
</p>
<p>
	Deville threw his head back in a full laugh this time, almost manic sounding, and placed his hand on his forehead as he did. When he finished, he shook his head, dropping his hand back to his side. “You are a very funny thing, Mr. Frankenstein. You don’t even understand that you have wandered into the spider’s nest at feeding time.”
</p>
<p>
	He walked to the window and looked up into the night’s sky. The gigantic windows filled the entire wall behind the desk, and framed the pale full moon in the sky perfectly above him. He held his hand up toward the moon in a move dramatic enough for a Cary Grant picture and then swirled his fingers in the air. “It is time…”
</p>
<p>
	And with those words spoken, from the very edges of the moon in the sky, crept inward a blindingly blood red tone that snaked like tendrils across the surface, slowly swirling inward and enveloping the pale silver of the disc to turn it into a virulent and all-encompassing red. For my part, I fucking took a step back and dropped my jaw, completely fucking floored at this magic trick - Houdini would’ve shit, honestly.
</p>
<p>
	“You see, Mr. Frankenstein… I’m not A vampire… I am THE vampire…” Deville turned and looked at me, the irises of his own eyes now the same glowing blood red of the moon in the sky, burning with a jovial murderousness that bordered on the psychopathic. He smiled a wide, predator's smile as he spoke, “I am Dracula. And through pure happenstance you are to be witness to my ascension to godhood…”
</p>
<p>
	“Not if I fucking plug you up with lead first, you prissy ass storybook freak!” I screamed as I yanked my 357 back out of its shoulder holster and got it about halfway pointed to him before I felt the familiar feeling of cold steel pressing against the back of my skull, followed by the even more familiar feeling of a gun cocking. I stopped and slid the gun out slowly. Twice in one night I couldn't get it out to use it… happens to every guy I guess.
</p>
<p>
	“I think instead you’ll give me that gun, sweetheart. I’ll not have you causing another scene tonight.” I recognized the smoke in the voice instantly. If I lived another two lifetimes I would never forget the sound of her voice. Eve. She pressed the end of her revolver into the back of my head harder, and held her hand up around my side, palm up, waiting.
</p>
<p>
	“Hello again, dear. I would’ve thought our first date would’ve put you off meeting up again so soon.” I grumbled as I turned the gun over and slapped it down into her hand. She pulled the gun back and I raised my hands into the air and huffed out my frustration.
</p>
<p>
	“You have a debt to pay to me in blood, Adam. I won’t ever be put off from that.” She walked slowly around me, never lowering her revolver she kept pointed at my midsection. Walking backwards across the room she placed my gun down on the desk in front of… fucking Dracula, I guess. It doesn’t make sense to write ‘Deville’ anymore but I’m going to, I can’t bring myself to fucking write Dracula over and over.
</p>
<p>
	Deville stared at the blood moon in the sky above him with a kind of deep satisfaction that seemed to permeate him. He stood transfixed for a moment before turning back to me and smiling, “You know, I have waited for this moment for a very, very long time. I have worked so very hard… reached my fingers out into the future of our world and set things in motion that will continue for almost another century. I have and will continue to place pawns on my chess board and move them around without anyone suspecting anything for all of this time… and tonight the fruits of my labor will first be felt…”
</p>
<p>
	“What the fuck is this guy talking about, Eve? How can you be working for this pompous fucking nut? He thinks he’s Count Dracula.” I groaned out, keeping my hands in the air above me.
</p>
<p>
	“He is Dracula, numbnuts.” Eve scoffed and pointed her gun a little harder in my direction, “I’m working for him because he promised me the chance for revenge against you. That’s literally all I care about, have you even been paying attention?”
</p>
<p>
	“Mostly.” I said half paying attention, glancing up at the blood moon in the sky. “How did you pull that trick off anyway, David Copperfield? Smoke and mirrors?” I asked, completely timeline- appropriately cause there was a book by that name, remember? It doesn’t have anything to do with magic, you say? What, you fucking read it yourself to know that? I didn’t think so. Moving on.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh it’s not a trick. It’s just the beginning… 90 years from now there will be another Blood Moon… the second in a single year. I will make certain of it. And the gate will finally be open… The thing inside will have withered, trapped between our world and the next thanks to the zealots' failed attempt at birthing it to our plane, and nothing will be blocking it any longer. The perpetual night… the endless darkness will descend upon our world. And my kind… who have clung to the shadows and starved will finally feast upon every living being in the world… for all of time.”
</p>
<p>
	Deville seemed transfixed on the sky as he spoke, but turned his gaze back to me and smiled his vicious animal smile once more.
</p>
<p>
	“Apologies, Mr. Frankenstein. It will all be explained in short time. I am responsible for the blood moon you see above - though it will be happening simultaneously at this hour 90 years from now thanks to me as well. Time is… well it’s probably too complicated for you. Just know it is taking some effort to keep the moon as it is and I may become preoccupied from time to time.”
</p>
<p>
	“Look this is all fascinating, really, but can I murder this fucking lowlife scum freak of nature ex-fiance of mine now, or fucking what?” Eve snapped, shaking the gun in her hand at me with every word to accentuate her point.
</p>
<p>
	“Harsh.” I retorted.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh not half as harsh it’s going to be before the end for you, my dear.” Eve said through gritted teeth between grinning black lips.
</p>
<p>
	“No… no I like the idea of having an audience. I always have.” Deville sneered a rueful smile, remembering something from a book I never read because it seemed a little too obvious for me to be reading it considering it’s like the other monster man book everyone talks about. That’s what I get for being a hipster I guess but you reading this probably get what he’s referencing. He continued, “We will watch the coming future together… then you may do whatever you see fit with him. I will no longer care.”
</p>

	So there I was. Between a metaphorical rock and a hard place - the rock being some kind of end of the world blood moon scenario I had no fucking clue about one way or another that god damn Dracula was putting on for some reason and the hard place being my ex I had no idea ever even existed who wanted to chop my balls off and feed ‘em to me just for starters.

	I’ve heard cliffhangers do pretty well and I’m trying to sell the rights to these journals sooner or later to get a motion picture deal goin so let’s go ahead and say this is where we’re gonna cliffhanger it. Fuckin’ deal with it if you’ve got a problem with that, we’re all tryin to make a living out here even if we’re a bunch of dead guys in a trench coat.

	The moral of the story this time? Before you take a job maybe check out the person hiring you or the company hiring you or whatever. You’re really liable to get into some real fuckin hot water if you don’t. Not saying like… Dracula and The Bride of Frankenstein tag-teaming your corpse kinda trouble, but hey, you never know. That’s just good life advice too.
