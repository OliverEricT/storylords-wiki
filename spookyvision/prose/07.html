The Silencing Song

Prompt: Premonitions & Bards

by Jeff Pennington

Old Main is the nickname amongst co-eds and officials for Marshall University's main office building where almost every resource you could think of is housed on campus. A 100 year old building, it certainly showed its age with every step against the brownish-red carpet, the floorboards underneath screeching out and whining from the pressure. The smell of a hundred years lingered amongst the hallways and every door led to a labyrinth within that only the faculty could ever hope to understand.

Fuck you if you needed a transcript or something, is my point. Idiot.

Pavlov Flinch had been wandering here from office to office since around 6am. He'd slept on a bench outside of the liberal arts building Smith Hall overnight since he'd ingeniously left the Cabell County Public Library at like 7:30 last night to seek out answers here. Wasn't the first bench he'd pissed on and wouldn't be the last. I mean slept.

Every office he'd gone to had shipped him off to another office for this form or that signature, told him they couldn't help him and to start back at reception, or outright asked him to leave. He'd been stuck in a labyrinth of red tape on top of the maze of a building - ping-ponging from floor to floor, room to room, rude ass hateful person to half-asleep hateful person - that is until they finally figured out he wasn't actually a student at Marshall so they just told him where to really go. He was there in minutes.

The records rooms and alumni directory were in the basement of the building, which had an oppressive atmosphere that most colleges would kill to hang over their students but that would usually have to wait until the first loan repayment letters were sent out. Flinch had waited for anyone to even show up to the room for around 20 minutes, but thankfully he had brought the Game Boy Advance he'd stolen from some sleeping kid on the bus last year. Little dipshit only had the Mario World remake, a pack of Mike & Ike's, and a school report card with it. That was Flinch's B honor roll now, Billy. You FUCK.

"What are you doing here?" the old woman who slid behind the record's desk said with a massive cloud of cigarette smoke hissing out of her lungs. She couldn't have been more than 5 feet tall hunched and wore those massive cat-eye frames with Transitions lenses you never saw outside of industries that didn't deal with the dead. Her stare would bore holes through him but her lenses still hadn't transitioned back and the pigpen-ass cloud around her obscured her a bit

.

Flinch glanced at the gigantic No Smoking and Burning Hazard signs plastered all over the room, but didn't care, so fuck it. "I'm here looking for someone. And I don't mean romantically, so put it back in your pants."

"Not in your wildest dreams, ya little shit stain." she spat, belching out the last two words like a 90's cool dude character in a sitcom. Or a drunk. "What's the name? Current student or alumni?"

"The name is Kayla Hunter, she would've been a student around 1999. She was a... train maker or something, I wasn't really paying attention." Flinch was barely paying attention now, side-eying the still open Game Boy Advance sitting in the seat next to him. He was on the level with the triceratopses that shot fireballs. He loved those little guys.

"....you came to the records room to look up info on a current faculty member? Did your ma swing you like a mace to keep predators out of your fucking cave, or what?" The records lady stared from behind her still-darkened lenses. How long do these things take to transition? Jesus, it's in the name of the thing!

"...what?"

"Professor Kayla Hunter is the head of the Engineering Department, you fucking thick-skulled subhuman. Her office is in the Weisberg Engineering Building, across 3rd Avenue. Now get out of my office before I rip your clothes off right now." She went from raging to seductive, waggling her grayed eyebrows at him.

Flinch clicked his teeth cockily and shot her fingerguns as he scooped up his Nintendo handheld and headed towards the door. He had almost made it round the corner into the hallway before the records lady called out after him.

"Oh, I think she's probably in Morrow Library at this point! She spends all her free time in the stacks down there!"

As Flinch creaked his way back down the hall toward the rickety ass stairs he'd fallen down here on, he mulled over those last words a few times in his head. "Down... there?"

----------------------------------------------

Morrow Library was a gigantic, old, and appointed building just around some shrubbery and steps from Old Main, barely rising over the treetops that enshrouded it on either side. The rotunda outside was almost completely empty, save a few stragglers here and there sitting with books open or standing chatting amongst one another. You could mistake the four rows of blackened, tall windows over the double door openings for being completely placid and untouched for years, save for the doors swinging open and revealing a backpack toting student exiting into the crisp fall air.

The only thing of note was a filthy hippy seated at the far edge of the rotunda on the ground, legs crossed, a guitar on his lap and an old-timey music box sitting next to him with it's lid open collection change or small bills tossed inside - mostly by those too guilty not to after making eye contact. This type of dude was literally always here and you could bet your sweet tits he was playing Wonderwall or Save Tonight and literally not a goddamn thing else.

Thankfully someone else walked out the glass doors past Flinch so he didn't have to pay up after his eyes brushed past the busker's own for four point seven seconds.

Flinch lumbered up to the door and grabbed it before it swung closed. This campus had an extremely annoying habit of making you swipe a student ID at doors to get into certain places and he didn't feel like dealing with it anymore. He wasn't gonna do anything untoward in the dorm buildings! It was offensive, an affront to his honor, and a complete coincidence it was the all-female one! Panty raids are a time honored, college tradition damnit!

Inside was more of that dank old crusty smell of age and probably black mold that had permeated most of his waking hours today. There was a small sign on the wall, made of stone, pointing past the exhibit room in the back and the rows of shelves to the sides, clean and clear as day - "The Stacks."

Good detective work so far, Flinch.

Past the sign was a small desk behind a glass window, a young man seated with his feet propped up on it, tossing a wad of paper up and down like he was shooting a basketball. He blew half-full bubbles of Hubba Bubba then clicked his teeth together to pop them as Flinch approached, not even looking down to greet him. There were a set of steps leading down past him to a large wooden door with a metal inset handle.

"Uh... I need uh... books and shit. To learn. Let me in." Flinch vamped on the spot.

"Oh uh.. " the kid looked down and finally took Flinch in, nearly doing a double take at this middle aged balding man in a trench coat and keyboard tie. "No offense but you're old as fuck dude and you don't look like you'd EVER try and better your life. You sure you're a student here?"

"No, I'm a detective. I'm here to talk to Professor Kayla Hunter about a case." Flinch fumbled about in his pockets to find his fake police ID badge, but the kid didn't even pause for a second after giving him another look up and down.

"Huntington Police Dept. spent all their money on night sticks and Waffle House again this month huh? Go on in officer, but I'm not letting another one of your pigs in here without your bacon wrappings again. You tell Police Chief Mikey to find the claim ticket for the White Way laundry and get your uniforms back or this is the last time. You got it?"

Flinch reeled for a moment at the implications of that completely non-essential infodump, and then just nodded in agreement. The police chief lost the claim ticket to the ENTIRE DEPARTMENTS uniform laundry...? Were cops even stupider than HE was now? Anyway, the kid pressed a buzzer on the wall behind the desk and an EXTREMELY loud click echoed through the room, the heavy wooden door swinging open on command.

Flinch nodded to the kid again, still a little stunned, and entered. What greeted him at the bottom of the sloping stairs was a cold, damp air - row after endless row of incredibly old metal shelving stacked unceasingly and precariously with ancient books, records, and files. The walls were a stained white stucco that had never been finished over and tainted in the decades since it's last application, but there was near no-chance to ever get to them with all the shelves. Dim, tenuous light steadily hazed the room over from free-hanging metal lamps at the low ceilings which anyone over 6 foot would be forced to hunch under, but Flinch was fine.

Every so often he passed a person looking through this book or perusing these old records, but for the most part he just pressed on. It became painfully obvious by the fourth or fifth turn around a bookshelf that this was a genuine maze - each path forking off into a different one, leading back around to the same one, or tangenting far off into the distance. Space and relativity began to lose meaning the further he pushed into the labyrinth. Minutes turned to hours turned to... more hours. Let's not get nuts.

But then... the most horrifying sight imaginable crept into Flinch's vision in the distance. Panic set into his very soul as he pushed past a small woman reading a 100 year old copy of Jane Eyre with vinyled pages, almost throwing her into the shelf next to her. "No.. no nooo. no no.." he continually muttered to himself, becoming more panicked each time he could peer past the books and columns and see it again. By the time he'd come upon it he wanted to collapse to his knees and scream, but he knew it would do him no good.

"Stairs to sub-floor 2." was written over a doorway at the end of the aisle. He had been wandering this fucking labyrinthine sprawling library for what felt like an enternity already and this was just the FIRST FLOOR?!

Flinch placed his hands over his head and turned away from the door, pacing in place a moment trying to decide whether it was worth it to push on or not. He'd been having the same horrifying recurring nightmares for months now and had never had a moment of rest in that entire time but this was so much EFFORT.

Across the long aisle from the door was a tall, thin hole in the wall, a little wider than the average person, with a rope dangling down in the center of it. A dumbwaiter in a library...? A smarter man would have realized that the best way to haul lots of books between floors would be a contraption like this but Flinch mostly just figured it was for throwing trash down or something. He dug out a half-eaten Baby Ruth from the inside pocket of his coat he'd left there a couple weeks ago and down it like a pelican hoarks a fish, balled up the wrapped and tossed it into the abyss. Might as well fucking press on, he thought.

I'll spare you the next couple hours of Flinch fucking about on the sub-floor, bumping into people and not apologizing, eating old food, pissing in corners when he thinks no one is looking, you know - Flinch shit. Eventually he found himself in a nook deep in the back of the aisles which had glass cases on all three sides leading into it, and a small entrance behind the case to the right.

I do want to take a moment to let you the audience know that I'm not making any of this shit up about Morrow Library and The Stacks. They make you give them your I.D. card to KEEP with them at the entrance in case you get lost down there and they need to call the police to come and find you and get you out using the map they have. There are several sub-floors and side rooms and you could easily spend hours down there. I got to what I thought was the bottom once and there was a locked maintenance-style door with chains across it and a padlock like in fucking Silent Hill and the sign next to it said "Public Records" and a smaller added sign said "Lower floors closed for maintenance." There could be literally anything down there and I'd believe that shit.

Aaaaaaanyway

Flinch swallowed his fear, and the remnants of Baby Ruth, and slid into the thin opening behind the glass case of books, shimmying out the other side to find... yet another aisle of books. What the fuck could all of these god damn things even say? Flinch thought to himself ruefully. Who has this much shit they need to write down?

In the distance past the aisle he stood in he heard the sound of books slapping against the bare concrete floor, and a voice murmuring. Flinch reached for his gun but realized he was in a school on federal property and had also forgotten his holster at Jolly Pirate Donuts yesterday anyway. He proceeded with caution.

Turning the corner into the next aisle he saw the person in question - a black woman in her mid-40's with a single gray streak in her teased out long hair, carrying a cane in his left hand and holding a gigantic book entitled "The Penumbra Conspiracy" in her right. Not that he saw race or anything, he was color-blind to that or not, whichever was considered good these days he wasn't gonna keep up.

For her part the woman peeked over the book to look at him for a moment then went back to reading it. A full ten seconds passed before she flung the book down to her side and gaped wide-eyed at Flinch, a look of recognition and disgust on her face usually reserved for people who knew him well.

"YOU?!" she screamed in a husky, weathered voice, pointing at him with her cane. He had gotten closed enough at this point that he almost ran into it chest-first but stopped at the last second.

He took a step back and stuttered out "Uhm...yeah.. me...hello... my name is--"

"Pavlov Flinch." She said ruefully. "I know who you are. You've been haunting my dreams along with everything else for years. I started to think you weren't ever going to show up."

"...what the shit?" Flinch took a step back, folding his coat together to hide himself like someone had peeped his Lil' Flinch against his will. "How in the fuck do you know who I am? My father doesn't even know who I am."

He paused for a moment, "Wait, dreams? Have you been having the red moon dreams too?!"

She raised an eyebrow at this and sat down the large book she was holding on the pile she'd made on the floor, a poof of dust rising into the air between them. "Yeah... been having them since 99 when I last saw one in person."

"You're Kayla Hunter?" Flinch reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a book, holding it out to Kayla.

She took the book and turned it over, crinkling her nose in disgust and looking back at him with wild disbelief "Human Sexuality and Taboos? Look you little scumbag if I have to kill a man this is probably the best place to do-"

"OH shit shit no no no that's for big papa, " he said plainly, snatching the book back and tucking it into his jacket. He retrieved a smaller leather journal and handed it to her instead. "I mean this one."

"My old journal... you're the one who found it?" She looked deeply disgusted and disappointed, a look Flinch was used to both inside and outside the bedroom pretty equally, but then became thoughtful for a moment. "Well I guess it makes sense why you've been sliming around my nightmares being a little creep. You're a little creep in real life."

"Well not officially or anything, legally you can't be considered--" but Flinch's slow burn explanation for his accurate level of deviancy was interrupted. The lights began to flicker above them as footsteps echoed off the stucco walls and metallic shelves down a nearby aisle.

Kayla Hunter leaned down to the floor and peered underneath the shelves bottom level across the extensive floor. She could see tattered old sandals hitting the floor, but dragging along the concrete behind them was the end of a robe, red wreathed in white. She shot back up and held her cane aloft like a weapon, backing further down the aisle. She held up a single finger to her lips to signal Flinch to shut up.

Kayla grabbed Flinch by the shoulder and lead him around the next corner aisle, pressing his back against it and then hers. Both of them leaned around the books to peer from behind them into the aisle they'd left behind.

Flinch instantly recognized the hippy from outside, who walked around the end of the aisle and sat his beat up old guitar against the shelving unit closest. Tucked under his left arm was the old timey music box he'd been seated next to outside. The only thing different about him from then was the long red and white robe he wore loosely dangling around his body, its hood high and pointed, and red with some esoteric symbol burnished into the fabric over the forehead.

He placed the music box at his feet and opened it gingerly, pressing down onto the mechanism that spun the small red record within it. He lowered the player head onto it, and after a few small scratching tones, the cacophony began.

Wailing high screeching tones filled the subterranean halls, held aloft by droning, deep, guttural bass tones that shook the shelves, books falling into the floor and smashing into bits from their own age and the force exerted. Kayla and Flinch covered their ears and gritted their teeth, trying not to scream from the pain of it, but neither could draw their eyes from the hooded figure before them.

The hippy threw his head back and though it looked like he was screaming with everything in him, either no sound came out of him at all, or it wasn't loud enough to pierce the sound of the music box. He shook violently, his entire body wracked with an inhuman jerking and lunging that caused him to smash into the shelves next to him and cause even further damage. His fingers gripped so tightly into fists that his fingernails drew blood from his skin and once enough had spilt his threw the rivulets into the air and screamed silently once more, his jaw elongating grotesquely

From deep within his throat, down in his gullet, they came. Twisting, encircling, spewing some unknown fluid and dripping it from every inch - writhing in on themselves and turning - tentacles. His human face was ripped apart as they burst from the entire from his head then, swirling and rippling in a way no living flesh could ever dream. The droning of the music box continued as what was once a human being now stood still, the tentacles hanging limply from the hole in his head, and his shoulders slumped forward.

Hechh... GLUHGH!!

It bellowed as it spewed forth a small form from within the center of the now-again swirling tentacled mass, the thing hitting the floor with a grotesque splat. It writhed and wriggled for a moment before long, thin, skeletal spider's legs erupted from its sides and it righted itself onto them, skittering down the aisle toward where Flinch was hidden.

He nearly squealed in fear, turning his eyes over to Kayla who... was gone. Like, out. She was nowhere in fucking sight anymore. He gritted his teeth in a mixture of frustration and terror and began running as fast as his shitty dollar store loafers could take him down the aisle and away from the skittering thing.

Hecchh... GLUGH!!...Hecchh... GLUGH!!

The room, even filled to the brim with the wall of nearly omnipresent sound from the music box, echoed with the sound of each new offspring the tentacle-faced thing spat onto the floor, no doubt sending it skittering after each and every time.

Flinch turned a corner and caught the tail end of Kayla's leather coat fluttering behind her as she turned left around the end of this aisle. He at least knew where to follow now. He ran as fast as he could - which wasn't very considering - but still made it to the end of the row before the nearly inaudible woman's scream reached his ears. He swung around the end of the aisle and saw where it had originated

Kayla lay on the floor, her hands grasping the dripping thin legs of one of the offspring as its elongated maw opened wider and wider to try to reach her face. She looked back at Flinch and mouthed the words "Do something!" but no sound escaped. Later, if they survived, this would be his out to be like, I didn't understand, sorry, I can't read lips, and not get in trouble. Foolproof.

Kayla pressed her knees against the thing's abdomen and pushed with all of her might. Flinch noticed finally that this thing was probably four times its original size at this point - about the size of a golden retriever - which would have made him shit his pants even harder if he'd any shit to give. Thank god he didn't.

With an extreme amount of exertion, Kayla pressed her knees up and sent the thing flying back away from her. She fumbled momentarily to grab her walking cane, but swung it around just in time to smash the wooden head of it into the side of the thing to stop it from leaping back onto her. She grasped the bottom of the cane and yanked, sliding it down and away from the handle to reveal a pristine silver blade underneath it, the length of the cane almost to a point.

She screamed silently amongst the cacophony once more and plunged the sword deep into the things mouth and through the bottom of its body as it came at her again, causing it to squeal out loud enough to be heard even, fling it's legs around wildly, desperately, then fall still and silent.

Kayla withdrew her black and slid it back into the sheath she was carrying, spilling a small amount of strange translucent green liquid from within the sheath onto the concrete floor as she did. She got back to her feet no problem after and motioned for Flinch to follow her.

"WHAT THE FUCK WAS ALL THAT SHIT?!" Flinch screamed wordlessly, but Kayla had already begun running down the aisle away from him so he started to follow the best he could.

The droning seemed to be getting louder, Flinch could feel a small trickle of blood running down his cheek underneath his ear which didn't seem great, but really was probably not in his top 5 worries right now.

They kept turning aisle after aisle and kept finding nothing but more and more rows of books and books and more books. The exit was most assuredly back in the other direction - they had come in through it after all. This seemed like a mostly sealed-off section of the library so where were they even headed? Flinch really, really hoped that Kayla knew.

The skittering became so loud... even louder than the music box, filling the entire expanse of the cramped walkways and pathways of the underground. At this point Flinch was hesitant to guess how many of those things were following them. Shelves were visibly being yanked down and falling over from the weight behind them to the point he stopped even looking back - running through the visceral pain in every muscle and joint of his body, running for his life in a way you can't understand unless you ever have yourself.

Then there it was. They turned a corner and they were standing in front of an enormous, deep, black hole in the stucco wall. A cavernous maw of black that reached from floor to low ceiling and seemed to go up even further beyond where the ceiling would have met the wall. They both stopped there, dead in their tracks, staring, transfixed. The endless darkness within it was unknowable but for some reason beckoning for them, and neither could pull away for a moment.

For his part, Pavlov Flinch had spent the better part of his childhood hiding away from his parents, truancy officers, mall security guards, victims of theft, and other unruly authority figures inside small locals caves so he knew exactly what the feeling of standing at the mouth of a cave was supposed to feel like. The cold, stagnate air from within the cave in front of you, heralding the darkness within, and the free-flowing wind of the outside world hitting your back, grasping at you to stay above. But this was the exact opposite somehow. The free-flowing wind of the outside world blew at him from within the cavernous darkness... the sheer size of the void within must have been monumental... he couldn't even fathom it from the feeling deep within his gut.

But his reverie was interrupted as a hand latched onto his shoulder and yanked him away from the hole and back toward the reality of their situation. The offspring of the creature were climbing up the other side of the aisle they stood on the side of, their backs against the stucco off-white of one wall, and the bleak emptiness of the hole at the other. Their skittering, the cacophony of sound of the music box, the beating of their hearts in their ears, and even over all of it they heard the inhuman voice flowing over them from beyond even the offspring

"Dominus......dominus......dominus..."

When all of the hope had drained from them, out of the corner of Flinch's eye, he saw their salvation. A thin, tall hole in the wall, pitch black within it, and a dangling rope barely moving around a silver Baby Ruth wrapped on the bottom of the box.

Flinch ran full tilt past Kayla, her head whipping around to follow his motion, and leapt at the dumbwaiter in the wall from almost too far away, his face slamming into the wall below it, but his hands latching onto the edge. Just as he was about to try to crawl in however, Kayla yanked him away from it, threw him the bird HARD, and grabbed onto the rope within. She gripped her cane in her teeth and hand over fist began shimmying herself up into the tight space of the dumbwaiter. Her boots disappeared beyond the edge of it by the time Flinch had grabbed back on to the rope himself.

"God damn it!" he mimed, yanking himself up as hard as he could, but not gaining much traction up the rope. He'd faked being sick every single time rope climbing had come up in gym back in school so he had absolutely zero experience with it. This also extended to dodgeball, sit-up competitions, jumping jacks, and a myriad other gym-related activities that seemed way less important at the moment.

He had just gotten himself fully into the dumbwaiter, feeling somewhat squeezed by his size and the width of the opening, when one of those horrific offspring began shoving it's sharp, thin, legs into the opening, stabbing viciously at Flinch's legs, barely missing every swipe thanks to him swinging his legs as wildly and randomly as he could.

Something latched onto the massive offspring from behind and yanked it away from the opening, and Flinch felt a fleeting moment of hope for himself, looking up the rope to see Kayla continuing to climb up into the darkness, but when he dropped his eyes back out the dumbwaiter into the library he saw in the offspring's place, the original creature itself, it's massive thrumming and throbbing set of dozens upon dozens of tentacles squirming from the bloodless gap where it's face used to be, swirling inward toward his dangling legs.

He was screaming, he knew it, but he just couldn't hear it. All he could hear was the drone of the music box and the squirming, dripping squelching of tentacles.

But they didn't find him. His body lurched upward into the dumbwaiter, faster and hard, in one sudden yank. Then another. He wondered for a moment if he had found the strength to haul himself up through instinct and adrenaline alone, but it dawned on him quickly - he was being reeled in using the dumbwaiter rope from above! He held on as tightly as he could, looking down only momentarily to see the tentacles slowly, drippingly recoiling away from sight.

The droning of the music box was so far away by the time that he was pulled from the dumbwaiter door from above and thrown onto the cold, hard cement of the first floor of the Stacks, he could barely feel the pain in his head any longer. He let out a loud, sudden scream, he'd been holding in his chest the entire trip up that echoed across the metal shelves and stucco walls still surrounding them.

There was silence for a long moment.... Was it... over?

A bunch of normal human voices, disgruntled and over-caffinated students, piped up here and there on the floor, yelling "SHUT THE FUCK UP, THIS IS A LIBRARY!" and "PIPE THE FUCK DOWN I HAVE FINALS TOMORROW!!" at him. After all of that it was all so damn... normal.

Kayla grabbed him by the lapels of his overcoat and dragged him up to his feet, ushering him along like a child out of the stacks entirely. The trip must have lasted a pretty long while to make it back out but it felt like a minute at the absolute most before they were shoving open the tinted double doors of Morrow Library and stepping back out into the sun.

He flopped onto a bench and put his head in his hands for a moment and Kayla sat next to him, gripping her cane and balancing against it. There weren't any words exchanged between them for a long time.

Every so often the double doors to Morrow would swing open and the two of them would tighten up and fear would shoot through them like a bullet before a couple students would walk out talking or laughing and all that tension would slowly escape.

"Look..." Pavlov Flinch finally broke the silence "I don't wanna fucking be sittin here with my thumb up my ass when that thing finishes checking out some light psychotic monster reading and comes on out to flay our skin off so... " He slowly rose to his feet.

Kayla Hunter stood up as well, grasping him round the arm and yanking him back before he had a chance to walk away. She narrowed her eyes and gritted her teeth, speaking through them as if to a child, "Fine then, Flinch... you and I got a town to find anyway. You read the journal, you know where we're goin' next..."

"Whoa, whoa, whoa..." Flinch protested, whinily, "I didn't sign up for any of this shit. I just wanted to stop having bad dreams. I'm not tryin' to get buttfucked by the Loch Ness Monster or the Jersey Devil or whatever! I just wanna sleep!"

"You were in my dreams about all of this, Flinch. Those dreams started the day after I saw The Blood Moon and the train from the journal and they haven't stopped since. I've learned a LOT of shit since then, man. Shit that will turn your pale ass even whiter. All of it began with the disappearance of Buffalo Creek township and that's exactly where I'm gonna get some answers."

"Why the fuck didn't you get them in the twenty-plus years since you fell ass-backwards into a Scary Story to Tell in the Dark then?!" Flinch yelled

"I have, dipshit! There's no town there anymore! There's just a fence, a bunch of open field, then a big empty fucking lot!" Kayla screamed back. Passing students had stopped to listen to them fight at this point. Maybe fists would be thrown? They all hoped.

"Then why would today be any different?!" Flinch screamed back, the adrenaline from earlier returning to his veins or else the sight of a woman screaming at him would have scared him to death and/or given him an unquenchable boner.

"Because, Flinch... " Kayla had noticed the growing crowd and spoke in a hushed tone, pushing him toward the stairs that led back up to Old Main. The two of them walked to the top and standing side by side, Kayla pointed up at the sky above them.

It was around 7:30 at this point, and the sun was fairly low in the sky, so it was already visible.

"Tonight's the Blood Moon."

The End
