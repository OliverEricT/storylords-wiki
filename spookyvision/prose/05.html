A Stroke of the Blade
Prompt: Katanas & Socks
by Jeff Pennington


"You can't sleep here, this is a library!!" The shrill, hateful words of the librarian echoed off of the books and glass cases that surrounded the old mahogany table, piercing the ears of the very few late night patrons of the Municipal Library and setting their teeth on edge all at once. 

Pavlov Flinch, Private Eye rolled over and peered through the blurry haze that sleep had pulled over his eyes, letting out a long, hoarse yawn in response. He was laying directly in the middle of the table, using several opened Atlases as a blanket and a copy of the Bible as a pillow when he was so rudely interrupted.

"Look lady, I'm sorry the library foreman doesn't pay you enough to shop at your own library but I was almost at the good part of the dream where the One Direction dude reveals he's actually a woman so all my urges are ok and then we buy one-way tickets to bone town. Could you come back after I've at least got to the wet part in the wet dream?" 

"L.. library... foreman..?" the librarian stuttered for a moment before regaining her composure. "Look sir, either you read a book like a civilized person or I'll call the cops and let them throw you out for me! I'll ever tell them you once went to a protest to exercise your constitutional rights! Cops HATE other peoples constitutional rights!"

"Fine, fine! You sound like my mom... or the next door neighbors The Matthews. Or the staff at the Waffle House on 7th. I'll pick up one of your disgusting "books" and "read" it if you'll "fuck off" and "eat shit." Flinch made air quotes around each of those phrases, but continuously, like he didn't really know what air quotes were. Jesus. 

"I don't give two fucks of a shit, just don't jizz anywhere." The librarian muttered as she walked away, contemplating how she got to this point in her life. Was her mom really right after all? Should she have settled down with a nice man with a good job and made a family? Had she really missed out on everything that life had to offer just for this? Well her mom was dead as fuck and she wasn't so score one for Librarian, which isn't her actually name but I'm not taking the time to come up with one for her so fuck it. And also fuck her mom what kinda of 1950's ass Leave it to Beaver shit is she peddling anyway? This story is set in the present right now so her whole steez is just as horse shit as you think it is.

Flinch searched the shelves nearby idly, not really taking in any of the titles, but instead thinking about how he had dropped his sandwich when he was running from The Matthews new Rottweiler. Had they gotten it to keep him out? No... couldn't be! The Matthews love him and he loves The Matthews. Especially their hot tub. God he was gonna miss that sandwich though.

Eventually he noticed a large leather-bound book sitting on a shelf by itself under an imposingly large glass case. He picked it up, feeling the heft in his arms. It reminded him of that time he'd been asked by a passerby to hold their baby for a moment except he held onto the book the whole time this time. 

He squinted his eyes in the dim library room, lit only by several small gold lamps that littered the tops of tables here and there, except the one he had dreamed a beautiful completely heterosexual dream on earlier. 

The title of the book he held in his hands was "The Tale of Tachibana." There wasn't a name anywhere on the book besides this one. No author, no publisher, no nothing. Flinch shrugged and set it down on the table, and slid into one of the chairs underneath it. 

At a 3rd grade level, he began to read....

-----

The blood moon hung low in the sky over the countryside, dying everything its light touched a sanguine scarlet. The wind swayed through the thickets and the leaves, meeting the incessant tones of insects amongst the thrush to create a symphony of night. The pathways were clear by this time, well past the setting of the sun, and long beyond the time when normal folk had laid their weary heads down to the rest.

But still, the old samurai pressed on. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say the old Ronin pressed on. Tachibana had once served a lord who's name no longer mattered, nor his legacy, as it had all burned to the ground in the fires of war. Now he served no one but himself. He had learned the lesson long ago that the only thing in this world that could be relied upon were his own wits and his sword arm, and lived by no code beyond that. At his hip hung loosely a scabbard of finest sandalwood, enwreathed in velvet and inlaid with gold. Within it snugly fit the instrument responsible for the future he desired to cut from the countryside before him, and the past written in blood behind.

"One hundred forty seven bottles of beer on the wall! One hundred fourty seven bottles of beeeeeeerr!!" Hiroshi screeched, bouncing up and down in a small circle around Tachibana, his arms outstretched and eyes closed. 

"UGGGHHHHHHH" screamed Tachibana, his hands dragging down his own face in frustration. 

Hiroshi was technically, for all intents and purposes, Tachibana's apprentice. But in all actuality, the young idiot was simply another burden placed upon him by poor decision making in the past. 

You see, Little Hiroshi had burst in while Tachibana was hilt deep in his mom's scabbard and the only way to make him stop screaming bloody murder was to explain to him that it was some kind of ancient apprenticeship ritual. And that stuff his mom was cleaning up afterward was... apprenticeship juice. 

His real mistake was falling asleep that night, for when he awakened the next morning Hiroshi's mother had long gone, leaving behind a small note that simple stated, "He's your problem now you limp-dicked FUCK." Tachibana's dick was never limp but he supposed the note was for him, anyway. 

"You take one down, you pass it around... one hundred forty six bottles of beer on the waaalll!!" Hiroshi caterwauled, back in the present past of this past tale and not the past past that the last flashback was set in. You get it. "Onnnne hundred forty six bottles of beer on the wall! One hun--"

Tachibana slapped his hand over Hiroshi's mouth, stopping the song in it's tracks, his eyes red with the fires of hatred. "Will... you.. SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY?! You've been at it for HOURS and I promise you if you don't stop, I will KILL YOU."

"Aw, Tachibana-sensei, you'd never kill me! You love me like a father does!" Hiroshi beamed with pride once his mentor had removed his hand.

"I've never felt love in my life." Tachibana said emotionlessly.

"HAW HAW you're so funny, Tachibana-sensei!" Hiroshi giggled, but stopped when something caught his eye. He pointed down the path. "Look, sensei, a shrine! I almost thought about a titty today - We should pray away our filthy filthy sins and repent before a higher power!"

"Look you little fuck--" Tachibana began but Hiroshi had already taken off down the path at a full run. It wasn't that Hiroshi was just annoying, no, it was far worse than that. From the night he had porked the kid's mom into oblivion and back Tachibana had never once scored. Every time he was unsheathing Tachibana Jr. and getting ready for fucksville, Hiroshi would bust in with a pinwheel or a frog or some other stupid stereotypical shit for a kid to get excited about and the lady would dry up like a fishing hole during drought season. Hiroshi was a living, cock-blocking, illiterate to the point of not even knowing what letters are, CURSE on his life.

"OH BOY! RELIGION!" Hiroshi shouted as he ran up to the small shrine situated by the road and dropped to his knees, clapping his hands together in front of him. 

The shrine was incredibly old, to the point that Tachibana couldn't really make out what any of the lettering upon it meant. It wasn't kanji but something much, much older that was scrawled in peeling, tattering red pigment upon the seals pock-marking the shrine from top to bottom. He looked over them for several moments before giving up trying to figure out which deity this shrine was in honor to. "Hurry it up, we need to get to the next town before daybreak."

"Wait, Tachibana-sensei, aren't you going to pray for absolution for the heinous sins of the flesh we all wallow within as mortal shells?"

"...what?" Tachibana looked back at the kid bewildered before shaking his head. "No! I don't give a shit about any of that. I have a river of blood at my feet for the things I've done, and there's no penance for that. Not that I'd even care to."

"Aw c'mon, Tachibana-sensei! Repent and flagellate! Repent and flagellate! Repent and flagellate!" Hiroshi bobbed up and down to the clearly religiously anachronistic repetition of his own words, before standing back up and running in a circle around Tachibana once more, for the one-millionth time since the Ronin had gotten laid. "Repent and flagellate! Repent and flagellate! Repent and flagellate!"

Tachibana stood stock-still, his blood boiling in his veins, his head bowed down low. The boy encircled him, tugging at his obi and his sleeves with each turn around him. "Repent and flagellate!" he continued on and on and on, Tachibana's body shaking with a fury he had not felt since he saw the burning castle of his lord - who he had dedicated his entire life to serving and honoring above all - burning to the ground with everyone he knew inside of it. 

"REPENT AND FLAGGELATE!"

Tachibana didn't even notice it at first. The way his hand gripped onto the hilt of his katana by itself. The hatred boiled the blood within his veins. He hadn't gotten his dick wet in FIVE YEARS at this point. He hadn't slept a single night without the wheezing phlemgy breathing of this little brat in his ears in FIVE YEARS. He hadn't had a moments peace alone to even YANK HIS OWN DICK OFF in FIVE YEARS.

The blood red moon flashed in the silvery steel of his blade as it found it's target. The katana had found it's sheath once more before the boy's head hit the ground. The penance had been paid, the guillotine had found it's guilty target, and the night was suddenly silent again. For the first time in five years, the night was silent.

The enormity of what he had done suddenly hit him as the boy's body slumped to the ground in a heap before him. He had been operating on nothing but instinct, but blind virulent hatred, and had done the unthinkable, the unfathomable

"....oh well!" He continued on his journey down the path, whistling jauntily to himself in the night. 

Behind him, beyond his notice, the blood of the slain youth slowly ran in rivulets down the side of the ancient shrine. The lettering slowly twisted and warped at the blasphemous intrusion.

Eventually Tachibana came upon a town, far north of where he had left Horshi' or whatever his name was' dead ass body. He looked over the small tattered map he carried along with him of the region but for the life of him couldn't find this town marked anywhere on this map. The nearest town was Kaiba, which was another three hours trek to the north. 

He turned his gaze up toward the marker over the entrance to the town, which bore very old tattered red pigment lettering upon it spelling out a name he was completely unfamiliar with - "Yomiko". Something about the name seemed vaguely familiar but he didn't dwell upon it. He was weary from his travels and desirous of nothing more than a soft bed to sleep upon. 

By this point it was far past midnight, closer to the rising of the sun than the setting though still deep into the darkest hours yet the streets were alight with people moving to and fro, as if about their daily business. Tachibana stroked his chin thoughtfully as he wandered through the town, watching the people go about their chores but oh so slowly. A miller turned the crank to his mechanism, grinding the milt within it into grain, but only idly, his eyes downcast and his arms moving at a snails pace. A woman hung clothing to dry on a line but she continuously stopped to hold her stomach, as if trying to fight away a stomach ache, perhaps? But she still moved so slowly. An old man sat upon a seat in front of a storefront, turned from the street and idly drinking from a small gourd, without a hint of alacrity in his body. 

Tachibana rubbed his eyes a little, feeling a sense of unease gripping him deep within his chest, but blamed it all upon the exhaustion in him. Perhaps he was simply perceiving everything at the pace he himself was moving in his hazy-minded sleep deprivation. Keep in mind this dude decapitated a teenager like two hours ago, you'd think he'd be more concerned about that but whatever, I guess

He sat eyes upon an inn at the other side of the square and made a beeline to it. Not one person in the town even looked at him. Not with malice or with confusion - they simply did not even acknowledge his existence. He was inside the front doors and standing before the counter before the first person even noted his presence. 

A beautiful woman slowly stood from behind the counter, holding a duster and a rag in her hand as if she had been cleaning the floor. She smiled a weak but kind smile to him, averting her eyes before addressing him. "Welcome to the Yomiko Inn, Master Samurai." she said with a demure smile. Was it finally time for Tachibana to get his fucks on? Read on to find out!

"Ah thank you but..." Tachibana paused, examining the young woman's face as best he could in the dimly lit foyer of the inn. There was something incredibly familiar about her, but he could not place it for the life of him. She seemed so close to the forefront of his memory but he could not coalesce the fog within into anything tangible. "Hm... what does it cost to stay here for a night?"

"A night...?" she spoke in a hoarse whisper, her hand slowly rubbing at her throat to sooth it. "I'm afraid we don't sell rooms by the single night, Master Samurai..."

"What?!" Tachibana slammed his hand onto the desk between them with force, though the woman did not react in the slightest. "What kind of establishment is this?! I demand to be allowed to stay here tonight!"

"Oh... you misunderstand...Master Samurai..." She looked up at him fully for the first time. Two deep, endless voids met Tachibana's gaze. Holes where her eyes had once been, slowly tricking blood from deep within them down her beautiful face, down her neck where a gigantic open gash revealed the spine at the back of her throat. Her voice gurgled up through her neck now, not the sweet and deferent tones from before but harsh and clicking "We offer you a room to stay for all of you nights to come..."

Tachibana screamed, drawing back away from the desk, he fumbled his hand for the katana at his side and found nothing in it's place. The scabbard that hung low from his hip was completely empty. He turned upon his heels and ran out the door, screaming at the people of the town around him at the top of his lungs

"A demon!! A demon lives here!"

The miller turned to him, stopping his slow but steady cranking of his milling machine, grinning slightly as he stood from his place at the mechanism. His arm remained gripping at the handle to the churn , dangling lifelessly as his body pulled away from it. A clean, severed cut at the shoulder, long long ago. The miller lurched toward Tachibana, his other arm, still attached to his body, reaching out to him. "A demon indeed.... a demon dressed as an honorable samurai..." 

Tachibana turned away, but met the gaze of the woman hanging clothes to dry, who turned toward him, and removed her hand from her stomach. Blood began to pour from a single slash across her midsection, followed by the entrails once held within, spilling across the sandy dirt beneath her. She too raised her arms toward the ronin and began to walk toward him, her voice unstrained and unharmed by her horrific injury. "A demon who slew any who refused him what he coveted..."

The man seated outside the market slowly began to stand from his chair, but fell directly into the dirt in front of it instead. He legs remained resting against the legs of the old chair, motionless and bereft of life as his upper body dragged itself along the earth toward Tachibana, his arms outstretching toward him, his guts trailing behind him in the dirt. "A demon who murdered anyone who stood in his way..."

Screaming and running Tachibana went, passing by person after person who turned toward him and outstretched arms to follow. Some without faces, some without heads, some with grievous wounds, some burnt beyond recognition, but all of them following him at their pace, their voices ringing out hollow words he refused to listen to. 

But even he had to stop in his tracks as he turned the next corner. Standing before him, smoldering and twisted by flame to the point of almost being unrecognizable - was the Lord he had once pledged his undying eternal service under. His eyes burned like seething dying coals in a hearth but no warmth exuded from him. He pointed his twisted blackened finger toward the once-proud samurai, and his voice was painfully breathed out of him like the last vestiges of lost life "A demon who abandoned his post.... who ran from his duty to save himself... and damned two thousand souls to hell in his place..."

"NNNOOO!!" Tachibana screamed, pushing past the moldering corpse of his once proud master and charging away from him at full clip, tears streaming down his face. He ran, and ran, and ran, but every time he would reach the high gates at the edge of the town he would find himself immediately running through the gates at it's other edge - an unending Möbius strip every single time. Still, he ran past the horrific apparitions, each one he now noticed wearing nothing but their tabi socks upon their feet - and each one perfectly clean and untouched by the dirt and silt they walked upon.

Hours passed, fatigue poisoned every muscle in his body, pain tore at every tendon, fire burning in every ligament, but Tachibana ran. From one side of the town, to the other. From one end of the wall to the other end, trying to climb over here, jump through there, go under here. All the while the collective voices of the spectres haunting him within this village growing louder and louder in his ears. 

Finally he collapsed in the middle of the town square, sobbing loudly to himself, grasping at the dirt for anything, any kind of answer, any kind of escape. 

"A demon who would murder the only person in the world who had ever loved him as family." 

He looked up and saw before him a young man, standing clutching his severed head under one arm, and his own katana in the other hand. Hiroshi stared down at him with a blank, twisted, grotesque expression, hatred seething within his eyes. 

"Please... please..! It was a mistake! I'm sorry! I regret it now, I regret everything!"

The miller was here now. And the woman who had hung clothes. And the man from the market. And the feudal lord long burned and buried stood here as well. Even the eyeless woman who had tended the inn stood over him, each of them peering down at him with revulsion in their hearts. 

"Everything...?" they asked in unison.

It suddenly became very clear who each of them were. 

The miller had refused to give Tachibana his millet for free and the Ronin had taken his arm as penance. He must have bled to death afterward, he didn't even stay around long enough to see, it meant so little to him. 

The woman who had been hanging clothes rebuked his advances and tried to go about her normal job at the laundry to avoid him while he was visiting her town. He had found her at closing and disemboweled her in revenge. 

The man who had been seated at the market had hired him to catch some bandits who were bedeviling his local town but when Tachibana had been unable to find them, had refused to give him the payment anyway. He had been lobbed in half for this affront. 

The woman without eyes... how could he have forgotten her? She was the woman who had taken him in after the fire had taken the castle. She nursed him back to health and had professed her love for him. The two had lived together for months, had slept together for all of it, before she announced to him that she was expecting. He had slit her throat to silence her, thrown her from the top of the cliff, and even from his vantage point he had seen the carrion birds peck out her eyes from her corpse after it had landed.

"I.... I ask for mercy...! I will make penance...! I will do anything!" Tachibana screamed, raising his hands to the apparitions of those he had wronged so deeply.

"You will." Hiroshi said flatly, raising the katana to the sky and catching the glint of the blood red moon above before bringing it down. 

"AGHH...!!" Tachibana shot up straight, letting out a gasping, airless scream into the dead of night. He found himself laying in a field, the tall grasses blowing serenly in the night's wind, the blood red moon dangling overhead, and everything as he had left it before. He stared into the middle distance for a long, long time, desperately trying to piece together the dream he had just had - the one that still perturbed him beyond even remembrance - but he couldn't. Whatever he had dreamed was beyond him now. 

He stood and dusted himself off, unsheathing his katana from it's scabbard and examining the blood upon it. He had done what needed to be done to Hiroshi and now was free! The night was finally silent for the first time in five years. 

Down the road a little further he spotted a town that wasn't upon his map. He had shrugged it off, worried more about his fatigue than whether or not his map was up to date. Something about the name of the place was familiar however, and set him slightly upon edge, though he paid that no mind either. "Yomiko"... why was that so familiar?

The End

-----

Pavlov Flinch closed the book tight and tossed it onto the floor carelessly with an incredibly loud thump. He peered through the darkness of the dimly lit library in one direction, then the other, and gathered up all of those atlases he had been sleeping under earlier, hopped back up onto the table, and went back to sleepytown - hopefully to meet that One Direction chick again and get to pound town before the cops showed up - in the dream or in real life.

The blood red moon hung low in the sky above the skylight of the municipal library. Above the shelf where "The Tale of Tachibana" was originally held, within the gigantic class display case, the moon's sanguine light shimmered brightly even across the rusted antique blade of the katana. 

The red glint shone so brightly that it almost created a spotlight, drenching the table below in scarlet ambience, like blood dying the world red. 

It shone upon Pavlov Flinch. It dove deeply into him, and within his dream, the night began again.

The End but For Real This Time
