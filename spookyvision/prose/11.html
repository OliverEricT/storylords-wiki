	Mickey the Mack was the most dangerous, hunkiest, heart-throbbingest 22 year old at John Adams High School; a guy who had coasted through grade levels due to pity from school faculty and the general malaise of the American public school system far more than any schoolwork he’d ever done. At this point in history there was no maximum age for schooling so here he still was. Tall, athletic, and with a great head of hair slathered in nothing but the finest dapper dan, you’d more than likely find Mickey hanging around the hallways during classes and trying to figure out if he’d have to pay taxes or not this year - it was never entirely clear if being a student canceled out the fact he was enrolled in selective service or not.
</p>
<p>
	The lunch bell rang out clarion clear and he turned to peer down the hallway toward the lunch room doors. He slid his aviators down his face and peered over them as the doors swung open and a deluge of pretty chickens came rushing out of them down the hall, each one plumper and more ready for him to sink his teeth into than the last. They clucked and sent feathers flying everywhere as they ran down the hall in confusion and panic - it must be time for Senior Pranks again. Also there were hot girls there.
</p>
<p>
	“ Hey there pretty lady, when are you and I gonna make it up to Lover’s Leap together and… take the plunge?” Mickey said with a twirl of the toothpick in his mouth and a grin that would get you 5 to 10 these days if you did it unsolicited to a woman.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh Mickey, you’re incorrigible!” Sherry Seasons said with a wide, bright smile, dimples showing in her cheeks in that way people really fucking loved back then for some reason. I don’t even wanna try to psychoanalyze that. She walked up to him and leaned against the locker next to him, holding her books packed neatly together with a bow in front of her.
</p>
<p>
	“That’s not an answer, eh?” Mickey said with another, somehow even RYE-ER grin at her. He flicked out a pocket knife and held it up in the air, giving it a quick flick out – when his wrist was caught in mid-air.
</p>
<p>
	“You brought a KNIFE to school, Mickey Fine?!” Principal Buttsavage yelled out, yanking Mickey’s hand over towards him to get a better look at the knife. He was a middle aged man with a paunch and a combover - imagine like a Mr. Belding but not even remotely lovable - just ask this guy’s ex-wife. HI-OHH! “It’s a switchblade, even! This is it, the last straw I was looking for! I’m gonna ship you off to military school for this one!”
</p>
<p>
	“Cool it, pops! It ain’t the last nothin’.” Mickey said with a cool attitude that only the greasiest greaser could pull off. (Note to editor: cut this line out if it turns out to be a slur) Mickey yanked his hand away from the Principal and flicked the end of the switchblade out… revealing a fine tooth comb which he smugly slipped through his gooey ass raven locks. “ We got a problem now?”
</p>
<p>
	“No… but I’m watching you, mister..! You better watch your back!” Principal Buttsavaged stammered out, huffing and puffing as he waddled away down the hallway with all the bravado and gusto of a poorly drawn Donald Duck. This character will never ever return in a story so feel free to forget I bothered to write this part.
</p>
<p>
	“Wow, Mickey, that was a close one…!” Sherry said with audible horniness in her voice, just like everyone did when they were dealing with Mickey. “I think I’ll take you up on that trip to Lover’s Lane or whatever you called it earlier, I’m not scrolling up!”
</p>
<p>
	“Alriiiiight.” Mickey said with a grin and a flick of his comb through his hair again.
</p>
<p>
	“You really are the coolest, Mickey!” Sherry yelled out, and everyone in the hallway turned to look at her with a confused look. “R…right guys? Let’s all hear it for Mickey!”
</p>
<p>
	The other students looked between each other for a moment and then turned away, returning to their business in the background, the din of their conversation sometimes interspersed with “What the fuck was that?” and “awkward as shit.”
</p>
<p>
	“Did I hear somebody say they were the coolest in town…?” a booming voice echoed through the hallway, silencing all of the students once more. This time however, they all immediately dispersed, some of them even yelling out in fear once they realized who was coming down the hallway.
</p>
<p>
	A gigantic man, possibly in his 40’s? I don’t even know man, like I said there was no maximum age for high school at this point they just kept failing you and you just kept fucking going. This guy had a full beard and a scar over one of his eyes. He wore a singlet wrestling uniform and a pair of warm-up rayon pants over whatever the fuck kinda sneakers they had at this point. Chucks, I wanna say but I’m not doing any research.
</p>
<p>
	Sherry gasped and grasped onto Mickey’s leather jacket sleeve, “It’s… it’s Bad Bad Leeroy Brown!”
</p>
<p>
	“Pfft, why should I be scared?” Mickey said, looking up into Bad Bad Leeroy Brown’s dark, heavy-lidded eyes as he stared down at him.
</p>
<p>
	“Why, he’s the baddest man in the whole damn town!” she cried out in response.
</p>
<p>
	“You’re DAMN right!” Bad Bad Leeroy Brown sneered, leaning in closer to Mickey. “And if you’re so cool, how about you and I make a little wager to see who’s the coolest… under pressure?”
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, man, cool. I’m always down to do some stupid shit to prove I’m a man.” Mickey responded casually, AND toxically.
</p>
<p>
	“ I bet you that you won’t play chicken against a car of my choice up on Dead Man’s Bluff! You drive at the cliff and the first one to chicken out loses!” Bad Bad Leeroy Brown laughed heartily in Mickey’s face, spittle raining onto his sunglasses.
</p>
<p>
	“What happens if I win?” Mickey said.
</p>
<p>
	“I’ll give you 50 bucks, which is like a million dollars in the future.” Bad Bad Leeroy Brown soothsayed, then continued, “But if you lose… I get your hot rod… AND your girl!”
</p>
<p>
	“Wait, what?” Sherry said, suddenly remembering suffrage. “I’m not a–”
</p>
<p>
	“DEAL, BABY!” Mickey cut her off, shaking the gigantic hand of the man mountain in front of him.
</p>
<p>
	“Now wait j–” Sherry started, but was instantly drowned out by the two of them trying to laugh at the other louder, back and forth, for what felt like an eternity. She just stood there the entire time.
</p>
<p>
	Later, as midnight crept through the old graveyard road that led up to Dead Man’s Bluff, our… hero? I guess? Mickey the Mack drove his shining red 1951 Hudson Pacemaker with an air of cool confidence that was only underlined by the fact he was smoking - which is super cool to do, even now.
</p>
<p>
	In the seat next to him, Sherry sat, her arms folded over her chest and her back slumped down into her seat. “Look, I know you gotta be cool and all but I just think betting me like a poker chip belies a lack of respect for me as a person!”
</p>
<p>
	“Shhh, quiet Boobs, we’re lost.” Mickey said, holding a finger up to shush her. “We’ll pull into the graveyard and ask the groundskeeper which road we need to take up here. Old Man Mortenson will know.”
</p>
<p>
	“Old Man Mortenson is an old creepy weirdo who lives in a shack in a graveyard! Almost like he’s a HERMIT or something! There, I fucking said it!” said Sherry.
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t be such a draaaag, sweetheart.” Mickey said with his trademark sly smile. He flicked his sunglasses out and slid them onto the brim of his nose as he smirked.
</p>
<p>
	“Wait, can you even see anything with those on?” Sherry asked
</p>
<p>
	“Uh, duh, of course I–”
</p>
<p>
	CLUNK. The front bumper of the Pacemaker bumped into the metal fence beside the driveway into the graveyard with a metallic rattle. Mickey threw it in reverse and back up, sliding his sunglasses off quietly, with his head turned away from her, then pulled into the graveyard.
</p>
<p>
	A small dirt trail lead from the entrance back to the groundskeepers shack at one side of the graveyard. Mickey opened the door to his car, leaned down to the road and snatched up a rock. Sherry gave him an exasperated questioning look.
</p>
<p>
	“What? I’m not gettin’ out, fuck that.” He drew back his arm and flung the rock at the shack’s front door where it hit with a resounding heavy wooden thud. Which was followed by another thud, as the shack door came crashing down inward, into the structure.
</p>
<p>
	They could now see directly into the living room area inside where a black and white TV was blaring the latest episode of I Love Lucy, and Old Man Mortenson was guffawing at the top of his lungs. He slid back in his chair and wiped a tear away from his own crusty eye, shaking his head and chuckling to himself. “Oh Lucy… truly you are the Queen of Comedy.”
</p>
<p>
	The old man then turned his head to peer out the door, his entire demeanor shifting 180 degrees to a squinty-eyed creepy old hateful man, who leapt up and ran out the now-open door over his actual door which was face-down in his living room, into the cold night air wearing only a pair of red long johns and a lumberjack hat with the flaps… you know the one I fucking mean, I don’t remember the name.
</p>
<p>
	“INTERLOPERS! You knocked my door down AND ya ruined my Lucy experience! You oughta be ASHAAAMMMEEDDD!” he waggled his finger about an inch in front of Mickey’s face, for what seemed like an insanely long time, just standing there waggling his finger. I mean like, a genuinely upsettingly long amount of time. Silently glaring.
</p>
<p>
	Mickey looked at Sherry who shrugged and then back at Old Man Mortenson, then slapped his hand away. “Look we just need directions to Dead Man’s Bluff, I got a big toxic pissing contest to get into with a 40 year old to prove my dick is bigger tha–”
</p>
<p>
	“DEAD MAN’S BLUFF?!” the old man interrupted, taken aback with wide, terrified eyes. “Ye best not be goin up there tonight… not if ye value yer very LIVES!”
</p>
<p>
	“Why is he talking like a pirate now…?” Sherry asked, but the old man continued on without missing a beat.
</p>
<p>
	“TEN YEEEAARSSS AGOOOO… on this very night.. A young man took part in a game of chicken up on Dead Man’s Bluff… and hurtled off the side of the cliff to his VERY DOOM! They called him Maniac MacPhearson (name changed due to copyright strike from the offices of Jerry Spinelli) and he lived up to it, too! They say every year since then.. On this very night… he returns to challenge anyone who is foolish enough to accept! ….on this very night…”
</p>
<p>
	“Can we… can we just get directions, please?” Mickey pleaded.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh yeh, sure, it’s the second right up ahead. It ain’t got no sign so make sure you got your brights on. Straight up after that for about a mile. Y’cant miss it.” said Old Man Mortenson.
</p>
<p>
	“Alright uh… goodbye.” said Mickey as he revved his engine and tore out a sweet ass donut directly in this dude’s front lawn and burned rubber back down the dirt road out of the graveyard. Old Man Mortenson waved after them politely.
</p>
<p>
	“.....wait, SHIT.” the old man finally screamed out a minute later.
</p>
<p>
	Later still, Mickey and Sherry pulled up to Dead Man’s Bluff in his sweet ass cherry red fuck machine, the two of them staring silently for a moment up the long, twisting road that lead up, up, up into the distance and then unceremoniously dropped at it’s end. Maybe a bridge was meant to be built here at some point, maybe this is just a really cool visual part of a story and you shouldn’t worry about the real world logistics of it and just shut the hell up and listen? Either way, it was an intimidating sight.
</p>
<p>
	“You’re not really gonna do this are you?” Sherry asked sheepishly.
</p>
<p>
	“Of course I am. I gotta prove I’m a man, and that I’m the coolest or whatever the stakes of this were.” Mickey said with another sly smile.
</p>
<p>
	A moment of silence passed.
</p>
<p>
	“You must have a really small dick, huh?” Sherry asked flatly.
</p>
<p>
	“Yep.” Mickey said, just as flatly.
</p>
<p>
	Just then, a set of high beams broke the darkness on one side of them, turning up the road behind them and coming closer. Sidling up next to Mickey’s prized red Pacemaker, like a shark slowly cresting the water, was a deluxe 1941 Ford Street Rod in pure black with chrome trim. As if on cue fog slowly rolled into the area, across the ground underneath their cars, slowly swirling and cascading over itself like a red carpet being rolled out for the cars arrival.
</p>
<p>
	It stopped and the front window slowly rolled down, revealing a teenager, of about 17, behind the wheel, who leaned out the window and gave a leering, perverse smile at Sherry before turning his eyes to Mickey.
</p>
<p>
	“You’re here to challenge me to… a game of chicken, right?” The guy behind the wheel sneered out, leaning back slightly into his seat. He was wearing an extremely out of date suit jacket with a wide collar over top of the lapels, and a sloped wide-brimmed hat down over his eyes.
</p>
<p>
	“You’re Bad Bad Leeroy Brown’s driver? HA! You look like a reject from a Halloween party! Let’s do this thing!” Mickey revved his engine, gritting his teeth in an intimidating grimace at his opponent. The Pacemaker purred like a lion under his direction.
</p>
<p>
	“Whatever you say, bub… don’t say I didn’t warn ya.” The other driver grinned wider, his face almost slipping into the uncanny, in return, sliding back into his car and placing his hands on the wheel. His Ford roared with an unearthly deep sound which shook the ground underneath them. “Your best gal can drop the flag from your car, I’m fine with it.”
</p>
<p>
	Mickey dug in his pocket and pulled out a white handkerchief that everyone at this time had for some reason and would continue to carry around with them for their entire old ass boomer lives. Disgusting. He handed it over to Sherry. “Drop this and we punch it. Get ready!” He turned his eyes straight forward and revved the engine further.
</p>
<p>
	Sherry looked at him in terror and then turned her eyes over to the car next to them. The driver had almost completely rolled his window up and blotted out of her view of him when he thrust his face back at the window at her, cackling out an inhuman laugh as the skin peeled away from his face and revealed a crushed skull beneath it glowing a disgusting pallid green.
</p>
<p>
	Sherry screamed and immediately dropped the handkerchief by accident, the sound of both cars backfiring and shooting off like rockets in the night muffling out her horrified cries.
</p>
<p>
	She turned her body to grasp at Mickey’s jacket sleeve, yanking and tugging to try to get his attention, but he threw her off angrily, grasping even harder at the wheel as he swung the wide load of the Pacemaker up the cliffside road back and forth on it’s winding path - the screeching of metal and tires filling up the once-silent night.
</p>
<p>
	She was flung back against the door, which almost gave way and partially opened under the strain of a turn and her body striking it, but she managed to grab onto it and slam it back into place, her wide, shaking eyes catching sight of the car next to them in the dim moonlight - though it was no longer needed to see it.
</p>
<p>
	The car was alight with incandescent green flames, which tore at its surface like a spaceship entering an atmosphere - yanking metal and chrome off of it and sending it spiraling away back down the trail behind them. The windows shattered, the front crumpled in on itself, but still the car continued to speed at just the same velocity as Mickey’s. And within the now-flaking shattered front window Sherry could see the hateful burning gaze of liquidizing eyeballs inside of broken bone sockets, teeth flying out of barely skinned lips, and bones breaking into themselves. The entire while, the horrific visuals flowing into her consciousness accompanied by the mad howling laugh of the very being experiencing them.
</p>
<p>
	The ghastly driver whipped his head around and screamed out words that were loud and piercing enough to be heard over the cacophony of motors and wheels, “DON’T YOU KNOW WHY THEY NAMED IT DEAD MAN’S BLUFF?!”
</p>
<p>
	The edge in front of them was coming up so fast that there wasn’t even enough time to think. Sherry latched her hands into the door handle once more and threw it outward with all of her strength, her body bashing against it and then flying out into the cold night’s air - aloft on the wind for a moment as both cars flew - side by side - over the edge of the cliff and past sight - into the endless dark void below it and beyond what could be seen.
</p>
<p>
	Sherry landed with a heavy thud on concrete, rolled only once despite the velocity she had been traveling and then lay still for a moment in the grass next to the path. She tried as hard as she could to breathe, but no breath came from her for a moment. Until a sputtering, wheezing cough escaped her lips and then another, her chest heaving from every new breath, and her hands grasping at the grass below for a grip.
</p>
<p>
	She pushed herself up and peered around in the darkness, the moon above, tinged red as it was, still light enough to see she was only about 5 feet from the edge of the cliff. She let out a loud, wheezing scream, backing away from it as frantically as she could.
</p>
<p>
	The night was silent for a moment after.
</p>
<p>
	“Hey, are you alright?” a deep voice broke the silence, Sherry whipping her head around to see… Bad Bad Leeroy Brown?
</p>
<p>
	He was standing at the edge of the trail, a beat up old Studebaker parked behind him with a scrawny little worker from the local repair shop sitting behind the wheel.
</p>
<p>
	“Th…there was… we were…” she sputtered out, looking back to the cliff edge just above her. She realized in that moment a cold, hard truth that very few people ever experience. A thought that feels like a vice grip placed on your whole world to keep it from shattering into pieces - she couldn’t ever tell anyone what had happened here. Not only was it absolutely unbelievable but she was a woman during this time period so she would definitely be diagnosed with Insane Wandering Womb Syndrome or some shit and put in a mental institution for all of time and existence.
</p>
<p>
	“Uhm… Mickey left me here. Can I… can I get a ride home…?” she asked with a small sheepish smile, tears at the edge of her eyes.
</p>
<p>
	Bad Bad Leeroy Brown and his driver exchanged glances for a moment and then he shrugged, opening up the backside door for her. “Yeah, sure. Hop in.”
</p>
<p>
	She scurried as fast as she could into the car and leaned into the backseat for any sort of comfort she could find. Bad Bad Leeroy Brown slid his coat off and handed it to her, giving her a small comforting smile as he did. She didn’t know he was such a Nice Nice Leeroy Brown after all.
</p>
<p>
	She bundled up into the coat, they all got into the car, and slowly began to pull down the hill back away from the cliff.
</p>
<p>
	“You don’t mind if we do a quick little errand before we head back, right?” Bad Bad Leeroy Brown asked, looking back over the seat at her as the driver drove around the corner toward the road out of Dead Man’s Bluff.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh… no, no… it’s fine.” she managed to hoarsly whisper, silent tears rolling down her cheeks.
</p>
<p>
	He smiled at her then chuckled, sitting back in his seat, “Yeah, shouldn’t take too long, we just gotta do this quick race with this idiot who says he’s the best driver in town. Challenged us to a game of chicken as soon as we pulled in here!”
</p>
<p>
	The End
</p>
<p>
	P.S. - This story was set in the 1950’s in case that wasn’t excruciatingly clear.
