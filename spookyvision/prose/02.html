The Burning Wife

Prompts: Portraits & Breweries

by Jeff Pennington

April Newsome had just spent the last twelve straight hours arguing with her bitch wife Erica and had gone to bed pissed the fuck off. We're talking filled with the kind of seething rage that only Al Bundy and Maude could ever share. That "pow zoom straight to the moon" anger that wouldn't fly on 2022 television but is fine for a podcast, I guess?

You see, April had inherited her late uncles run down old tenement building, the Urban Arms, about two weeks ago. It was supposed to go to her older brother Steve but grandpa had refused to allow a man who unironically loved Buckcherry to be proprietor, so it fell to her. She couldn't really picture Steve, who looked like the 80's had shit out a wet mullet and it decided to exclusively wear jorts and smoke pall malls, would attract many tenants to begin with.

Anyway, this inheritance had started an endless argument between April and Erica that lasted through getting out of their lease at the flea-infested roach motel Erica had picked out as their little love nest to begin with; lasted through the move across the city from one run-down crack-ridden shit hole to another, and even lasted two straight frigid days of living in the top apartment in the building.

The gist of the problem in Erica's mind was that April had accepted the inheritance and decided to move them into this horrible run-down half-burnt out old rat fuckery against her will. The gist of the problem from April's point of view was that Erica had never had a job in her entire godamn life and hadn't put forth a single dime in expenses for anything since they met. Erica maintained April was a pinch-penny piece of shit, April put forth that Erica was a right royal twat with a face like an old baseball glove. As said before, they had gone to bed angry that night.

In the middle of the night, April had been jolted awake by the sound of an incredibly loud thud. She blearily glanced over at the alarm clock on her side table which seared red with the time - 2:46am. She groaned and sat still for a moment, hoping beyond hope that the sound had been inside of her dream where Erica looked and acted a lot more like Elaine from Seinfeld. She didn't understand her taste either, but fuck you for questioning it.

Thud....errrrrr

The sound repeated with a slow, dragging noise following it. Suddenly April's entire demeanor changed. She slid out of bed with as little noise as possible and grabbed the baseball bat from it's resting place leaning in the corner of the room. She brandished it with white knuckle grip and stood motionless in the cold, still darkness of this apartment she suddenly felt was very alien and new. A few silent seconds passed, her breath held, the hair on her arm at attention. Erica snored, probably dreaming about catching a baseball with her leathery ass face.

THUD....errrrrrr....

It was coming from above her. The attic. The noise sent electricity through her muscles and she was moving before she even thought about the wisdom in it. She was through the door and standing in the hallway before she had even breathed again. The pull string to the attic stairs was slowly swaying before she had even laid eyes on it.

She gritted her teeth, held even tighter to the bat in her hand, and yanked the stairs down, the creaky old wood slamming into the floorboards with a crash loud enough for every empty apartment in the building to echo it back. Erica rolled over inside the apartment and snorted a weary "sh th fuck up, April bitch..."

April didn't hear it as she bounded up the stairs and fumbled as hard as she could for the light switch on the wall next to the trapdoor. Her hand slapped wood several times before finally finding the old turn of the century push-button light switch. A single bulb dangling in the middle of the wide attic room slowly whirred to life, audible against the only sound in the night - April's shallow breaths.

But she wasn't met with a scary clown, a masturbating/ murderous old creeper, or even one of those scary ass Chucky Dolls that want to fuck you for some reason. Instead, sitting in the center of the attic, propped up against some old chairs and bins, was a gigantic, life-like oil painting in an elaborate gold frame. She squinted against the yellowy light of the bulb that hung above it, making out the face of an old, heavy set aristocratic woman with a white-blonde quaff and a pure white evening gown. The old woman in the painting glowered at her, her face twisted into a disapproving stare.

April looked around the rest of the room, the sudden shock back to reality of the light and the creepy old painting reminding her she was a small, unathletic person in her pajamas holding a baseball bat she hadn't swung since middle school and even then the rest of the team called her "Skidmark Poosome" and wouldn't let her play anything but outfield. She quickly turned the light off and rushed back down the stairs, slamming the trapdoor shut behind her and turning the locking mechanism. As she stood in the dark, breathing heavily, and trying to think of what to do next she couldn't help but smell something burning on the air. The faint scent of wood smoldering.

The next day, April had decided to call the cops. She had sat up all night long debating on it but there was definitely someone, or some kind of animal or something, in the attic of the building. The cops laughed in response to her claim.

"Look lady, we've all heard the story of the Urban Arms, you're not the first one to try pulling this on us." the officer had said on the phone, setting us up for valuable exposition while also upholding the ACAB rule. "Next time why don't you call us about some werewolves or global warming or something else fake that's at least original." he sneered fuckily, being a little bitch boy about it.

"What?" April asked, stunned to be being treated this way while being a white woman. "I don't know what you're talking about. What story?"

"Goodbye and don't call here with this shit again." The fuckhole cop hung up and probably pissed his pants because cops, am I right?

April hung up the phone and stood there for a moment before noticing the stack of mail on the table next to the phone. One piece was sticking out from it, and the matte gray text gave her an idea for someone else to go to for help.

Later that day there was a ring at the front door, far earlier in the day than April had expected anyone to show up. She swung open the door and found herself face to face with a middle aged man who looked like life had bitchslapped him on every birthday. He held his hand out to her and she recoiled instantly.

"Uh, I don't have any change. Since when do you people ring doorbells for this? There's gotta be a city ordinance or--"

He interrupted her, "I'm uh Pavlov Flinch. The private eye? We spoke on the uh.. the phone." He spoke at a leisurely pace, unperturbed by the look of disgust in April's eyes at the look, smell, and sound of him. Hell, even his aura was repellant somehow.

He was short, with sunken features and a five o-clock shadow that was less rugged and more of a red flag. He was wearing what could only be described as Scruff McGruff cosplay without the giant foam mascot head. An old timey gray trench coat, a brown suit two sizes too big, yellow undershirt and keyboard tie. He looked like the late 70's had grown legs and receded hair.

"Oh yes..." April said with a hand to her temple, a headache coming on. She glanced at her watch then looked back up at him "It's 10:30. You're three and a half hours early."

"Oh yeah yeah. My mom has bingo at 2 so I can only use her car until then or I'll get in trouble. This'll be wrapped up before then, yeah?" he responded plainly, as if this wasn't wild as fuck for an adult man to be saying. He kept fidgeting in place, looking up and down the street.

"Are you ok?" April finally asked, frustrated and impatient with this man almost immediately. Also the cloud of gin fumes around him.

"Last time I was around here I got beat up by some neighborhood kids over the Pokemon Trading Card Game." he muttered while still looking around warily. "I used the shiny Machoke that comes with the starter kit and they called me a noob and took turns kicking me. Mostly in the dick but also in the kidneys some. They pelted me with McDonalds chicken nuggets and ran off." he paused thoughtfully, "I ate really well that night, though..."

"Mr. Flinch I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, can we just get on with this?!" April blurted out, her frustration thankfully masking the deep, deep regret at having hired a private investigator from the back of a local Lawn Company Flyer.

"Oh yeah, sure." Flinch pushed past her into the building without even waiting for the go-ahead, stopping in the foyer and peering around with his beady eyes. He reminded April of a rat if it was human but only kind of human. She already hated this man.

"Like I said on the phone... I think there's some kind of itinerant hiding in my attic. My wife and I hear him banging around up there at all hours of the night."

He paused for a moment before glancing back to me. "Oh you're one of those Glads."

"Gay." she corrected.

"Gay." he repeated, in a tone that sounded like someone had reminded him of some obscure ALF trivia and not a fact of existence involving a sizable portion of the population. "Can I see the attic?"

After Flinch took several breaks to not-so-sneakily gulp down quick nips of his hip flask on the stairs April had led him up into the attic through the pull-string trap door. He gave the room a cursory glance. "Looks like an attic." he said with some kind of pride in himself. April winced, realizing she had already Venmo'd this idiot $100.

"PLEASE tell me you've got something else to say about this. " she said through gritted teeth.

"Yeah, well... you really don't know what Pokemon i-- alright uhhh.." he looked around with a fed up exasperation he had not earned in the slightest before shrugging and pointing across the room. "What's with your big blank canvas? You a painter?"

"Blank?" April turned to look in the direction that he was pointing and surely as he saw there was the gigantic overly ornate gold frame from last night ...but inside of it wasn't a portrait of a snarling old bitty - it was nothing but utterly blank white. Not a speck of paint on it. As a matter of fact, a good portion of the surface had begun to rot due to old age and disuse. She gawked, empty-minded, dread rising in her gut, before finally sputtering back to reality, "Wait, no.. no, that was COMPLETELY painted earlier! A big fat woman with a nasty look!"

"Whoa, whoa, let's not bring weight into this, that's body shaming...." Flinch chastised, but April was hardly paying attention as he prattled on. "Look are you sure you don't want me to just take photos of your wife fuckin' somebody behind you back? That's what I usually get paid for. I swear I don't do nothin' unsavory with 'em, I got the internet back at home. Well, at somebody's home..."

April placed her hand flat against the surface. The feel of rough canvas, unwoven by time and age, almost like burlap, met her touch. She shook her head. "The... the person up here must have done something... there really is someone in here, then, oh my god." She backed toward the stairs, arms crossed and shaking.

"Oh don't worry, you know I keep that thaaaaanggg on me." Flinch opened his overcoat to reveal a shoulder mounted holster with the remains of an unwrapped, half-melted Choco Taco dangling from inside. "Oh shit..." he muttered, patting his hands over his pockets and peering into the other side of his coat. "I must've left it in my mom's car, I'll be right back."

April barely noticed Flinch duck down the stairs and disappear around the corner, but she did notice the stairs swing up and slam shut, HARD against the floorboards she stood on. She jumped at the sound, and immediately dropped to the floor, pushing as hard as she could against the old wood, but it didn't even budge.

It took her longer than it would normally to notice because she was pushing and pulling against the stair's trap door but eventually it did hit her. The smell of coals smoldering. Wood touched by fire. She raised her eyes slowly toward the painting in the center of the room. The white in it's center slowly turned outward, deformed and bedraggled by flames. It sputtered at first, the fire that grew from within the painting, but it moved so quickly once it caught. It's bright orange edge left behind a black soot upon the canvas but it didn't stay still. It formed an image beneath the licking flames, of a heavy set woman, in a soot-stained white gown, her hair gone, singed away at the root, her skin molted and black, scarred beyond all recognition.. except that look. That scowling, vicious stare. Even with teeth exposed by lips burned to ash, the scowl bore it's way into April's mind.

She screamed, loud and strong, beating her fists against the wood harder and harder, filling her skin with wood shrapnel as blood stained the grain. But it did not move. The fire moved, however. Before April could even scream again the flames had enveloped the entire room, metal screaming from the heat alongside her, wood alighting, plastic melting, all surrounding the horrific visage of the woman in the painting. The flames reached as long, curling, twisting fingers toward April.

And they enveloped her as well. And she too, burned, and twisted, and melted away all the while screaming.

Pavlov Flinch sat four buildings down in O'Paddy O'Rielly McGillicutties Brewery and Bar, on his second scotch on the rocks, probably his eighth drink of the day. No one judged him for it because it was an Irish bar and you know how THOSE TYPES are. Am I right?

"You're on  job at the Urban Arms...?" the bartender asked, leaning over the counter with both elbows.

"Why yes, I am. I'm a private detective y'know." Flinch responded, gulping another swig down his gullet. "I don't even have to take photos of people fucking this time if I don't want to."

The bartender stood up straight, confused by that statement, but undaunted. "Well uh... you don't know the story about the Urban Arms?"

Flinch shook his head.

"It was built by some oil tycoon for his wife, who was some kind of heiress herself or something. It was supposed to be a mansion house. Must've been a pretty beautiful place in it's day."

Pavlov nodded, not wanting to interrupt the exposition dump.

"The wife found out the husband had been cheating on her for years with her own sister. She waited until one day both of them were in the house. Burned them both alive in it. Drug the woman kicking and screaming across the attic floor. The craziest part is they say she just stood in the attic window watching the whole place burn to the ground. Fuckin' crazy, man. Bitches, am I right?"

Flinch stared a moment, before shaking his head and slamming his glass down. "I-I haven't gotten fully paid yet, I need to-"

The sound of a siren wailing past and tires screeching to a stop down the street ended his sentence before liver failure could. Next time! His liver thought.

Flinch ran out into the road along with the bartender and several other patrons of the brewery. They stood transfixed on the Urban Arms down the street. Englufed from cornerstone to roofing tile with seering bright flame. The firefighters worked valiantly, firing gallons of water into the building, but it was if the fire couldn't even be touched by it. It just raged on, and on, and on.

And the onlookers on the street that day all say the same thing. They all watched the building burn to nothing but ash and cinders for the second time in it's life that day. In less than an hour nothing was left but the foundation and the floorboards. But during the entire ordeal, as firemen screamed orders, and people stood and stared in horror and awe, in the top window of the building, standing stock still, was a woman in a long white gown, with a vicious sneer upon her lips.

Erica was fuckin wilin' out when she got back from hot yoga, too. God damn.
