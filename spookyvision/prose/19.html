	The Creature from the Hudson Bay
</p>
<p>
	A Frankenstein P.I. Mystery
</p>
<p>
	By Jeff Pennington

<p>
	Prompts: Ships & Zoos
</p>
<p>
	From the Case Files of Adam Frankenstein, Private Investigator.
</p>
<p>
	New York, New York, Fall 1934. Entries 5 and 6.
</p>
<p>
	Entry 5: Last week I got a call from a 9-to-5 working stiff from the suburbs frantically saying he required my services. I ask him what’s the job, what’s the problem, y’know my normal game of twenty questions and he’s outright bamboozled. Has no clue what the hell I’m talkin about but that I should come to 123 Slowly Dying Every Day of My Life Avenue, Suburbia, some kind of really plain street name in the suburbs like that - and step on the gas about it.
</p>
<p>
	Now I had to change trains twice and catch a cab to get out there so I’m thinking there better be a big payday waiting for me at the end of the line, right? Wrong. This mayonnaise sandwich in a beige dress shirt tells me it’s his kid’s birthday party and he’s a big fan of the movie Frankenstein - the Universal Picture AND the original book - so he HAD to hire me for his big 11th birthday party. Said I was the only Big Frank impersonator they could find in the book!
</p>
<p>
	I was fuckin mortified - moreso than usual even which is saying something considering I’ve been every type of mortis including rigor. Pfft. …Aaanyway, the birthday cake was pretty good and I made 50 bucks so I can’t complain too much about it, I guess. Didn’t even fling any little girls to their tragic untimely deaths into lakes… this time.
</p>
<p>
	Entry 6: Ever since I woke up in some weirdo science perverts basement I’ve been spending most of my time trying to stay busy enough not to dwell on the questions that haunted my very existence back in my old life.
</p>
<p>
	That question being: What is it that defines a person’s humanity? What is that ineffable essence - that touch of the grace of God beyond the conscious - that makes someone fully human? Am I inherently lacking this conceit because of my birth by the hands of an ungodly man? It would be ironic not to be human - considering I’m jam packed full of the parts to make one like a giant bag of Party Size Chex Mix - but there is something that will always separate me, fundamentally, from everyone and everything around me. I am no masterpiece nor fluke of nature - I am an abomination cobbled together by the fevered hateful clockwork mind of a madman in the throes of delirium.
</p>
<p>
	I promise this self-indulgent trip through my happy childhood memories will be relevant to this case later, just tuck yourself in and stick around. I end up fistfighting some kinda disgusting hell creature by the end of this one like usual, so it’ll be worth it.
</p>
<p>
	I used to be a man fearful of God but desirous all the same for his existence. Because if an almighty could exist - a power beyond that of Dr. Victor Frankenstein that birthed me into an endless tortuous hell - perhaps that being of infinite grace and love could lift me up out of my baneful existence and provide me the salvation that he so graciously appoints unto those who offer him their piety and penance. Unfortunately freezing to death in the Arctic Ocean then being unthawed in a basement in Brooklyn hundreds of years later tends to drain the religion right out of you - also the piss. You wouldn’t BELIEVE how much I pissed once I got done rampaging for a couple minutes. Coulda refilled the Grand Canyon and then some - and I’m the type of guy who doesn’t hit the bathroom too often - considering I’m a corpse and all. More often than the average corpse, though.
</p>
<p>
	I got kinda sidetracked there, I think. Let me just get to the actual fuckin case and we’ll swing back to how this fits in later.
</p>
<p>
	It was Friday night and I was about to close up shop to head off to McClintock’s Bar to spend the weekend vacationing at the bottom of a bottle like always when there was a knock at my office door. Normally I’d have turned the lamp off and pretended to not be home to avoid it but something felt different about this one - the soft tapping of high heels on the other side.
</p>
<p>
	“Door’s open!” I yelled out, sitting back in my chair and rubbing at the bridge of my nose. The stitches there throbbed with the headache between my eyes - the rhythm not quite matching the heels rapping across the floor as she entered.
</p>
<p>
	She was a woman in her late 30’s with blondish brown hair and a small squirrely nose tucked between two oversized glasses lenses. There was a serene beauty to her outwardly but the slight quivering in her lip and the shifting gaze gave away a deeper insecurity below. It could be because she was suddenly confronted with a stack of human body-parts hurried slapdashed together like a Lego Star Wars set made by a 5 year old but to me it read like an older, more personal kind of fear.
</p>
<p>
	“H…Hello, Mr. Frankenstein. You’re available for short term detective work, right?” she said as she pushed the door mostly closed behind her with a careless nudge. She was dressed more matronly than her age suggested, with a puffy shouldered dress that should have belonged to a much older woman, and a pair of buckled heels that seemed to be for someone much younger.
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, I am. Well… depends on what exactly you’re looking for me to do. I don’t do kids parties… anymore.” I reached into the top drawer of my desk and retrieved the pack of Lucky Strikes inside, patting a couple cigarettes out and holding it out to her in offering.
</p>
<p>
	She declined with a wave of her hand, taking a seat unprompted on one of the chairs situated in front of my desk haphazardly. I kicked myself for my lack of decorum but soothed my burned ego with the knowledge I was a horror movie monster in a tie and we’re all just doing the best we can out here.
</p>
<p>
	“You see…” she cleared her throat and pulled her small black purse tighter to her stomach. “My… boyfriend. My boyfriend has been kidnapped. And the police haven’t been able to find anything out about by who or for what reason. No one’s even asked for a ransom so the police keep telling me he just ran off with a younger woman or something. But they’re wrong, he’d never do that!”
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, ACAB, tell me about it.” I said plainly, tucking a lucky strike between my lips and striking a match up.
</p>
<p>
	“...what?” the woman asked, leaning forward in her seat slightly.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh uh… nothing, that.. Uh.. doesn’t mean anything yet.” I said, cryptically, to both the audience and the character in this story. “Do please continue.” I puffed my cigarette to life with the match to its end then shook out the flame.
</p>
<p>
	“Well, he’s been missing for… well for about a…week now.” She spoke in an unsteady cadence, her eyes darting around the room every so often behind her thick-rimmed glasses.
</p>
<p>
	“Uh-huh.” I said flatly, peering at her from behind the smoke raising from my mouth.
</p>
<p>
	“And… well he… he has a job at the docks. And… I imagine he went missing there. He goes there every night. For the night shift. He.. loads ships.” She smiled a weak, weary smile at me.
</p>
<p>
	I grimaced back at her silently.
</p>
<p>
	“Well… what else do you need to know? He works at… at Quarterman’s Docks, on the south end. You should start looking there.” She seemed to be getting a little frustrated, and I was well aware of the feeling.
</p>
<p>
	“Miss…” I started, sliding my chair back away from the desk and folding my hands over my stomach as I leaned back. “You have come to me to help find your missing boyfriend, correct? A man whom you love - and wish to have returned to you as soon as possible. Am I following so far?”
</p>
<p>
	“Well yes, of course.” She sat up straighter in her chair, made uncomfortable by my nonchalance. I love making people uncomfortable, as we’ve gone over before in these little entires. I’m a bastard and a monster, you’ll forgive me.
</p>
<p>
	“Well perhaps you can explain to me why you haven’t told me your name, his name, or any shred of actual, truthful information besides a single location since you entered into my establishment?” I sat up straight and blew smoke across the table in her direction. We were just too far apart for it to really hit her in the face, which was lame, but she did cough immediately, which was pretty dope.
</p>
<p>
	She covered her mouth and grimaced back at me from behind her hand. That look seemed like the first honest thing she’d done since she walked through the door. “Look, I’m paying you money to find my boyfriend for me, how about you shut your nasty deadlipped hole and do your job?” she snapped, and hard.
</p>
<p>
	For my part, I laughed. She didn’t like that much either, but the embarrassment of having shot her mouth off hit her like a freight train nonetheless. She delved into her purse and returned with a handkerchief, dabbing her face with it.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m… I’m sorry, Mr. Frankenstein. You must understand that I’ve come to you purposefully. You handle cases where information needn’t be given so… heavily. That’s your reputation at any rate.”
</p>
<p>
	“Sure, that’s true enough. You don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to be spread around. But you are gonna have to give me a name to call you, and a name to call him. Not to mention a description of the guy. Vague or not. Then I can start snooping around the shipyard seeing where he’s gotten himself lost at.” I tapped the desk with two fingers and let the smoke swirl from my cigarette for a minute after.
</p>
<p>
	“...Fine.” she returned after a moment of thought. She reached into her purse and pulled out a small roll of bills, held together with a frayed old rubber band. Not the kind of neat roll of cash that a criminal would carry around, more the kind of life’s saving a recluse would keep tucked under their mattress in case the lizard aliens in control of the Government take over the banks. “My name is Kay Lawrence. I’m a heiress… of a not very substantial fortune or manor, I’m afraid. My father left me the third floor of an apartment building in Manhattan that hadn’t been kept up in a decade and enough cash to live on until I found myself a husband or died a spinster - he didn’t care which.”
</p>
<p>
	“That’s fathers for ya.” I chimed in, tapping my right hand fingers across my lefts knuckles rhythmically. She didn’t notice if I was giving off the vibe of not giving a fuck about the backstory and continued, even though I think I was REALLY putting it out there.
</p>
<p>
	“I met my boyfriend, Gill, down by the docks when I was on a walk and we instantly just had this… connection. He was so gentle and kind and unlike every brute of a man I’d ever met in my life before.” She took a moment to give me a side-eye that burned right through me. May as well have been a laser in one of those science fiction pictures for the hole it bore through. Little bitch. She continued, “It was only a scant few weeks before he’d moved into my apartment in Manhattan. He split his time between there and his work at the docks ever since. Until he didn’t return home.”
</p>
<p>
	“Well you didn’t go to the police for a reason. I’ll leave that to your secrets pile.” When I mumbled that out her eyes went wide and then hardened all at once at me. She didn’t find my playful attitude as charming as some women do. I assume some must, somewhere. “So when did he actually disappear? You’re worried so I figure it’s weird for him to be gone for this long, regardless.”
</p>
<p>
	“Well…” she started, her fingers nervously fiddling with the little black strap of her purse. She sat silently for a few moments, her eyes darting to me and then back to the desk between us. Finally, she spoke up in a small, choked voice. “Today. He was supposed to be home at 5, but it’s 11 now. He’s never even been a second late before. We’ve been together for five years. He’s never even been one second late in that time.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’ll take it.” I stopped myself abruptly, holding a hand up in the air for emphasis even. The thought hit me like a brick and brought a smile to my jagged, mish-mash of a mug. “Full payment up front and expenses.”
</p>
<p>
	Her jaw dropped. I grinned even wider.
</p>
<p>
	—------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	The salty balmy air of the Hudson Bay is enough to bring a tear to the eye of any New Yorker but to be honest I’ve always got some kinda gunk in there anyway. Like a pet cat. It’s annoying as fuck and doesn’t do me any favors visually - and I need all I can get.
</p>
<p>
	This time though, the Hudson was just spritzing the smell of fish into the air like a Glade plug-in from hell and I couldn’t help but have trouble tuning it out as I moved as quietly as I could toward the stall owned by Quarterman’s Docking Service - the purported workplace of the ever-mysterious “Gill”, boyfriend of “Totally von Realname, actual heiress.”
</p>
<p>
	It wasn’t hard not to stir up too much attention since it was heading toward midnight at this point and the dock was clear of anyone with a heartbeat at the moment. Just the sound of the water lapping at the ancient wood of the dock and the nightbirds yammering away in their little bitch language at each other. Morons.
</p>
<p>
	Quarterman’s stall was locked up tight so I figured it was about time to use the ol’ five finger front door key and just smash my way in when a flickering light in the distance caught my eye. On the other side of the fencing set up behind the stall down to the lower docks there was a cargo ship slowly bobbing up and down on the waves, moored in and roped to the upper docks. Across the right side of the ship was emblazoned the gigantic red logo of something called The Dusk Corporation. And on the deck of that ship was a small light dipping behind and around things, disappearing and flickering for a moment when out of sight.
</p>
<p>
	I ducked down in front of the stall and peered around its edges. I’ve always been a kin to the dark but even with the distant overhanging lamps I couldn’t make out what was happening on board the cargo ship.
</p>
<p>
	I pressed my back against the stall’s front and thought for a moment. The client had told me that her boyfriend worked the night shift at the dock but there isn’t any god damn night shift at the dock, is there? That’s absolutely ludicrous.
</p>
<p>
	As if fate itself was answering my question - or the writer thought this would be a funny thing to just happen to save some fucking page count since we’re already on 6, my eye caught a small sign underneath where the clerk would be standing, which read “Hours of Operation, 5am to 5pm, Monday thru Saturday.” That was some good writing, Jeff. You deserve a quick bathroom break for that one! …ok, now back at it!
</p>
<p>
	Figuring what’s the worst that could happen - I get thrown overboard into freezing waters and die? - I decided it was time to get on that ship. I wrenched the gate off its hinges as quietly as I could manage and started down the dock toward the boat.
</p>
<p>
	It was about then I heard the unmistakable jangling of extremely heavy chains heading in my direction fast. I looked to my side just in time to see a boat anchor swing through the air from the side of the cargo ship straight toward my face and…
</p>
<p>
	—-------------------
</p>
<p>
	Then I woke up.
</p>
<p>
	It took me a lot of squinting in the dark and peering and other optical verbs before I realized I was in an old rusty crab diving cage that was sealed shut with a padlock. I felt like an albino King Kong with a skin condition in that thing, and I had a hell of a headache where an anchor had come outta nowhere and walloped me, but I was alive at least. Or a reasonable facsimile.
</p>
<p>
	There were ropes strewn about in the darkness, gigantic wooden crates everywhere piled up around me, and even a few visible dim port holes up above my head, so it was safe to say I was in the god damn boat now. That’s where I was going anyway, but this somehow didn’t feel like the right way to do it.
</p>
<p>
	What really caught my attention though was another big crab diving cage across the way from mine, caddy-cornered in the opposite direction. It even had a matching old padlock keeping it shut. But inside wasn’t a patchwork man rethinking his entire career path who really needed a drink and at LEAST some pretzels, no this was something different altogether - and I mean that in every way you could imagine.
</p>
<p>
	Snarling in a low, gutteral voice was a hunched humanoid figure, cramped into the back of the cage as far away from me as it could get. Even in that dim light I could see the moonlight from the portholes reflecting off of it’s slimy, luminescent skin - green and blue and yellow in turn, one fading into the other at different points on its body - and this thing was butt ass booty buck naked too, but not in any way I was personally interested in at the time.
</p>
<p>
	Strange jutting flaps of flesh raised off of it and slid back toward his body in succession at the leg and the arm, and even along the top and back of its head - fins. The thing’s face solidified my hunch at the look of it - with thick fish features that were pulled back into a humanoid countenance - save for the pure black bulbous eyes that started where a man’s would rest on its features and continued around the side of its face a ways - this was a fucking fish man. Holy fucking shit. I’d seen a lot of wild shit in my day, but trust me when I tell you a fucking mermaid wasn’t on my list of real shit I was gonna share a boat jail with any time soon. Fuckin’ wild out here these days, man.
</p>
<p>
	Then it suddenly hit me like a freight train accidentally hits a cop who gives up his partner for bad behavior - the lady who hired me called her boyfriend “Gill.” The lady who hired me had sent me to retrieve this fucking FISH MAN from this boat - her god damn BOYFRIEND - because she knew he would be here if he’d gone missing.
</p>
<p>
	This mousey little bitch was FUCKING A FISH. I suddenly didn’t need the pretzels anymore and needed WAY more of the liquor. The fishy smell in the air was really sending the visuals of it all through my head and I was suddenly really glad I didn’t seem to be able to throw up. There wasn’t a whole lot of room in the cage.
</p>
<p>
	“Uh… Gill?” I asked tentatively, the sound of my own voice sending a sharp pain through my gaping head wound. Turns out my headache was a little worse than I’d imagined, but it plays a pretty small role in the story from here on out, shockingly.
</p>
<p>
	The thing snorted at me and I swear there was a hint of confusion in the sound. You and me both, motherfucker, you and me both.
</p>
<p>
	I decided a better use of my limited time was to get myself out of this cell before whoever had bonked my noggin decided to show up and reenact it. The padlock was old enough that I could palm it and just yank it off like a working stiffy which I was capable of having whenever I wanted.
</p>
<p>
	The twisted metal lock clattered to the ground and the fish who fucked human women in the cage across from mine didn’t even seem to register it. Seemed impressive enough to me, but whatever.
</p>
<p>
	“Look, we’re bustin’ out of here. Don’t give me any lip, save that for your freaky deaky ass girlfriend.” I pushed out of my own cage and walked over to his. He was still coiled up in the back corner, staring at me with his big, empty black eyes. I was honestly beginning to wonder if this lady was banging like a regular fish. Just like a big man-shaped fish with the intelligence of a normal fish.
</p>
<p>
	That really brought up a lot of moral questions that may have distracted me as I ripped the padlock off of his cage cause this slimy bastard shot out at me like a nasty wet bullet and dug some of the gnarliest claws I’ve ever seen into my chest.
</p>
<p>
	I let out a scream and bashed him over and over with the cage door, trying to use it to swat him off of me, but he reared back and sank his jagged ass teeth into my neck. I know people date British folks all the time but how in the fuck are you gonna date something with THIS level of fucked up dental care I have no clue.
</p>
<p>
	I got a little fed up at this point and gripped onto the guy with both hands, peeling him off of me like a fruit by the foot off the wrapper on a 90 degree day - with a ton of resistance - but he wasn’t nearly as strong as I was so off he came.
</p>
<p>
	At this point I didn’t honestly know what to do with him - one one hand I said I’d get him back to his fish horny gf for whatever nasty sushi they were gonna have together but on the other hand I was hurting and I’ve legendarily not got the sweetest disposition, so I did what any blue-blooded corpse man with a small business to run would do - I started wailing on the stinky bastard.
</p>
<p>
	I held him with one hand and just started bashing him in the face over and over again until he stopped moving and hung limp from my hand. When the red hot rage settled back down into my stomach I surveyed what my fists had wrought and..
</p>
<p>
	“Oh shit… this isn’t… I’m sorry, fella, look… you were kind of a prick so…” I fumbled over my words, letting the limp body of the merman drop onto the floor and lay still there. I had made the mother of all whoopsies, and I wasn’t looking forward to trying to explain it to the client.
</p>
<p>
	My panic didn’t last too long though, as the double doors at the end of the cargo bay flung open, and six guys piled, one of them in the front even holding an automatic machine pistol. Each one of these angry men was more jauntily outfitted than the last, decked out in white captains hat and seaman’s turtleneck sweaters and shit - it was jaunty as FUCK, boys. It would’ve been pretty whimsical if the leader didn’t start immediately opening fire.
</p>
<p>
	Bullets ate through the wood of the cargo boxes surrounding me, sending splinters and shards flying into the air like confetti, but somehow I managed to tuck and roll behind one fast enough to avoid being swiss cheesed by Popeye the Sailor Man. Bullets flew for a couple more seconds before a husky voice rang out from the other side of the room.
</p>
<p>
	“Get back in your cage and we won’t pump you full of bullets and dump you overboard for the sharks!”
</p>
<p>
	“Hah hah yeah! The oooool’ pump and dump, right boss?” a higher pitched voice chimed in.
</p>
<p>
	There was the sound of a backhand slap and then silence for a second, then the first voice piped up again, “You’re goin’ to the boss’ island as his special guest! No need to worry so much, he always takes care of all the freaks in his zoo!”
</p>
<p>
	“What?” I yelled back to him, taking care not to let my incredulousness make me pop my head out for target practice. “Zoo?!”
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah ya big nasty freako! The boss keeps a zoo of weirdo freaks on his private island so he can experiment on ‘em and have all kindsa fun! Hehehehe!” The higher pitched voice chimed back in, cackling like a little sex weirdo at the idea of experimentation.
</p>
<p>
	There was another sound of a slap, accompanied this time by the higher voice apologizing in a whisper. The huskier voice continued, “None of that matters. Either get back in the cage or we fucking kill you and it doesn’t matter either way!”
</p>
<p>
	I reached for the pistol in my shoulder holster and of course it was gone. I had assumed by how cartoonishly stupid these thugs seemed that maybe they had left it by accident, but no go. That was such an expensive gun too…
</p>
<p>
	My lamentations for my wallet didn’t last long though - they were interrupted by a screeching inhuman sound on the other side of the box I was hiding behind. I couldn’t help it this time, I peered around the side of the box, just in time to see the fish man ripping the throat out of the guy with the machine pistol with his jagged teeth. The machine pistol fired off into the air as the jauntily dressed man’s body spasmed and shook, killing one of the other men who had come in with them with a spray of bullets.
</p>
<p>
	The remaining four men screamed bloody murder and began to run away, but the apparently-fuckable-fish-man wasn’t having any of it. He was on them like fish stick on his girlfriend, slashing around his fin claws and gnashing with his teeth.
</p>
<p>
	I for one took the opportunity to vault over the box and slide across the floor to the edge of the brouhaha - just close enough to scoop the machine pistol up off the floor. It was pretty easy to hit a target with this thing - so my bad aim be damned. I’d cut down the remaining three guys within an instant and was aiming for the fourth when he fell to the ground in a blood mess before the tearing blades coming out of every orifice of this fish freak.
</p>
<p>
	Instead, I leveled the gun at him, tilting my head and peering at him with purpose. “Uh uh uh. Let’s not get hasty here, Fish Sticks. Neither of us is trying to Titanic 2 here. Let’s talk this out like reasonable children’s nightmares.”
</p>
<p>
	The fish man took heaving breaths, rasping in the air as if he couldn’t get anything into his lungs. It didn’t take a genius to know what was going on, but the slits along his neck rasping air in and out like coughing could’ve taught the village idiot.
</p>
<p>
	I walked over to one of the high port windows and undid the sealing bolt on it and swung it open. It was plenty big enough for two men to slip out of and this guy was pretty damn thin for having the kind of attack power he did. I assume his dad was a Marlin or a Swordfish or something. And his mom was a stone cold fucking sex freak.
</p>
<p>
	I motioned with the machine pistol for the window and he immediately ran full tilt and leapt out of it. The splash was barely audible below but it was there and it was time for me to make a retreat as well.
</p>
<p>
	By the time I made it topside and back down to the dock off the ship, he was pulling himself back up out of the water onto the dock as well, and he eyed me warily, his dark lidless eyes surveying into my very soul.
</p>
<p>
	“You understood… that I’m no beast.” the voice that came out of this thing shook me to my core. He sounded like an English professor at a Community College - the level of meekness and softness just didn’t befit a guy who just got done chewing someones vocal chords out of their neck.
</p>
<p>
	“Uh… yeah. Your uh… your girlfriend sent me to find you. I’m a private eye.” I managed to stumble out, tucking the end of the machine pistol awkward into the shoulder harness for my 357 magnum. It suddenly dawned on me I was gonna have to go back on the boat and search for that… did I have time before cops showed up to pretend they do anything for a living?
</p>
<p>
	“Ah… Kay sent you….” He whispered, his meek collegiate voice really sounding off as he wiped away the last of a bit of blood that had remained on his chin. “I am sorry… I did not recognize the humanity within you as well.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh… well…” I trailed off for a moment, trying not to let the old question reawaken, and failing as they began to burn in my chest again. I smiled as best I could and did what I always did, joke it away, “Probably all the corpse parts getting in the way, eh?”
</p>
<p>
	The fish man studied me with his glass-like black eyes, reflecting onto me a coldness that I couldn’t tell where originated. From his gaze or from within the reflection of my own eyes within his. He simply repeated himself after a moment, “I am sorry.” though it seemed he was sorry about something deeper than skin this time.
</p>
<p>
	—----------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	I retrieved my gun and returned to my office with “Gill”, who never told me what his real name happened to be, or if he even actually had one. We didn’t swap origin stories, or even talk much at all to be honest. We walked many blocks in silence, and shared one of the most awkward taxi rides of my entire life. Not only for the two of us but especially for the driver. I tipped him pretty well, I think.
</p>
<p>
	Ms. Lawrence, my client, was overjoyed at the return of her fish boyfriend, and I made certain not to look anyway close to them when they kissed, but I’ll share with you straight up it was the most disgusting sound I’ve ever heard in my life and I’ve fought a mummy, zombies, and all kindsa other shit I haven’t even written in this ledger yet. Shit was NASTY.
</p>
<p>
	I got paid up front, didn’t lose my gun, got reimbursed for my cab ride, and even got a bonus for the safe return of Gill - overall this was my most profitable case yet by a longshot. Was this the only case where I got paid so far? Fuck man, I hope not.
</p>
<p>
	I think the moral of this one is that you can’t run away from yourself forever. Those questions at the very core of who you are and what you want out of this life will always burn inside of you and there may never come an answer for them. But if a freak like Gill can find true love with a woman like Kay who will do whatever it takes to find him and get him home with that kind of fervor after six hours missing? Then maybe there’s hope for freaks like me as well.
</p>
<p>
	I also learned what a ‘fetish’ is. Yucko.
</p>
<p>
	Case Closed.
</p>
