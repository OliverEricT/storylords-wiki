	The sound of bike tires against asphalt filled the night’s air as the three pre-teens pedaled hard against the steep incline of the backwoods road into the next town over. They came from a sleepy little town in the middle of nowhere called Kirby, so it took them hours to bike all the way down the road to their destination but they could finally see it coming up over the horizon once they crested the hill.
</p>
<p>
	“There! I told you!” yelled the young boy in front, his shaggy blonde hair flying in the wind from the edges of the Huskies hat atop his head. His name was Archie Grace and he was the captain of the baseball team at school, something he was proud enough of to still be dressed in his practice uniform from earlier in the evening, a baseball bat dangling out of his backpack like a sheathed sword. He was the sort of all-american honkey that parents dreamed of raising because he spent every waking moment of his life trying to please them and live to their idea of a son. If he made it to 21 he would need either an assload of therapy or his own son would need it one day. Eventually somebody had to escape this shit, right? He pointed out toward the town, steering his bike with one hand as his windbreaker flapped behind him. “The entire town is completely dark! It’s dead!”
</p>
<p>
	“Maybe they all just go to bed early!” yelled the second kid, Becka Washington, on the next bike behind. She was a tall little girl for her age with afro pigtails bobbing with her pedaling motions and one hand gripping onto her glasses to keep them from sliding off her face. She wore a band majorette’s jacket over her regular clothes and its rough, scratchy material barely moved in the breeze. She was the type of girl who non-band geeks would label a capital L loser freak but who would grow up to become rich and famous for her talent and legally be allowed to kill her haters. That’s how it worked with Taylor Swift, right? “It’s probably like 9 already!” she followed up.
</p>
<p>
	“FUUUUCK YEAAAAHH!!” screamed ‘Wild’ Willie Coltrane, the craziest kid in the 7th grade. He was wearing a full Evel Kineival costume, like complete with helmet, visor, and sleeve fringe, and everything. He basically wore this outfit 24/7 so you can imagine that these were the only two friends he was ever going to have. He was riding a bike with streamers dangling from its back end and stars painted all over it and was currently yanking his bars up to finally do a wheelie, having had to hold it in all the way up the hill. He barely registered what his friends were saying to him. He whipped his front tire around and shot them a big cheesy grin, leaving them both to wonder for the thousandth time since meeting him if grandparents raising Gen Z was having genuinely lasting problems on society.
</p>
<p>
	After a lot more pedaling and a lot more screams of excitement from Wild Will, the three arrived at the edge of town, turning off the main road and pedaling up the middle of main street. Every window was dim, and not a single soul was on the street except for them. And even more fucked up and spooky was the fact that nothing was making any noise as far as any of them could hear besides the drone of their bike ties and the humming of the power lines above them now and then.
</p>
<p>
	The three finally skidded their bikes to a stop directly in front of the town library. Archie stepped off his bike and jogged over to the dark unlit front doors of the building and peered into them as best he could. He turned to his companions and shook his head before making the short jog back.
</p>
<p>
	“No one’s in there. The sign on the door says they’re open until 10, but it’s completely empty.” Archie said, shoving his hands into the pockets of his windbreaker.
</p>
<p>
	“I just noticed…” Becka said tentatively, looking around them in every direction before turning her eyes back to her friends. “The streetlights aren’t on here yet? It’s pretty dark…”
</p>
<p>
	The three of them looked up at the empty dark blue sky which was blackening by the second above them. Soon none of them would be able to see much.
</p>
<p>
	Archie dug into his backpack, rooting around inside of it for a few minutes before letting out an exasperated groan. “I packed three flashlights! I know I did! Where did they–”
</p>
<p>
	Both Achie and Becka turned their eyes to Wild Will who was idly juggling all three flashlights with a completely blank thoughtless look on his face. There was a moment of silence as the two non-insane children exchanged glances before Wild Will finally took notice.
</p>
<p>
	“OH! Oh, shit, yeah, my bad.” He stopped juggling and held out two of the flashlights to his friends and kept one for himself. “I just get bored real easy and also don’t have much of a grip on reality because my grandparents refuse to have me medicated for my many social disorders and mental illnesses, as is the case for the majority of school age children in the United States of America.”
</p>
<p>
	Archie and Becka exchanged glances once more, flicking their flashlights on reflexively once they had them.
</p>
<p>
	“What? It’s a genuine widespread societal problem.” Archie responded, flicking his own light on. “Not everything needs to be a fuckin’ punchline in these stories.”
</p>
<p>
	“Fair enough.” Becka said, sweeping down the street in either direction with her light. “Maybe we oughta go home. I can’t really see anything around here and it’s starting to REALLY freak me out.”
</p>
<p>
	“C’mon guys!” Archie said emphatically. “We gotta find out what happened to this place! A few of the older kids said just a few weeks ago this was a bustling little place and now it’s a complete ghost town? There has to be a reason behind that and none of the parents seem to give a hoot. They just keep talking about stuff like taxes and The Masked Singer. They’ve obviously lost the will to live - but we haven’t!”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re right!” Becka said with a resounding clap of her hands over the flashlight. “Let’s do some investigating, I bet we can get to the bottom of this.”
</p>
<p>
	“I bet you I can jump off that roof and survive.” Wild Will said, pointing at a two-story house down the street.
</p>
<p>
	“Hey, hey.” Archie placed his hands on Wild Bill’s shoulders then pointed at his eyes and then back at his own with two fingers. “Focus for me, ok?”
</p>
<p>
	“Man, I’ll fuckin’ try.” Wild Will said with a shrug.
</p>
<p>
	“Ok now hands in. Who are we?” Archie said with a huge grin, placing his hand out into the center of the three of them.
</p>
<p>
	Becka and Wild Will placed their hands on top and rocked down and then all three threw their hands into the air and shouted “THE SPOOKY SQUAD!”
</p>
<p>
	They all laughed in delight. “Man, good thing nobody ever copyrighted that.” Becka chuckled.
</p>
<p>
	After they did their dumb little call and response they set out to canvas the streets together on their bikes, going up one lane and down the other. All along the way they kept their eyes peeled for any sign of life. No dog barked, no window lit up, no sound but their own ever rang out in the night - nothing. They decided to redouble their efforts - they looked inside trash cans and found nothing. They knocked on doors, rang door bells, Wild Will even broke a few windows by throwing rocks into them, and nothing ever happened. No matter where they looked, nothing seemed to exist in this entire town except empty houses, empty streets, and the three of them.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m actually starting to get scared now. “ Wild Will said, prompting gasps from both of his friends. He rolled his eyes and knocked on his helmet with his knuckles. “I’m fearless about STUNTS and shit, man. I’m not trynna get eaten by a Baghoul or whatever. Let’s get the fuck out of here.”
</p>
<p>
	“I can’t believe I’m saying this but I guess I … agree? With Wild Will?” Becka said, confusion in her voice.
</p>
<p>
	“Wait…” Archie hushed the other two and pointed down the street toward an unassuming house on the corner. The other two kids turned to follow his gaze, seeing an extremely dim green light in the window which seemed to pulse slightly brighter then sink back into darkness. “What IS that…?”
</p>
<p>
	“Looks to me exactly like something that if we go in there to check out will cause us all to die horrible gruesome horror movie deaths, Archie.” Becka said with aggravation curling up her features.
</p>
<p>
	“Look are we The Spooky Squad or The Too Scared to Look at Spooky Stuff Cause We’ll Pee Our Pants and Have to Get Picked Up By Grandma Squad?” Archie said, annoyance creeping up in his voice as well.
</p>
<p>
	By the time Archie and Becka noticed that Wild Will was gone, he was already over a third of the way down the street toward the house on his bike. They both sighed.
</p>
<p>
	“Apparently he’s not as afraid of Baghouls as he thought.” Archie said with a shake of his head, both kids mounting up their bikes and riding after their friend down the street.
</p>
<p>
	Wild Will had the wherewithal to at least wait for his friends to meet him at the front door before he did anything else. Archie grabbed his hand before he could reach the handle though and yanked it back. Silently he motioned toward the window they had all seen the light emanating from as an alternative. Wild Will and Becka both nodded in agreement.
</p>
<p>
	The three of them crept across the slightly too-tall, dewey wet grass, their sneakers squeaking against the wetness in the still of the night. It felt like way too long a time before they finally reached the window and hunkered below the sill. The three friends exchanged glances, then nods, and then jolted up to peer into the dark window above them.
</p>
<p>
	Inside was an unassuming living room, decorated in the unmistakable style of a grandmother’s touch - knicknacks, curios, and glass sculpture of questionable taste resting on every surface, a doily beneath. The kind of home that looked more like an uncomfortable but affordable roadside Inn than any place anyone actually lived. But the real sight to behold was in the very center of the room, where a coffee table had once been but not had been displaced back against the far wall.
</p>
<p>
	Sitting in its place, slowly rolling in and on itself and pushing outward and back in from the force from inside it was a pulsating, undulating mass of green, bubbling semi-solid. It gave off a faint greenish light with each pulse, like a bioluminescent heartbeat coming from inside. All across the floor on either side of it was a strange brown-greenish goo which the gigantic green mass was sucking into itself, like maybe it was consuming it.
</p>
<p>
	All three kids whipped around and dropped onto their butts back on the ground, their backs against the plastic siding on the outside of the house. They breathed heavily and stared out into the night, silence passing between them for what felt like an uncomfortable amount of time.
</p>
<p>
	“What IS that?!” Becka finally broke the impasse, her voice a hoarse whisper a little too loud than she meant it to be.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s like some kinda pod or something? I can’t even imagine what would be in that…” Archie whispered in return, his own voice quieter but no less frayed with fear at its edges despite his false bravado all night up til this point.
</p>
<p>
	“Look, let’s get the fuck out of here before Slither pops out of that shit and worms up our assholes, ok?” Wild Will said at full volume, standing up to his full height in front of the window.
</p>
<p>
	“SHHHH!!” both other kids hissed out at him, each grabbing one of his arms and yanking him back down to a seated position on the ground.
</p>
<p>
	“Are you fucking NUTS?!” Archie scream-yelled, throwing Wild Will’s arm back at his own chest in annoyance. “That thing in there could be ANYTHING! We gotta be quiet and figure out what to do next.”
</p>
<p>
	“What to do NEXT?” Becka cried out, still attempting to whisper despite how stupid her little cracker friend was being at the moment. “Next we go the fuck home and forget we ever saw this. Like sensible people. Like people who AREN’T in a horror movie.”
</p>
<p>
	“Podcast.” Wild Will corrected.
</p>
<p>
	“What?” Becka shot her head around to look back at Wild Will.
</p>
<p>
	“Look, whatever is in there may be what happened to all the people in this town. We need to at least get a picture of it so we can prove something is going on here. Right?” Archie dug into his backpack and returned with his cell phone clutched in his hand. He looked back at his companions who were now sharing an incredulous look together at his expense. “Right?” he repeated.
</p>
<p>
	“I mean I GUESS.” Becka threw her hands up in defeat.
</p>
<p>
	“You’re both outta your fuckin’ mind, man.” Wild Will said, but then took a moment, then sighed. “Fine, snap one pic for the Gram and then we fuckin’ skedaddle.”
</p>
<p>
	All three kids crept back up to the window in unison, Archie bringing his phone up to his face and very quickly and adeptly pressing the snapshot button on the screen like all boomers wish they could.
</p>
<p>
	“WAIT!” Becka called out at full volume, but it was too late. The flash on Archie’s camera went off, illuminating the entire room on the other side of the window in bright, blinding light. All three kids winced, and braced themselves for the absolute worst.
</p>
<p>
	But nothing happened. They blinked at one another and Archie quickly shoved his phone back into his pocket. The three all swiveled on a dime to gawk back into the window with hopes that nothing had changed inside for the worst.
</p>
<p>
	Hopes that were completely dashed when they saw the pulsating green gelatinous shape had seemingly split open and collapsed in on itself, leaving only a radioactively glowing slurry all over the floor in its place. The terrified worry on each of their faces was reflected into the next one as they looked at once another.
</p>
<p>
	“What did… what happened to…” Archie sputtered out, staring back into the window as the gelatinous mass. 
</p>
<p>
	The three dropped back to the ground and hid their backs against the siding once more below the window. Becka snatched the phone from Archie’s hand and stuffed it into her jacket pocket in one motion, glaring at him with a fiery rage. Each of them was breathing heavily but Wild Will was the first to swallow his fear and speak. “Maybe… maybe the flash caused it to like… fall in on itself? Like a souffle or something?”
</p>
<p>
	“What do you know about souffles?” Becka suddenly snapped back to reality, completely taken aback by this death-wish having weirdo knowing baking.
</p>
<p>
	“Look all I’m saying is–”
</p>
<p>
	A four foot long curved blade exploded out of the plastic siding behind Wild Will and punctured completely through his abdomen, its shining coarse metal caked with the young man’s blood as it emerged into the night’s air. 
</p>
<p>
	Archie and Becka screamed at the top of their lungs, diving away from their skewered friend and fumbling up to their feet to run in different directions blindly away from the carnage. From the corner of their vision they could see back behind them that the blade was dancing in and out of the boy, splaying blood and intestines into the air like a fountain from its continued hollowing of his body. Wild Will’s eyes were wide with surprise, and blood flew from his opened, visually screaming mouth, but no sound escaped him.
</p>
<p>
	Archie mounted his bike as fast as he could and began pedaling down the street away from the horror behind him, his mind racing for survival too fast to understand he may be leaving his friends to grisly deaths. It was certainly too late for Wild Will. He turned down the street at it’s corner, his hoarse breaths rattling out of his dangling open mouth as he pushed himself as hard as he could. He could feel the distance between him and death and was working overtime to extend it.
</p>
<p>
	But the once silent night was now filled with the loud, violent screeching of the thing that killed one of his best friends, and it echoed off of every empty alleyway and house facia - so much so that he couldn’t tell whether it was a mile away or right behind him.
</p>
<p>
	The long, bladed fingers which dug into the back of his head and wrenched him back off of his bike answered that question for him, unfortunately. His head hit the concrete first, causing his entire world to go spinning out of control from the force of the blow. He crumpled into a heap, his bike sailing off without him into a nearly perfectly trimmed bush outside of a 500,000 dollar home left empty down the street.
</p>
<p>
	His world whirled and turned and he tried his hardest to right it, grasping onto the asphalt beneath him though it burned his skinned palms to do so. When he threw his head back through the haze in his mind he could make out the shape of a gigantic creature standing overtop of him. It threw its head back and it’s face split open to screech at the sky - sputtering blood and viscera into the air as it did. From the corner of it’s split open hole, human intestine dropped onto the road next to where Archie lay and he would have wretched in disgust had not the panic clenched at his very soul. 
</p>
<p>
	He reached over his shoulder and felt the tiniest sliver of relief at the feel of the wooden haft of his louisville slugger meeting his palm. He yanked it from his pack and rolled onto his backside, gripping it with both hands and swinging away with every bit of strength left in his body. 
</p>
<p>
	CLUNK!
</p>
<p>
	The bat hit something so solid that it stopped instantly, the reverb causing it to wrench itself from his hands and clatter violently onto the road, rolling away from him all at once. He tried to scream out, but a flash in the night stopped him somehow. 
</p>
<p>
	He would never know why he couldn’t scream in that moment, the last vision he ever had was the entire world turning upside down and his viewpoint spinning away from where it had been and landing on the cold, unforgiving pavement too far away for his reckoning. And then nothing.
</p>
<p>
	The blade had sluiced through the meat and bone of his neck cleanly, and the force of the blade’s motion had sent his head flying down the street, landing with a disgusting thud against the ground a dozen feet away. The massive bladed creature then dropped to the ground and unhinged the horrific hole in its face once more - diving into the corpse of the boy and beginning to feast upon it with wet, haphazard gulps and bites.
</p>
<p>
	—------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	Becka ran as hard and as fast as she could across the empty homes front lawns, staring back over her shoulder into the darkness for any sign of movement following her. She could barely breath, the cold night air stinging her lungs with every heaving breath, but she couldn’t stop - carried along on the speedy wings of absolute terror. 
</p>
<p>
	She turned down a sidestreet and then up another, cutting across another front lawn and through a backyard in an attempt to make herself harder to catch. She knew basically where she was relative to everything in the town, but she wasn’t from here, she’d never been here before, so it was getting harder and harder by the second to tell if she was going in the right direction.
</p>
<p>
	She turned down one last alleyway and then skidded to a stop, her eyes wide and her heartbeat suddenly feeling like it completely stopped in her chest.
</p>
<p>
	At the end of an alleyway a man stood. He wore a long overcoat and a low-slung hat with a wide brim and was standing in the direct center of her path, backlit by the little light of the moon left in the night.
</p>
<p>
	“Wh-who… who are you?!” she screamed out, but the man simply held up a hand to request her silence.
</p>
<p>
	“I live in this house right here and heard a commotion.” He said in a warm, welcoming tone, pointing at the hose next to where he stood. “I thought something might be wrong so I put on my old coat and come out to see. Are you ok, little girl?”
</p>
<p>
	Becka felt herself ease up slightly, but then frantically began to point behind her and close to distance between herself and the good samaritan. “Oh my god, there’s a … there’s a monster! A .. a something! It killed my friend Will! It killed him!” she screamed out.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh my…” the man said, placing his hand to his lips. “That is good news.”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s still…!” she paused, turning to look up at the man now that she was five or six feet from him. She took a step back, raising her hands up between them. “...what?”
</p>
<p>
	From beneath the man’s overcoat a gigantic prehensile limb shot out into the night’s air, the recurved pointed blade at its end piercing directly into the young girl's stomach and raising her up off the ground from its force. 
</p>
<p>
	Becka sputtered and tried to scream, but blood just drooped from her mouth down onto the ground far below her. The strange slimy bladed limb she dangled from slithered through the air and drew her in closer to the man in the overcoat until he could reach his hand up and into her coat pocket. He returned with Archie’s phone in his hand and began to fiddle with it idly with his thumb on the screen out of her view.
</p>
<p>
	The barely visible night around her began to dim further and further, the pain in her entire body getting further away as she watched him, until she could watch no longer.
</p>
<p>
	The man in the overcoat looked at the photo on the phone Archie had taken earlier. It clearly showed the unimaginable horror that had assailed them being birthed from its horrific green cocoon and slithering into the darkness beyond the flash. The man smiled and typed into a number onto the phone’s call screen and held it to his ear.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s me. I’ve arrived in Whitesville, Connecticut as advised. No. None have survived. Yes. Subject Number 2 has come to full fruition.”
</p>
<p>
	He paused for a moment, listening to the other line.
</p>
<p>
	“Tachibana is loose once more, yes. We have received better data telemetry on the next generation Chrysalids than ever before from his previous escape. We will continue to monitor him.”
</p>
<p>
	The man listened intently and then a venomous smile spread across his lips, too wide and too tall for anyone truly human.
</p>
<p>
	“Yes… Hail Gestalt.”
</p>
<p>
	He held the phone out at arms length and then crushed it between his elongated fingers like it was made of paper mache. His hand opened to let the phone drop to the ground and he turned around and began to wall away.
</p>
<p>
	His bladed limb whipped in the air, throwing the corpse of the young Becka Washington into a vacant front yard haphazardly, as someone would throw away trash.
</p>
<p>
	—---------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	Back in the house where the horriric monster had been birthed, across the room from the gelatinous remains of the cocoon that birthed it, undisturbed and still in perfect shape, lay a large pile of purplish gray ashes, the remnants of an unwarranted murder.
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
