Fear & Loathing in Kirby, Connecticut

Taxidermy & Coffee

By Jeff Pennington


Previously on Spookyvision, which is the name of my thing on the show if you didn’t know, I barely ever say it so it’s totally understandable, don’t sweat it too much…


Violent undiagnosed psychopath Jason Grace traveled home to speak with his father about his still-missing little brother Archie (who eagle-eared viewers know got fuckin’ pulped to death by Cricketman but they don’t know that shit yet).


After a heart-warming reunion where no one called anyone “a disgusting little missed money-shot” and/or accused anyone of daydreaming about attended a donkey show with the host of History Channel television series “Forged in Fire”, Jason’s father gifted him a fireman’s axe that’s probably like magic or has alien energy or some shit inside of it knowing this stupid ass fucking show.


Jason then cranked his hog HARD and drove off into the actual sunset to escape Jeff Pennington’s daddy issues drowning him on the page. 


Meanwhile across town every degenerate freak who ever perused a sub-reddit had gathered in the Budget Inn Ballroom & Event Space for the world’s only extremely niche convention for both Cryptid fanatics and hackers - THE SCRIPT KIDS AND CRYPTIDS CONVENTION. Hey, writing a new story is WAY easier when you just use the jokes from the last one! I gotta remember that from now on.


Beloved 90’s sitcom caricature Dev Durwood the Third just so happened, through the magic of storytelling, to be the big presenter for the evening and Jason Grace happened to be in the audience because I’m running out of ways to make these fuckers meet up with each other, so sue me. What neither of them counted on though was a BIG SCARY ASS COCKROACH SWARM to attack them from some nasty old geezer’s fuckin’ pie hole and a bunch of spooky shit happening with the lights and shit it was FUCKED.


We now return you to the continuation of Spookyvision…


Dev closed his eyes as tight as he could, and covered his ears with his hands, but the sight of thousands of cockroaches crawling toward him like an ocean wave would be seared into his sight for the rest of his life - and there was absolutely no escape from the sound of chittering that filled the hall to bursting beyond its limits.


He was screaming like a lil’ BITCH loud enough that it drowned it all out a little bit though.


Jason swung his axe wildly in the air to and fro, his teeth gritted as it’s razor sharp edge swiped fruitlessly at the oncoming hoard that had now began to rise up like water around his legs, all the way up to his thighs deep in cockroaches which scurried up his body in droves to drown him underneath the weight of their skittering insect bodies. He finally gave in to the driving terror in him and screamed his lungs out as well, his feet losing their purchase beneath him and his entire body toppling over into the writhing mass of insects engulfing the stage.


The last thing Jason Grace and Devin Durwood the Third heard in that moment… was laughing?


Dev slowly opened his eyes, fear shambling him and causing him to take his time with the effort. But instead of a red room filled to the brim with cockroaches he was greeted by the same old half-empty Budget Hotel event space filled with giggling hideous nerds that he had been dealing with before any of this happened. He rubbed at his eyes beneath his oversized coke-bottle glasses and blinked away any distrust in what he was seeing - the crowd was back and they were laughing at him.


“They’re freaking out! HAW! Must be REY SKYWALKER fans!” one pimply-faced teenage boy screeched out, holding up a gigantic cardboard sign that had Rey’s head labeled “New Star Wars” dangling from a noose attached to a tree labeled “Good writing.” Even he did not know what he was trying to get across with the sign. The crowd nonetheless erupted into laughter at his joke with quotation marks around it.


“What’s wrong? Upset we saw through your BLATANT RUSE of so-called evidence for the existence of a giant cricket monster you CHARLATAN?!” a heavy-set middle aged man with a skullet ponytail stood up, pointing up at the stage with vitriol in his voice. He was wearing a t-shirt which had Bart Simpson on it with a speech bubble coming from his head that said ‘Peace in the middle east? Yeah right, man! And I’m Ross Perot!”’ Below this were the gigantic numbers 1991 right next to a strange unidentifiable orange-ish stain.


One fairly normal looking woman stood up and pointed at the stage, clearly the only one not reveling in the failure of a peer enough to miss the blatantly fucking obvious real problem in the room, and screamed out “HOLY SHIT, HE’S GOT AN AXE!”


The room erupted into high pitched squeaky screams as the nerds began to bolt in every direction, down every aisle, their arms raised in the air and the flap of skin under there just goin’ crazy with the movement. They trampled over each other to head for the emergency exits at the sides of the room, doing a fucking TERRIBLE job of it and just constantly slipping and falling over each other.


One of the nerds fell over onto a boom box that one of the other nerds had brought in order to cosplay as Radio Raheem from Do The Right Thing, which eagle-eyed viewers of that movie will note is a fuckin’ wild thing to cosplay as, but the nerd who hit the boombox instantly activated it - causing the speakers to blast out Yakity Sax at full blast which as you can imagine only added to the hilarity of the situation.


During all of this, Jason Grace stood transfixed in place, holding his axe up in the air in a ready-to-swing stance as he’d just a moment earlier been trying to home-run swing cockroaches off of him frantically. What in the flying fuck had happened? Was it some kind of a dream? Did all those years experimenting with ketamine finally catch up to him? Could all those cartoon characters on that VHS tape have been right all along?


It took him a few more moments before he finally noticed the bull stampede of dweeblings which threatened to shake the stage they stood on into splinters. Not that it wasn’t made out of planks of particle board and stacks of Highlights Magazines underneath of anything, but they didn’t know that shit. 


He threw his head back around to stare at Dev, finally lowering his axe down to his side. “YOU SAW THAT, RIGHT?!” he screamed over the din of the crowd and the wailing novelty of comedic saxophone, though it wasn’t much louder than his normal voice, to be real honest.


“Y-yeah…? I think?” Dev squeemishly answered, standing back up to his feet in a real Weeble-esque fashion. He quickly dusted off his overalls, jerkily moving from pose to pose to try to see every part of him to check for roaches with a frantic squeak every movement. “WHEH! HECH! WHA?!”


“Stop! Fucking stop!” Jason yelled out, grabbing Dev by his shoulders. “If you saw what I saw then it can’t be fake! There really was some old fucker with a belly-ful of cockroaches just blasting them out of his gullet like the reader’s mom on a Friday night after ingesting one too many cocktails and also drinks, if you catch my drift!”


“What?” Dev cried out in return.


“Nevermind, we gotta get the fuck outta here!” Jason hoisted Dev up by the shoulder of his overalls and placed him on the steps down the side of the stairs like he weighed the same as like a couple grapes, causing Dev’s legs to flail around in the air until he found purchase on the ground again.


“WHAT? But why? Cause the cockroach guy is coming back?” Dev yelled out, jolting his head around in every direction to see the freaks approach.


“Nah because I’m wanted by the police in this town.” Jason pushed Dev to move down the steps as he spoke.


“Mama mia…” Dev muttered fearfully under his breath.


The crowd had mostly dispersed by now, leaving the event space looking pretty spacious indeed. Chairs were laying on their sides all over the place, and there was just a bunch of paper and shit all over the floor. Where do crowds of people get so much fucking paper and shit to just leave behind when there’s a riot or something, anyway? Ticker tape can’t be this god damn cheap.


Aaaaanyway.


Our heroes(?) pressed on through the destruction, through a pair of double doors, and into a service hallway at the back of the hall. Jason peered back through the inset glass windows above the door handles, watching as the last few screaming dweeby stragglers disappeared never to be seen by polite society ever again I hope. He then motioned down the hall and both of them went walking together towards its other end.


“Uhhh… so where are we goin’ anyway, Mr…. Angry Axe Maniac?” Dev asked as politely as he could muster.


“I’m not really sure yet.” Jason said idly, peering back over his shoulders toward the double doors. “I’m not gonna lie I was kind of expecting police sirens by now.” he said with a little chuckle.


Both men then paused in place and stood silently, waiting in place. They exchanged harried glances for a moment, and when no siren appeared, they began to walk down the hall again.


“Your slideshow had a photo of the trenchcoat guy from Whitesville in it. Well, when he’s a big bug man thing anyway. Where’d you get that?” Jason broke the silence.


“Trenchcoat guy? A bunch of paramilitary goons let that dude out of a truck to attack an office building! That’s Cricket Man! He’s not just some guy, he’s a cryptid, and I’m gonna prove his existence to the whole world!” Dev said firmly, slapping his fist into his palm.


“Paramilitary? What the fuck are you dorking about, dweeb? There was a reject from the Country & Western Hall of Fame who turned into a snake and a wannabe Matrix extra who turned into a gigantic grasshopper and they fought so hard it blew up a fucking house! What’s so hard to understand about that?” Jason snapped in return.


“Pretty much all of it, honestly.” Dev stuttered out, rubbing the side of his head idly, but then immediately perked up. “Wait, you’re telling me there are more of these kinds of cryptids around here?!” 


“What the fuck, that’s not a GOOD thing you gross little monster pervert! These things are fucked, man!” Jason spat out, angrily, as usual, “They almost killed me and the gross old drunk I was with! And not even for bashing their friend at a bar for not liking ZZ Top like a civilized person - just for stepping foot into Whitesville.”


“I know where I’m going when I’m no longer kidnapped!” Dev exclaimed, not paying attention at all at this point.

“I’m not fucking kidnapping you, are you listening to me?!” Jason spat out.


WEEE OOOO WWEEE OOO WEE OOO (or whatever cop cars sound like)


The conversation was cut off by the oncoming sound of police sirens - and from the echo on them more than just a few. They were approaching incredibly rapidly as well.


“Just a couple minutes off.” Jason said in defeat.


“Pretty good honestly.” Dev responded.


Jason immediately broke out into a sprint, pumping his arms and legs as he made up the distance down the hall toward the other set of double doors at their end. He shouldered the doors open when he arrived, sending the heavy mechanical door flying outward as he did. He found himself at the back of the building, running through a walled-in delivery area where a couple large delivery trucks were parked. 


Turning his head to look behind him to see if anyone was following he was shocked beyond words to find there was someone hot on his trail - the weird wiry nerd he’d just left behind in the hall.


“Why the fuck are you running too?!” Jason yelled back at Dev in a hoarse whisper, trying not to gain any attention beyond the dweeb.


“Oh you’re asking why…huff… a black guy…huff… doesn’t wanna wait around…huff… to see the cops?!” Dev responded between heaving, out of air breathes, trying his hardest to keep up with Jason’s running as they passed around the corner of the loading dock and out onto the alley beside the Budget Inn.


Jason stopped, placing a hand against the wall, and peered around as best he could to figure out where to head next, as Dev finally caught up to him. “Yeah… that makes perfect sense. Gotcha.”


“A…huff…cab…” Dev managed to breathe out.


“Fuck the police.” Jason responded, then jerked his head toward the opposite end of the alleyway. “Follow me.”


“No wait!” Dev held up a hand to stop him from running off. “I know a place we can hide where no one will find us! It’s always deserted and the owner owes me a favor!”


Jason looked back at Dev, then toward the other end of the alley, then back again. “UGHH, fine, fine! You lead the way, kid.”


“Well first off, I think we’re the same age! I just didn’t get the steroid gene naturally from my family tree like you did!” Dev said, motioning for Jason to follow him toward the opposite end of the alleyway. The two of them slunk toward it as quickly as they could. “Secondly, my name is Devin Durwood the Third… but you can call me Dev! My friends call me that.” He paused. “Don’t ask about them, they live in Canada.”


“Yeah, yeah. I’m Jason Grace. I don’t really having the fucking time to…” Jason paused, turning his head back to look at Dev with a scrunched up confused face. “Devin Durwood the Third? Is your dad “Big Devil” Durwood from the 90’s Bills? What the fuck happened to you did you shrink in the wash? Did they forget the rest of you at the hospital?”


“Hardy har har, very funny! Like I said, I missed the burly gym bro genetics that run in the family. But I was gifted with a genius beyond the kin of normal men! And a face card that ranks a ten in EVERYONE’S eyes, baby!” Dev mugged for a studio audience that no longer exists in this day and age outside of CW shows that play before anything teenagers like.


Jason grimaced. “Where are we going, Dev?”


“Well it’s just–” Dev began, but immediately stopped when the dark blue leftover light that clings to the air just past sunset shifted harshly and violently toward a new morning red. The entire alleyway seemed to breathe in on them, and the opening toward the road in front of them shot closed like the end of a laundry bag drawn tight by the strings. 


Jason and Dev spun around on their heels, bathed in the virulent red light they had only experienced just earlier that evening for the first time in their lives. The alley swelled in and out like the lungs of a gigantic breathing beast and all sounds had ceased except the horrific grinding of stone on stone in the brick walls that surrounded them as they moved.


At the end of the alleyway, far, far away from them now, stood the same gnarled old man as had appeared before them in the convention center. He walked slowly toward them, his gigantic bulging eyes rolling around in their sunken sockets as he took one unnatural step after another, crossing the distance between them like a colossus takes each step, though he couldn’t have been any taller than 5 foot five (sorry to all the short kings out there watching, keep your head up, it adds an inch I hear.)


The old man shuffled and stumbled toward them like a drunkard, each step carrying him twenty feet easily, and his mouth stretching, stretching, stretching across his face - the skin at it’s edges tearing and bleeding from the unnatural growth.


Jason grasped the haft of his fireman’s axe once again, drawing it from the duffel bag that hung loosely from his shoulder like a knight unsheathes his mighty sword, dangling it at his side at the ready.


The shivering husk of a man approaching whimpered words that barely squeaked audibly past his gnashing, overlarge teeth which grinded against one another painfully, his voice barely a hoarse whisper, “Let’s… remember… together…”


Dev was terrified beyond all reason, his entire body quaking with a fear that threatened to shake him apart from the inside. But still, he noticed something that Jason did not. Something that Jason could not. A memory which welled up in him all at once, though it also felt like something had been keeping it from him for a long, long time.


The memory of a trip to his grandmother’s house when he was a child. A small old doll which had once looked like a dapper blonde gentleman with a bowler that had withered with time and disuse to become a decrepit little old man with a beaked nose. He had reached out to pick it up when cleaning the attic, though his grandma had warned him not to. As his hand had brushed over it, the doll’s old felt mouth had been forced open, stitching ripping around it’s face, to reveal a perpetual onslaught of a dozen cockroaches pouring from their hiding place within. He had never felt fear like that before in his life.


“Jason, oh my god, it’s–”


But Jason’s axe crashed down into the shivering old man’s forehead in that exact moment. The crushing weight of the blow pulped the front of the old freak’s face, sending it splintering in twain and causing his body to begin convulsing almost immediately. The hideous shriek which escaped it was almost instantly followed by a sizzling, violent burning from within the wound - the blade of the axe seemingly setting the old creature alight within a couple seconds of touching it. 


Jason yanked the axe back out of the wound, and watched as the burning within the body began to spread like wildfire across it’s smashed and battered face, down it’s neck and through it’s jagged misshapen limbs until nothing was left in its wake except a pile of smoldering ash on the ground. 


“....Nevermind.” Dev muttered, eyes the size of saucers staring at the aftermath.


Both men caught sight of a strange flickering in the air in front of them, and squinted hard in the blood red darkness of the alleyway to make out what it was. Both had somehow figured in their subconscious thoughts that destroying the thing would release them from this scarlet tinted hellscape, but here they both stood, still trapped within it.


The glinting of metal passed to and fro in the air and suddenly Dev knew what he was looking at. Wires. Four long, silver steel wires which were being wound up into the air and away from them. Dev followed the path of them up as well as he could, unable to keep up with the speed, but at their apex, directly in line with a blood red moon which hung low in the sky above them, he caught just the slightest flash of something there, so high in the sky as to be nearly invisible.


And then it was gone. It was all gone. Jason and Dev were standing in the middle of an alleyway that had nothing strange or supernatural about it in the least.


“What the fuck just…?” Jason wobbled on his feet, clutching the fireman’s axe to his chest as he gawked at where the corpse he had burnt from the inside out with a fucking axe somehow had once been lain. “Did I kill it…?”


“I don’t think so…” Dev rubbed his face with both hands, seeking some kind of normalcy and comfort from it as he tried to steel his nerves. “It was some kind of puppet, I think? There were wires controlling it from really high up…”


“That’s what those flashing glints of silver were?!” Jason turned to stare at Dev in astonishment. “Those glasses must be as fucking telescopic as they look, god damn!”


The sound of sirens was no longer in the distance, they had settled on the other side of the hotel complex from them. It was plain to hear they weren’t going to be alone for very much longer.


“Let’s go, follow me!” Dev called out, turning and running out of the alley at full speed without even looking both ways - WHICH COULD GET YOUR DUMB ASS KILLED, SO DON’T DO IT AT HOME. IDIOT.


—------------------------------------------------------------------


A few action-packed scenes later and Jason and Dev had arrived at the safe spot that Dev had been talking up as impenetrable and perfectly protected the entire time they had been heading in this direction - Uncle Otis’ Dead-Ass Animals Emporium and Coffee House. Got ‘em both in one shot, eat my ass!


“You gotta be fucking my shit with this bullshit…” Jason mumbled low and quiet as the two of them slid through the all-glass front door with a soft jingle of the bell over it. 


“You’re kind of a gross guy, Jason.” Dev returned, just as hushed as the door slid closed on a spring behind them.


The front room of the taxidermy shop had a half dozen small round tables with two chairs on either side, a couple big comfy chairs, and even a couch, just like any coffee house would have. But it’s walls were lined with every type of animal you could possibly hunt and a few of them you couldn’t. Bears, wolves, foxes, rabbits, elf, moose, even a buffalo though that was probably pretty frowned on in this day and age considering what we did to them, RIP, were proudly stuffed and on display everywhere around them.


“You brought me to a fucking dead animal corpse parlor and I’m the gross one for using colorful language sometimes? You’re a godamn nut.” Jason scoffed.

“Uncle Otis! Are you here?” Dev called out, hands cupped around his mouth. The sudden shrill loudness caused Jason to flinch, though he played it off as best he could.


“‘Zat my favorite nephew out chear right nah?!” a booming southern drawl exploded from the back of the shop. The swinging doors at the back of the dining area burst open and from within it came a gigantic white man with greasy gray hair and an oversized handlebar mustache with the biggest smile on his face you could imagine. He stomped over in his oversized hunting boots and scooped Dev up into a bear hug against his greasy old apron he wore over a hawaiian shirt and khaki shorts. “I ain’t seen you in an AGE, kiddo!”


“He’s not my actual uncle.” Dev said matter-of-factly, returning Uncle Otis’ big hug with a big smile of his own. 


“Oh for real?” Jason said with rueful sarcasm in his voice.


“Now what brings ya heah on this fine evenin’, Dev my boy? You lookin’ for a nice cup of coffee? Or a rat?” Uncle Otis made a sweeping hand gesture at a display of twelve different types of rats right next to a large percolator. Like RIGHT next to it. Jason tried not to wretch.


“No thanks, Uncle Otis! Not this time. We’re just looking for a place to cool our heels until the heat dies down!” Dev said covertly, hand covering half his mouth.


“Heat from what, kiddo? You in some kinda hot water I oughta know about?” Otis leaned in closer, obviously kind of excited by the prospect of trouble coming his way.


“Ooooh yeah! We’re bein’ pursued by some kind of wily cryptid I’ve never even heard of before!” Dev immediately came alive with the excitement of a weasely little dweeb talking about their special interest. “You know I know all my cryptids too! I studied them every night while all my classmates were putting each others genitals inside of one another! I had plenty of time to learn! But I’ve never even caught a glimpse of this one yet!”


The moment Dev began to speak about Cryptids the light in Uncle Otis’ eyes dimmed completely and all excitement left his face. He just began nodding his head and letting out a tired “Uh-huh…” every couple seconds. Jason suddenly liked this old grease-slinger juuuuust fine.


“We just want a couple cups of coffee and maybe access to a… private room, if you catch my drift. We’ve got 5-0 behind us and not a lot of ideas in front of us, if you follow me.” Jason said with a wry smile.


Uncle Otis looked back and forth between Jason and Dev and then shrugged a little. “If you want a room to fuck in without your parents findin’ out about it you coulda just asked, Dev.” he said matter-of-factly. “I ain’t standin’ in the way of love of any kind, just follow me.”


“What the FUCK, I’m not fuckin’ this nerd! Have you seen me? I’m hot as fucking shit, dude, I could get a WAY better twink than this!” Jason blurted out in anger pretty instantly, fists balling at his sides. Dev looked a little offended, but mostly understood.


“We just need a place to figure out our next move, is all, Uncle Otis. You understand from your old wheelin’ and dealin’ days, right?” Dev said with a sly wink.


“Of course! Of course!” Uncle Otis said with a big wink. “Just clean up after you’d done railin’ on each other.”


He then turned and walked to the back of the dining room, holding the swinging door open and motioning them to go through. Jason seethed a little as he walked into the back, hands shoved into the pockets of his jacket and his head down. Dev just obviously went on in.


Uncle Otis ushered them into a fairly large storage area at the back of the shop. As you could imagine it was a horrific mish-mash of food stuffs, coffee ingredients, and the purposefully stuffed corpses of dead animals which is someone’s shit out there I just couldn’t fucking imagine who. Otis flicked on a light in the middle of the room, a bulb dangling under a heavy metal shade, and the room illuminated with lights here and there over its length which impressively must’ve been a quarter of a football field. You look that up, I’m not doing it.


“Damn, Uncle Otis, this place is massive. Who is your real estate agent around here to get a place THIS huge?” Jason said with a smirk and a shake of his head.


“I got a special in with the biggest agent in the area. They call her the Queen Bee even.” Uncle Otis said with a goofy smile. “Anyway, I’ll leave you boys at it. Animal grease is on shelf 19 if you get chafe-y. Good night!” then he was out and slammed the door shut behind him, leaving only the echo of his words hanging in the air. 


There was a moment of silence as Dev looked excitedly around at all the dead ephermera placed here and there awaiting stuffing and Jason stood dumbfounded and quiet.


“....animal grease…?” he finally whispered out incredulously.


“Anyway, I know a lot about the people behind all this! That was a big part of my presentation if you were paying attention.” Dev said with a slight snort of arrogance in his voice.


“Well, I wasn’t.” Jason returned flatly.


“These cryptids are controlled by an organization called Gestalt! They’re some kind of a scientific research cabal with a ton of connections all over the states! I can’t even begin to tell ya what all they’ve been involved in over the years, it would blow your little pea brain right out of the pointed top of that hard head of yours!” Dev gestured wildly as he spoke. “I got tons of files on ‘em back at my house! You can come visit and mom’ll make us S’mores if she’s not too sleepy and needs her Mommy Juice. Oh and I’ve got Mario Kart 8 Deluxe too, we can play!”


“Look I don’t really care about… literally any of that.” Jason said flatly, looking around the room apprehensively the whole while. “My brother went missing in Whitesville a few weeks ago along with two of his friends. I want answers for what happened to him and I want to bring him home safe. That’s all I give a shit about any of this.”


“Uhm…” Dev looked at the food and rubbed at his chin, trying to think of exactly how to go about what he needed to say next. “I know we haven’t known each other very long Jason, and you don’t really know whether to trust me yet or not but…”


Jason turned to face Dev, not saying anything but just showing he had his attention finally.


“Well…” Dev began again, then cleared his throat. “Gestalt.. Well… it doesn’t really take prisoners or anything. They kidnap people all the time but they… they turn them into those things. The cryptids.”


“The fuck are you saying to me right now?” Jason raised his shoulders up, his fists tightening at his sides a little and his entire body tensing.


“N-now let’s not resort to fisticuffs! I’m just the messenger!” Dev held his hands up to protect himself.


“Tell me what you got to tell me before I get REAL fuckin’ angry, Durwood!” Jason yelled, already obviously real fuckin’ angry.


CLANK!


The sound of metal hitting metal and reverberating through the room cut off the conversation. This kinda thing happens like every one of my stories, you should be used to it by now. But Jason and Dev weren’t, and both shot up straight with fear.


“Yo who the FUCK is there?!” Jason screamed out, his veins popping out of his neck from the raging strain at this point.


“Jason…?” a small voice flitted through the huge room, barely audible but still enough to send an immediate jolt of shock through Jason’s body. He took one step back, his hands dropping from fists at his side and his jaw dropping open.


“Who is…?” Dev muttered out, looking between Jason and where the voice had come from.


“I’ve been… I’ve been waiting for you to find me, Jason… I’ve been so scared…” the soft, small voice rode the wind to their ears and Jason began to shake slightly in place.

“It’s… it’s ok, man… you can come out. I’m here now, I’m not going anywhere, I’ve got you!” Jason called out with a newfound softness in his voice, walking toward the direction of the sound. Dev followed slowly behind, a deep feeling of unease welling up within his chest.


The two of them passed around the corner of one large set of shelves completely covered with animal carcasses, furs and taxidermied animals - several of them jauntily posed holding coffee cups in some kind of fucked up macabre marketing scheme long since abandoned by Uncle Otis.


But there beyond them, standing still in the middle of the aisle, was a young boy, no older than 12, wearing a little league baseball uniform with a windbreaker overtop of it, with dusty blonde hair dangling over his eyes loosely. He looked pleadingly toward Jason, tears in his eyes and his arm reaching for him.


“You finally found me…” the little boy said, holding back his tears.


“Archie… it’s my little brother Archie!” Jason let out an emotional outburst that wasn’t fueled by anger for once, immediately beginning to jog the distance between him and his little brother with a widening smile on his face.


Dev couldn’t help but notice, even through this beautiful familial reunion, that his feeling of unease hadn’t abated at all - it had grown exponentially the closer Jason got to Dev. 


And the light in the distance behind them had begun to flicker red.
