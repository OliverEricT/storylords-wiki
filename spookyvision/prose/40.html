<p>
	New York, New York, Winter 1934. Entry 11.
</p>
<p>
	It had been colder than a witches tit that winter and you could trust my first hand experience on the matter. I was freezing two different dudes’ balls off standing outside Lenny’s Bar two blocks over from the office trying to catch a cab for hours by the time I finally gave up and started hoofin’ it, so you could imagine what kinda mood was brewin’ in my abby-normal brain case.
</p>
<p>
	Imagine my surprise when I slumped down the alley to my busted up old office and found the front door wide open, a little slush from the night freeze tracked in on the welcome mat fresh. I thought for a couple seconds about whipping my gun out for safety but by this point my world famous even temper had boiled right over and I wanted to strangle somebody, so I didn’t bother.
</p>
<p>
	You might remember how well this attitude served me during my time trying to get my father figure to love me, so I was just hopeful that no one’s fiance, best friend, or sister happened to be waiting in my parlor that particular night.
</p>
<p>
	The light in my office was burning dimly just past the empty reception desk, so I just sloughed my way back there like I owned the place, since I did. I turned the lamp on by the door as I stepped inside and no one and nothing made a move in the newly brightly lit room, so I went about heading to my desk like I always did. Figured playing along would be best for now.
</p>
<p>
	I was surprised after taking my seat to find myself eye to eye with a tiny old man sitting in the lounge chair across from me. He was a man of dark complexion with deeply set eyes which still burned with a youthful vigor that belied his true age - which honestly I probably woulda put somewhere in the early 200’s. You gotta understand, this fellas face looked like the Aggro Crag without any of the back-lighting, just hundreds upon hundreds of wrinkles and deep lines criss-crossing his ancient visage like a drawing of a man that had been scribbled out by time and trial. So kinda like Martin Landau used to look, but younger.
</p>
<p>
	“Uh…hello?” I asked the old man, who folded his short, thick arms over his chest and lowered his gaze at me.
</p>
<p>
	“You are Adam Frankenstein?” he asked plainly in an accent I couldn’t particularly place so I won’t be trying to duplicate it, fuck you if you were waiting for it. 
</p>
<p>
	I took my time answering that though, sitting back into my seat and surveying the little old man. He wore a dingy white captains hat low on his brow and had a beard very much the same color which twisted this way and that beneath his nose, nearly hiding his mouth completely until he spoke. A wide collared woolen jacket framed him like a young boy wearing his father’s best fishing wear, and a pair of white slacks flowed off of him just as loosely over his penny loafers. He couldn’t have been more of a sailor if he was shoving spinach down his throat and battering Bluto.
</p>
<p>
	“That’s what I hear.” I finally answered cooly, tapping a finger on the desk between us. “It really depends on who’s doing the asking.”
</p>
<p>
	“I am Nemo. Captain of a barge docked in the Hudson Bay at the moment, and in need of the aid of a smart, capable man.” the old sea dog reached a boney, shaking hand into his overcoat and returned with a small wooden smoking pipe, which he tapped onto the butt of his hand.
</p>
<p>
	“You oughta take that up with the boys at the dock. I’m a private eye, not a deckhand.” I couldn’t help but notice the man put no tobacco in his pipe at all, he just placed its spout to his lips and left it rest there, dangling from the edge of his droopy lip.
</p>
<p>
	“I seek no mate to aid me on the sea. I live my life upon her waves and have supped at the freedom she grants all my years and shall continue to until all the breath is spent in this world-weary vessel I drag from port to port hereafter. I am master of these oceans and so have tamed them to my very will and you find me lacking simply by sight. I thought you a smarter man from your reputation, Frankenstein.” The old man sat up a little in his chair, the burning spark in his eyes dancing in the phosphorescent light of my office. “I seek aid upon this wretched land, from which I have recoiled in disgust these long years. A land of tyranny and oppression from which the only respite is death or the bitter salt of the waves themselves. This horrid land of yours is from whence I falter, and ONLY from whence, I assure you.”
</p>
<p>
	“Who the FUCK referred you to me?” I couldn’t help but stammer out after that fucking Shakespeare in the Park production.
</p>
<p>
	He ignored me entirely, reaching back into his overcoat and retrieving what could only be described as a fucking Titanic wad of bills wrapped up with a rubber band. He labored in tossing it on the desk between us, the hulking mass of moolah rolling quaintly over the old wrinkled writing pad advertising window repair and a burger joint across town that had lain on my desk since I’d moved into this dump to begin with.
</p>
<p>
	“One thousand dollars. Up front.” Nemo hissed through his time-inked old teeth, his words echoing on the wind to my ears.
</p>
<p>
	I reached out almost in a stupor of disbelief at that amount of money laying on MY desk, in MY shitty office, within MY greasy reach. My fingers pressed against the top of the roll and it compressed from my touch. This was real American currency alright, and it was a shit ton of it. I almost jumped up and clicked my godamn heels to say yes but I was struck by the kind of job someone might want a man to do for this much money and snapped to my senses.
</p>
<p>
	I’m not trynna fuck an old ass man, even for $1000, is what I’m saying.
</p>
<p>
	“What’s the job, then?” I tried to clear the excitement out of my throat at the cash prize at the end of the tunnel, as well as the apprehension in whether or not this old geezer wanted me to try to crank start his Model T at age 150.
</p>
<p>
	Nemo seemed to come alive at the prospect of my agreement to his employ, sitting upright for the first time since arriving. He steepled his fingers and focused his fiery dark eyes upon me as he spoke, “There is a… creature that I have tracked far and wide across the never-ending blue. Goliath in stature and more powerful than any sea creature I have ever had the honor to witness in my century of endeavor. It can rend a ship apart like a man can pull apart bread and destroy a fleet almost as easily. There is no escaping its wrath should it focus it’s hatred upon you, and it has obliterated entire civilizations under the weight of that same rage.” 
</p>
<p>
	I can’t lie to you folks, I was straight up god damn enthralled by this point. There’s somethin about an old ass pop-pop tellin’ a story that really puts you on the edge of your seat, ain’t there? Well I assume anyway, I never really had a pop-pop. I caused Victor’s dad to die of grief or some shit so he didn’t really count.
</p>
<p>
	Nemo continued, unabated. “This creature I have chased from one corner of the oceans to the other, and finally have it cornered. But there couldn’t have been a worse place for it to roost itself to escape my hand. It somehow writhed its massive form into the Hudson River and has coiled itself deep amongst it’s winding routes. This beast is unstoppable, untouchable by mortal hands for a millenia… this BEAST…. The KRAKEN.”
</p>
<p>
	Now you know me, I’m a skeptic until it’s impossible to be one anymore, but you also know me well enough to know a thousand dollars would buy a LOT of booze, so I just went along with it. I snatched up the roll of bills and tucked it into my top right desk drawer, sealing it shut with the key and pocketing it. “I gotta admit, Captain, I still don’t really know what you want me to do about it. But this sounds like a legitimate job for the price so far. You wanna at least give me some specifics along with the nice storytime?”
</p>
<p>
	The old man smiled a crooked, aged smile, a glint of malice in it that set me on edge suddenly. He leaned forward in his seat and gripped at the arm rests as he hissed out a whisper to me once more, “I want you to draw it out. The beast refuses to surface when my ship is about, but if you can locate it then I will be able to resume the chase with your reconnaissance. I have heard you are a man who can find anything, assuming it is horrid and ungodly as yourself.”
</p>
<p>
	“Ouch.” I mumbled. “Not incorrect, though.”
</p>
<p>
	“Excellent.” Nemo said to seemingly no one, standing up and straightening out his overcoat over his frail, thin body. He smiled a more cordial smile now, the wrinkles at the edge of his eyes deepening to Marianas Trench levels as he did. “I am currently at residence at the Plaza Historia Hotel, room 214. I assume you know the location. I will be expecting your information to be delivered to me there before sun-up this morning. You have 6 hours, Frankenstein. Do not disappoint me. Few who ever have would recommend it.”
</p>
<p>
	I stood to move around the desk and shake this decrepit old sack of shit’s hand but by the time I’d stooped up out of the seat he was walking out the front door of the office and into the cold night’s air, disappearing beyond the single street light which hung low outside the building. 
</p>
<p>
	I was suddenly struck with what a stupid fucking deal I’d just made. I didn’t know a damn thing about this old bilge sucker - who sent him, his actual business with this creature, hell even what his fucking first name happened to be. I slapped my own forehead the instant I was suddenly hit with the realization I didn’t even ask this guy what the fucking Kraken was or what it happened to look like. Was it like a big ass squid like from the myths or what? It had been a LONG ass time since I’d read The Odyssey, favorite of mine as it was.
</p>
<p>
	I got this inkling feeling in my stomach as I closed up shop and headed out into the night on my newest high price wild goose chase that I was overlooking something pretty big. Why did the name Nemo sound so familiar to me, anyway?
</p>
<p>
	—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	So there I was, yet again trawling around the docks in the middle of the night trying my best to blend in with fuckin’ nobody cause no one was around this time of night except night freaks like myself. The sting of the salt on air messed with my nose and I kept having the feeling like I was gonna sneeze but I never did which is enough to drive a man fuckin’ crazy all it’s own - let alone the horrific trauma of being a dozen corpses stitched together and brought to life through unknowable alchemy by a cold, unloving young scientist who desires only the destruction and deletion of what he considers the greatest affront to God ever birthed into this world. Or maybe seasonal allergies, I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
	I was pulling my fur collar up tight around my neck to keep the cold at bay when I finally arrived at the actual edge of the bay. There was a large wooden slat fence that towered even over me in the night running from one end of the dock to the next at this point, meant to keep the riff-raff out at night - a group which I was then currently the riffiest and raffiest of. More interestingly though, the gigantic fence seemed to have been plastered from one end to the next with graffiti, each piece more intricate and fanciful than the last. Which was pretty fuckin’ wild considering spray paint wouldn’t be invented for another six years. Just try not to think about that though I guess.
</p>
<p>
	I perused the designs for a long while, feeling completely directionless and particularly rudderless standing under the dim light of a busted old street lamp in the middle of the night without a clue what the hell I was supposed to be doing. 
</p>
<p>
	By the time I’d finished my second cigarette it has started to drizzle rain and I finally noticed a pattern in some of this nonsense that had completely eluded me up until that moment. At the end of several pieces, one after another, was an arrow with a small black mark on it pointing straight to the next one. I said to myself, hey fuck it right? May as well make a night of this horse shit and see where it takes me. I followed the direction they were pointing down the fence, from one arrow to the next. And no matter how far I walked without seeing another arrow, inevitably I ran into one after a while that continued pointing me down the pier. 
</p>
<p>
	Finally I came face to face with what all the hooplah happened to be about - a small hole just big enough for a young kid to slip through with a bunch of arrows pointing at it, each one with a small black dot on it. Fucking hell, I didn’t even think I could fit my DICK through that shit, let alone get to the other side in any way. I was back at square one and was pushing 3am already. 
</p>
<p>
	“You gotta be bustin’ my balls…” I whispered under my breath, not expecting an answer from the darkness around me. But I got one anyway.
</p>
<p>
	“Not if you do exactly what we tell you to do.” a brazen voice filtered from the darkness. Several flashlights clicked on all at once, pointing at me from every side and sizing me up and down. From the center of them a tall, thin young man wearing a heavy suede jacket and slouched newsboy cap stepped up, pointing a flashlight as his own face. “We can be miiiiiighty friendly, if you cooperate nice and slow.”
</p>
<p>
	There was a shower of pubescent giggles and titters from the darkness around me and I couldn’t help but shake my head in disappointment. “You little cumstains should probably rethink this entire enterprise and head on home to your mothers. I’m not usually one to bash the brains out of schoolkids but I’ve had a LOUSY night.”
</p>
<p>
	“We ain’t schoolkids, you disgusting old freak!” a different voice yelled from the inky blackness behind the flashing blinding lights all around me, just as youthful and new as the others. “We’re college men, ain’t that right boys?!”
</p>
<p>
	They all cheered at once but something caught my attention during the booming sound - an unmistakable metallic click. I bolted immediately toward the sound, like a rocket from a silo, and threw a wild haymaker into the darkness, just above one of the bobbing flashlights in my eyes. I felt bone splinter beneath my strike and the give of a body flying away from my blow. There was a flash of bright light and the smell of smoke in the air as the gun hit the ground and went off, one of the other boys yowling in pain in the night. 
</p>
<p>
	By now most of the flashlights had hit the ground or were swinging toward the direction the voice had screamed from and I could finally see clearly enough in the dark to see what I was up against. Four men still stood and they were stirred up like an angry beehive that I’d made the first move. Little Jimmy who got shot was laying on the ground holding his knee where the bullet had gone in, yowling at the top of his lungs, so I considered him fucked enough to not beat on going forward.
</p>
<p>
	Loudmouth Billy, the leader of the bunch in the slouched newsboy cap, got it next. I saw him fumbling for something in his jacket and bumrushed him as well. I grabbed him by his lapels and swung him like a battering ram into one of his esteemed colleagues - sending the other guy sailing away into the dirt in the distance from the force. Billy himself I just heaved at the old wooden fence itself.
</p>
<p>
	Now I’m not a big believer in luck or serendipity or any of that other shit people who aren’t fucked up freaks believe in, but somebody musta been watching for me that night cause ol’ Billy’s body went straight through that part of the fence like it was made of ticker tape - splintering the wood off clean and wide as he sailed through.
</p>
<p>
	I managed to nab one of the other two by the collar and fling him through the open hole as well just before the last guy hoofed it the hell out of dodge so he didn’t get manapulted through a fence too.
</p>
<p>
	I stepped through to the other side, finding myself on a small little private dock with an old dinghy docked at its end. Mission accomplished! I made it to the other side! Now the fuck what? I still didn’t know a Kraken from my ass from a hole in the ground and had no clue where to even start searching for it from the surface when it was underwater. Or I at least fucking ASSUMED it was underwater? Man waving a thousand bucks in somebody's face really makes them not ask any god damn questions, huh?
</p>
<p>
	Just about then one of the troubled youths slammed me in the back of the head with a huge piece of the broken fence, which cracked in half against my big ass skull and splintered everywhere. I stood motionless for a moment before slowly turning and staring down at the kid, in what I could only assume wasn’t the first moment this kid ever shit himself but it was probably the worst.
</p>
<p>
	He turned and tried to run but I grabbed him under his armpits and raised him up into the air like a baby, snarling directly in his face like the eloquent gentleman I am before heaving him like a sack of potatoes straight over the dock and into the water below. Sploosh. He was under pretty immediately.
</p>
<p>
	“KEN CAN’T SWIM! FUCK! FUCK!” Loudmouth Billy began to scream, staggering up to his feet with shards of wood sticking out of him here and there from his trip through the fence.
</p>
<p>
	“Not really seeing how his lack of athletics is my problem.” I snorted out, doing my most menacing walk toward the remaining street tough before me. I clenched my fists, debating with myself whether I should just let him go or if I should Rock-Em Sock-Em Robots his head off his shoulders and see if I can beat my high score for height.
</p>
<p>
	An ear-piercing screaming broke us both out of the reverie though. We turned eyes toward the water and there was Ken, bobbing up to the surface just long enough to show his entire upper body was burned across with gigantic circular shapes which seemed to eat into his flesh like acid, his screams loud enough to pierce my ear drums and cause me to recoil - then he was back under the water.
</p>
<p>
	And then there was a big slowly expanding pool of red in the drink where he’d been before.
</p>
<p>
	And then there was silence. For a second or two anyway.
</p>
<p>
	Loudmouth Billy began screaming with his loud ass fucking mouth, running along the dock back toward the hole in the fence with all his might. I just stood there and watched him, honestly kind of shell-shocked at how quickly this night had escalated from the wild goose chase I’d been on since midnight.
</p>
<p>
	Now imagine how much worse that feeling got when a gigantic slimy white tentacle shot out of the water like a torpedo and snatched that kid right the fuck up off the dock the instant before he could make it to the fence. 
</p>
<p>
	It was like an elastic band with how quickly it snapped back into the water, dragging the helpless underachiever under the waves to meet a grisly death that I couldn’t see in the darkness below the water and also honestly couldn’t be bothered to give a flying fuck about if you paid me.
</p>
<p>
	It did make me realize that standing still was what was saving my life, such as it is, at that moment. The kid thrashing in the water attracted it to begin with, and the other moron running away screaming is what kept it around so staying stock-still was my only option for the moment.
</p>
<p>
	You might have realized the problem with this plan about the same time I did at this point - there’s no telling how long I’d have to stand there like the world’s ugliest most giant mannequin before this Japanese schoolgirl’s worst nightmare got bored and took off for the night - and I was on a pretty strict deadline to report back to Nemo with this location. A conundrum I genuinely didn’t have an answer for.
</p>
<p>
	Not that that ever stops me from making a move, mind you.
</p>
<p>
	I settled on a kinda awkward, slow shimmy kinda walk across the dock, the kinda tip-toeing twinkle-toes ass sneak you do when you’re tryin to get a peak at your Christmas presents before your parents wake up. Again, I assume, I’ve never known love.
</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, every time my foot touched the planks of the dock the old wet wood let out a creaking moan loud enough to put your whore ass mother’s screaming moans to shame when I’m docking her with my old wet wood. Docking doesn’t mean the same thing in whatever time period I’m writing this from, it means I fucked your mother and she was loud.
</p>
<p>
	I guess by this point the Kraken had gotten pretty tired of the slow teasing, very much like your whore mother, and decided to pop up to the surface and find out what the fuck was going on with the third course of it’s dinner.
</p>
<p>
	The amount of water the thing displaced as it surfaced woulda blown your fuckin mind, man. It was like a tidal wave that wouldn’t stop growing. I gave up trying to be sneaky and just started fuckin hoofing it myself back toward the hole in the fence, more scared I was gonna drown than any huge monster was gonna pulp me at that point.
</p>
<p>
	But it was really no use, I’m pretty quick for a bunch of dead guys but there’s no outruning a tsunami. The wall of water smashed into me and sent me grinding along every stone and gravel bit on the ground before depositing me against an unbroken portion of the fence twenty or thirty feet down the peer, twisted up like a gross dead flesh pretzel and wet as your whore momma gets when I show her my big ass dead flesh DICK. It works. 
</p>
<p>
	By the time I’d gotten my eyes to finally open from the sting of the water I was met with a sight unlike any I’d seen in all my days which is fuckin’ saying something since I own a mirror. A twenty foot tall fucking squid lumbered up out of the water, it’s innumerable appendages flailing through the air and smashing down into nearby boats like a hot knife through butter. It squeeled out a horrific call like nothing I’d ever heard before either, since I don’t own a tape recorded. 
</p>
<p>
	“WHAT THE FUCK?!” I managed to scream out before one of the massive tentacles came lashing at me, wrapping around my body like a kid picking up a fucking Frankenstein action figure which would be a GREAT idea for the podcasts fellas, think about it. I got lifted so high into the air I resigned myself to the face I’d break apart like a jigsaw puzzle if I ever got let go. The height was dizzying as it swayed its gross ass tentacle meat back and forth through the air, bobbing me this way and that as it moved.
</p>
<p>
	SMASH!! The thing bashed me into the side of an old steel tub of a boat and my body went through it the hard way. The tentacle did most of the smashing, but the steel still scraped along my skin like a meat grinder, flaying my clothes at every end and leaving me looking like I was wearing underwear and a suit made of linen spaghetti when it yanked me back out the same way. I was screaming and you woulda been too, fuck you if you’re judging.
</p>
<p>
	The rain had begun to pour like a violent deluge at this point, lightning streaking across the night’s sky and causing the already violent waves below to become unbelievably choppy and wild.
</p>
<p>
	“I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NEVER FIND IT, DETECTIVE!” a booming hollow voice like from a PA announcement cut through the pain and awakened my senses back from the pain for that moment, my blurry vision coming together just enough to peer through the darkness in the direction it had been bidden.
</p>
<p>
	Another gigantic shape raised up from the Hudson, shifting water like a storm and splaying it’s body out onto the surface of the dark water. But this shape was entirely steel and iron, wrought with bronze and gold across its surface. It was the most magnificent thing that I’d ever laid my eyes on and I’ve seen your mama’s nasty backmeats ready and waiting for any and all comers - and I do mean comers. 
</p>
<p>
	The thing wasn’t a boat, it had come from BENEATH the water! It was a god damn submarine and it was beautiful beyond all compare! The mechanical monstrosity queued up in front of the giant beast, the front of it being pockmarked with holes that slowly widened through telephoto scoping, revealing pointed golden-tipped barbs beneath their surface. A gigantic bullhorn atop the front of the submarine began to screech and that same voice came filtered from within it.
</p>
<p>
	“This beast is no prey, Frankenstein! It is the answer to all my prayers! The final solution to the only problem of this world that has ever truly mattered!” the machinery inside the dozens upon dozens of holes began to whir to life as he continued. “The tyrannical oppression of colonial powers are finally going to be put asunder, Detective! The powers that be will buckle before the true awesome might of the sea, of the Kraken! We will wipe all of your super powered militaries off the face of this earth and the oppressed will no longer live below your bootheel! So sayeth Nemo, Captain of the Unsinkable Nautilus!”
</p>
<p>
	Each hole, now a tube with a sharp spear within it, then fired off into the cold night air - trailed behind by the end of the biggest fuck-off huge net I’ve ever seen in all my life. Like this shit was big as YOU KNOW WHO’S NASTY ASS YOU KNOW WHAT, son. I might be your father, who knows.
</p>
<p>
	The net encompassed the gigantic beast like it had been made for its proportions exactly, each gold-tipped spike wrapping around the back of the beast and intertwining with the net without piercing its flesh even once. This had the unfortunate side-effect of trapping me inside the net as well, but it didn’t seem like that was gonna bother Nemo very much.
</p>
<p>
	The Kraken, for its part, was now splaying its gigantic tentacles from one side of the river to the other, it’s massive arms smashing into not only boats but now buildings and yanking back away toward the bridge in the distance. I peered back toward the bridge as best I could and could see small lights traveling serenly from one side to other like there wasn’t a fucking Timely Comics super beat-em-up happening in the water below them. 
</p>
<p>
	“FUCK ME!” I screamed out, grasping onto either side of the tentacle that held me in place and pushing with every bit of my might. I was straining harder than when I ate that entire block of cheese and just like that night, nothing was budging. The thing had a grip tighter than a vice on me and I couldn’t seem to budge it. 
</p>
<p>
	But I did finally get a clear head enough to get an idea. I maneuvered my arm well enough to reach into my overcoat, and retrieve the 357 magnum pistol from within it. I pointed it haphazardly at the white slimy flesh of my prison and let loose the entire fucking clip. The goliath calimari screeched out loud at what must have been the equivalent of someone stabbing you with a bobby pin and loosened its grip just enough for me to squirrel my way out of its grasp.
</p>
<p>
	I was a little struck in that moment by the fact I was now riding on top of a gigantic undulating squid tentacle like the world’s most disgusting surfer in the middle of the bay. It was a pretty weird night, looking back on it.
</p>
<p>
	Still I cupped my hands to my mouth and screamed out as best I could, “NEMO!! YOU’RE GOING TO KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE! PULL IT BACK!” but my voice didn’t carry with the carnage going on, and we were getting dangerously close to the George Washington Bridge by then.
</p>
<p>
	I looked back up at the Kraken and saw it focusing its attention of the massive submarine that Nemo had called the Nautilus and suddenly got the dumbest idea I’ve ever had in my entire fucking life then. And I’ve had some doozies. 
</p>
<p>
	I took a running leap off the tentacle I’d been trying to stay steady on for less than a minute by that point and felt myself falling in that nightmare way that makes you feel sure you’re going to die when you land. But instead of meeting my maker’s maker I split the water and dove right under, massive pillars of white squid flesh passing me by as they undulated below the river to keep the beast afloat above. 
</p>
<p>
	I’ve never been the best swimmer in the world but it’s wild how much you can accomplish with a determined doggy paddle when you have no other choice. I crested the water and horked up a bunch of bay blork back into the water, tasting the distinct flavor of burnt ready-made pizza in a way that I very much didn’t like but put out of my mind. I fumbled around at the surface to stay afloat long enough to latch a hand around the huge netting which had trapped the Kraken, using it to hoist my body up out of the water and begin to climb the fifty foot tall monstrosity. 
</p>
<p>
	Nemo, for his part, was straining the engines of the Nautilus to try and drag the netting back in towards its hull. There were dozens of men that I could see lining the decks on the side and top of the sea machine with massive nets draped between them to further ensnare the kraken once it got close enough, but the beast was fighting so hard and trashing away so violently it was putting distance between itself and the ship the entire time. 
</p>
<p>
	I couldn’t help but wonder what kinda dental and vision benefits that old psychopath must be giving out to have an entire crew of flunkies out here in the middle of the night in the pouring rain trying to capture the world’s largest and most violent squid. Must’ve been pretty primo.
</p>
<p>
	But I was preoccupied with stage two of my brilliant and daring plan to get myself killed and hopefully save a bridge full of only-slightly evil New York motorists. Near the tip top of the squid’s towering body, I wrenched my hands through the criss-crossing of wires and rope and managed to find the end cap of one of those long, spiked spears at the end of one of the lines. I wedged my feet into the old hempen rope criss-crossed beneath me and yanked back as hard as I could, again straining like there was no tomorrow, just like when I tried not to blow a load in your mama so hard that her head popped off like a cork gun. 
</p>
<p>
	POP! The spear dislodged from the rope and wire around it and I almost fell off the squid like the dumb fucking moron I am. Thankfully, the rope was still attached to the spear and me almost falling pulled it taut enough to catch me. I breathed a sign of relief at my own dumb luck and went back to climbing, the massive spear tip tucked under my arm dragging the line behind it.
</p>
<p>
	“STOP RESISTING ME, BEAST! We will rid this world of its horrid captors, its colonial masters! We will bring a future where no one fears the tyranny and violence of those old decrepit houses ever again! WE WILL BE THE ADJUDICATORS OF A NEW ERA!” Nemo screamed through his massive bullhorn PR machine, his tinny voice echoing through the raging rainstorm but somehow not reaching the heart of the giant dumb sea creature with no ears. Go figure.
</p>
<p>
	A new set of Nemo’s flunkies appeared on the decks above board, each set of two of them carrying small mortars and setting them up on the decks for firing. I’m not Mr. Military Expertise or anything over here, I learned how to read in a fucking peasant family’s basement after all, but even I know they weren’t gonna be able to get the firing charges lit on those fuckers in this kinda weather, but they toiled away anyway.
</p>
<p>
	By this point I’d managed to make it to the top of the squid’s violently trashing body, trying my hardest to keep my footing on it’s disgusting drenched skin and mostly doing a very bad job. I grasped the spear tip with both hands and yanked the rope back from it, wrapping it around the blunt end of the spear until it was completely taut once more. 
</p>
<p>
	“Jesus fuck…. Well…. God…. fuck you, I guess. This life fucking sucked dick. Thanks for nothing.” I muttered mostly to myself. Then I jumped.
</p>
<p>
	The plan worked beautifully, honestly. The rope was taut enough that I swung right back down toward the Kraken after my jump. And the angle was decent enough too - I didn’t swing in as high as I hoped I would but I still managed to basically hit the very center of one of it’s massive bulbous eyes. The razor sharp tip of the gigantic gold-edged spear slid right into the jelly of that massive eye like a key into a lock, sending waves of black and red ooze surging out of it by the liter into the open night’s sky.
</p>
<p>
	The Kraken roared a horrific, stunted roar that shattered windows for blocks on either side of the river, and busted the fuck out of my ear drums. The creature’s wails trailed off after a few moments of me dangling from it’s eyeball by a spire, and it’s body slowly, soggily slumped over into the net, being steadily dragged along the surface of the river lifelessly by the Nautilus’ mechanical retrieval of the net around it.
</p>
<p>
	“Holy fucking shit…! I’m ALIVE! I’M ALIVE!” I screamed, unaware of the irony of yelling that about Frankenstein’s Monster just yet.
</p>
<p>
	Having lived to fuck around and find out another day, I got the flying fuck out of there while the getting was good. I dropped into the bay and swam the fuck back toward the river bank to hoof it on home on my own good time.
</p>
<p>
	—---------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	The fishy smell was stomach turning and seemed like it was gonna last forever as I finally slipped back into my run-down old office in Brooklyn. The lights were off inside and no door was left open. I took both of these things as a good sign.
</p>
<p>
	I took my time coming in this time, didn’t bother going to my office right away. I slipped into a pair of my old pajamas and tossed pretty much my entire outfit since it had been shredded up like mozzarella by the fight with The Kraken. My jacket survived pretty nicely though, just had to patch it up in some places.
</p>
<p>
	After about an hour of being at home, showering in my apartment upstairs, changing, having a cigarette on the fire escape and taking the world’s longest after-pool piss, I decided it was time to count my earnings and have a belt of whiskey before turning in for the night. Well, morning at this point.
</p>
<p>
	I walked into the office and flicked the hall light on, not bothering with either of the lamps inside, and made the short walk over to my desk, and flopped down. The instant my fingers touched the top right drawer of my desk, I could tell it was ajar. Unlocked and opened.
</p>
<p>
	“Now taking away my pay seems like a pretty rotten trick.” I hissed into the darkness, my attitude about as bad as my odor at this point. “I did exactly what you asked me to do.”
</p>
<p>
	“You have ruined me, Frankenstein. The Kraken was my last chance on this Earth to finally stop the tyranny at play amongst your countries, your millionaires and their toy armies.” A small light flickered, a match lighting the end of a pipe. I could see Nemo’s face pock-marked and etched with age glaring at me from behind the backlit smoke every time he puffed at it. “You must be a soldier of fascism and colonial interests yourself.”
</p>
<p>
	“I couldn’t give less of a shit, honestly.” I muttered as I leaned back into my chair. “I’d be happy if your enemies all died a horrible Kraken-related death tomorrow, honestly. Hell, the world would be a much better place because of it.”
</p>
<p>
	“Then WHY did you stop me?!” The old man slammed a fist down into the arm of the lounge chair across from me, his teeth gnashing in his head. “The Kraken is DEAD! I am now too old and close to death to EVER make the difference I set out to accomplish after I faked my death!”
</p>
<p>
	“You crossed the wrong fuckin’ group of corpses, mac, what can I tell ya? Not to mention you were killing a whole bunch of innocent people in my city who never colonized or fascismed a godamn thing in their lives. The bridge was gonna go down and hundreds more were gonna die. You shoulda kept your god damn fish hunt out of my city.” I reached down into the bottom right hand of my desk and retrieved the half-drunk bottle of whiskey, uncapping it and downing a slug to calm my growing rage.
</p>
<p>
	Nemo sat silently for a moment. I sat silently there with him.
</p>
<p>
	After a long, hanging moment, I dipped my hand back into the bottom right desk drawer and returned with two small crystalline drink glasses. I placed one on the desk in front of him and poured a slug into it for him, then one into the glass in front of me.
</p>
<p>
	Nemo watched without saying a word, but immediately picked up his glass when it was ready. The both of us downed our drinks together, and sat the glasses back onto the desk between us.
</p>
<p>
	Another moment of silence hung in the air.
</p>
<p>
	“You gonna come looking for revenge against me, Nemo?” I asked plainly, tapping my thumbnail against my glass.
</p>
<p>
	“No.” He said just as plainly in return. “I am a very old man, now. It is for younger men to carry on legacies and vengeances. There will be someone to take my place someday. But I don’t believe they’ll ever know your name.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m thankful for small miracles.” I muttered, filling up the glasses once more with what little remained of the whiskey bottle.
</p>
<p>
	We drank in silence once again and returned the glasses between us.
</p>
<p>
	“You do have something to worry about though, creature.” Nemo spoke in a gravely weak old voice that did not fit him. “The man who referred me to you has a desire for your death that will not be quenched through natural means.”
</p>
<p>
	“What…?” That caught my attention. I stared hard through the darkness in the room at his barely lit eyes as he spoke. “Who?”
</p>
<p>
	“Beware the Triple Six Society. That is all I can say to you now.” Nemo stood up, still looking as old and jagged as any craggy outcropping of stone on the sea. And he was gone. 
</p>
<p>
	I never saw him again. Never learned his story. Never had another run-in with any of his crew, nor any successor. It was one of the strangest nights of my entire godforsaken life.
</p>
<p>
	What’s the moral of the story this time? That’s easy as pie this time around - don’t let a big wad of money cloud your better judgement. Sometimes there’s no amount of money that’s gonna be worth the headache of earning it. Especially if you end up empty handed at the end of the day regardless.
</p>
<p>
	Oh, eventually I did remember what I’d forgotten about the name Nemo. It comes from The Odyssey, is the irony of it all. Odysseus uses it to disguise his true name and purpose to the Cyclops. 
</p>
<p>
	It means “No One.”
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
