	Last Time… on Saga of The Cricket Man:
</p>
<p>
	Ryo Tachibana has had a pretty fucked up couple of days, all things considered. A few days ago he was kidnapped from the university he works at as a teaching assistant - I think I called it Henderson University as a joke or something so I guess that’s canon now. Smart writing. The kidnapper? A man’s lifeless corpse hanging from a bunch of gigantic horrific spiders legs. Try saying my fucking stories aren’t scary NOW, arachnophobes. Shit’s terrifying.
</p>
<p>
	Anyway, he awoke to find himself being experimented on by masked men in a dark room and was only saved from this living tortuous hell by the professor he worked for showing up and saving him. Which was pretty cool of him, except for the fact that the Professor is the one that sold Ryo out to this evil shadowy organization called Gestalt to begin with. So fuck that guy. He got murdered by a bat monster in the night during their escape anyway. RIP in pieces, Professor Dipshit.
</p>
<p>
	When his back was against the wall, Ryo horrifically transformed into an incredibly powerful insectoid horror, which overpowered the spider monster and violently dismembered it before escaping. He awoke, human again for all intents and purposes, naked on a small boat in the middle of a lake headed very slowly back to civilization - aware and terrified of what he had become.
</p>
<p>
	And now… the continuation.
</p>
<p>
	Ryo had found himself with a brand new set of problems he had never faced before in his life. Sure, he was an eldritch abomination trapped within a suit of human flesh now, masquerading as a human being, perhaps devoid of the very essence of what it means to be one forever - but more pressingly he was having to duck through peoples back yards across the suburbs in nothing but his skin suit, dick n’ balls floppin’ and weavin in the breeze as free as the day he was born, but much lower.
</p>
<p>
	Once he had made it to shore in the boat he quickly realized the small dock, the only one he’d been able to find in the early morning haze, was in some fuckers back yard - and every time he managed to hop another fence, what was waiting for him? Another fucking back yard - sometimes with screaming people in it yelling stuff like “HOLY SHIT A GUY’S DICK IS HERE!” and “WOWEE ZOWEE A NAKED MAN JUST FOR ME?!”
</p>
<p>
	And you know what he never found once? A fucking clothesline with a full drying outfit on it in his exact fucking size, because it’s not the 1950’s and I’m not as fucking hack as the writer or director of Man of Steel. Are you fucking kidding me with that shit? Jesus christ. If you got some shit to say about anything I write in this episode then fucking hit me up, bitch-tits. I’m ready and waiting to feed you my ass and show you what’s what, drop me a fucking line. The email address is Toonhounds@gmail.com.
</p>
<p>
	Just as inexplicably as Man of Steel however, he eventually leapt over a fence and crossed the street hastily into a small park where a Scottish Heritage Festival was going on. Skulking around the tree-line he was just capable of darting out and snatching a kilt from the supply behind a vendor’s booth near the outskirts called “Skirt It!.” There was a picture of two bald guys faces embroidered onto the front of it that he didn’t recognize, but at this point beggars couldn’t be choosers. Now we’re fuckin writing good for a change.
</p>
<p>
	Luckily everyone at the festival was distracted from his rolicking naked comedy antics by a free concert being put on by a scottish folk band called Celtic-Tick-Boom that mostly did bagpipe covers of The Hives and the soundtrack from that one movie starring Andrew Garfield that has the same name as the song that came up when I googled this.
</p>
<p>
	While sneaking around back behind the booths looking for a t-shirt in his size he only found two shirts that fit the bill - a Blue Lives Matter shirt and a band shirt for a local band called “Dogfucker” that had a picture of a cartoon man fucking a dog on it. Naturally, given he had to walk through public and be around other human beings with a sense of decorum who would be disgusted by a degenerate, disgusting t-shirt he opted to wear the Dogfucker one.
</p>
<p>
	Let me tell you, it was one long, awkward, painful walk through the dog park back to his mom’s house that day. But even if he would have remembered that she lived right next to the dog park, he still would have rather just continued on naked than ever show solidarity with the fascist occupying army that is the police force - ACAB, Fuck 12, Cops are Pigs, Defund the Police.
</p>
<p>
	When he arrived out front of his mom’s quaint little suburban home, he felt the tension he’d been holding in every fiber of his body slowly start to melt away. The feeling of home flowed over him like a warm, cleansing shower and washed away the fear and pain he had been trapped within.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m home…” he whispered under his breath, the sound of his own voice coming out of his mouth just as it always had being a comfort unto itself.
</p>
<p>
	He snuck around the side of the house, being especially thankful that his uncle Hiroshi had left his disgusting old van which he called “The Love Machine” parked in the driveway here for the past 20 years. It had been creepy then, since it was 2003 and you were thinking of like the 80’s or something you old fuck, but god was it even more creepy now. But it made perfect cover to get to the back door of the house unseen around the side of the garage.
</p>
<p>
	He fiddled around under the fake rocks that lined the walkway to the back door until he stumbled onto the right one, slipping an old rusty silver key out from under it and unlocking the back door with it. He slid inside, as stealthily as he could, pushing the door to behind him with held breath. He was suddenly reminded of sneaking back in this way every saturday evening during high school, trying not to get caught coming back from Becky Alderson’s wet tonguing parties. Those were the days. And it looked like he hadn’t lost a step - having made it in completely unnoticed.
</p>
<p>
	“PUT YER HANDS UP, STREET TRASH, I GOT A UZI!!” a voice exploded out of the hallway behind him, causing him to spin around and throw his hands up into the air.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh gahd, Ryo! Sweetiepie! I didn’t know you were coming home for the weekend! I don’t got an uzi, don’t worry it’s just a can of Pillsbury dough mix and a banana!” Ryo’s mom stood in the hallway holding a small linen towel over top of a gun-shaped mass which she revealed as the exact items she described, stacked on each other to make a pretty realistic looking uzi all things said.
</p>
<p>
	She stood about 5 feet tall flat, with a pair of fluffy house shoes, sweatpants, and a flowery print blouse with a ruffle at the sleeve. She had a pair of oversized glasses perched on her nose and far more gray hair than black, the very picture of a sweet little old lady, but not too old, she’d remind you! She’s still in her prime.
</p>
<p>
	“Mom, you about gave me a heart attack!” Ryo grimaced, holding his hand to his chest - half to mime the heart attack and half to cover the picture of the guy fucking the dog as best he could. The words were too big to do anything to hide.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, I’m sorry, sweetheart, you know how dangerous this neighborhood is getting lately! The news is even talkin about a streaker runnin around peoples backyards showin buns and who KNOWS what else!” She placed the fake uzi ingredients down on the counter and walked over to the fridge, opening it up and rummaging around inside. “You want a pop, hunny?”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh no, Mom, thanks… I just stopped by to pick up some of my stuff, I think.” Ryo’s eyes darted over toward the stairs up to his room, inching away from the door toward them to try and make a bit of a break for it.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh now nonsense, sweetie! You’re a growin’ boy, you need your pop!” His mom spun around holding two cokes in her hands and tilted her head looking at his shirt. “Dogfuh…oh good golly, good lord, Ryo! What in the WORLD are you doin’ wearing such smut!”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, it’s a.. It’s a friend of mine’s shirt, I didn’t know what it means, he let me borrow it while my clothes are in the wash.” Ryo tried his best to widen his hand out to cover the cartoon a little bit more without leaving space in his fingers where she could see the canine penetration underneath.
</p>
<p>
	His mom looked him up and down, and tilted her glasses down, “Scottish fella?”
</p>
<p>
	“Y…yeah.” Ryo looked down dejectedly at the kilt embroidered with two giant heads of people he’d never even heard of he was wearing and sighed. “Let me go upstairs and change… I’ll be right back.”
</p>
<p>
	“Okay, but hurry it up, Mr. Man. You and me are gonna watch Three Men & a Baby! You know it’s my favorite video.” His mom clapped her hands and then toddled off into the living room down the hall, still carrying the two cans of coke in her hands.
</p>
<p>
	“You got it, mom!” Ryo laughed awkwardly and shot up the stairs like a bolt, into his childhood room, slamming the door behind himself. “Jesus fuck…” he grumbled under his breath, back pressed to the door.
</p>
<p>
	“I HEARD THAT! NO CURSIN, MISTER!” came the familiar yell from downstairs. Ryo slumped his shoulders, sighing.
</p>
<p>
	—---------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	“You said you knew where this fucker lived.” Kayla S. Hunter groaned, shoving her hands into her leather jacket pockets dejectedly.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m well aware where he lives, Ms. Hunter. Please be patient. I spoke to his mother earlier today and she instructed me to return later to talk… after her soaps were over.” Came the slightly annoyed reply from Indrid Cold, who was seated behind the wheel of a gigantic 1958 Cadillac El Dorado, pure black and chrome, his gloved hands laying so lightly on the wheel that you would think power steering had been invented when this shit was made. But it t’weren’t.
</p>
<p>
	“I wanna go to McDonalds.” Pavlov Flinch whined, “They’ve got the Mario movie toys now, I wanna get a Toad.”
</p>
<p>
	“TOAD?! GOD you’re lame, Flinch.” Myrtle rolled her eyes, propping her head up against the car door with her arm in sheer boredom. “I’m gonna die again in this old man’s pussy-repellant car surrounded by NERDS.”
</p>
<p>
	“What?” Indrid said, raising an eyebrow over his red sunglasses.
</p>
<p>
	“Indrid, tell her that Toad isn’t lame. He’s the heart of the movie if you bothered to watch it.” Flinch countered, narrowing his eyes at Myrtle.
</p>
<p>
	“Myrtle, stop making eye contact with Flinch, you’re gonna catch whatever made him this way.” Kayla said, half paying attention as she stared out her window, propping her own chin up with the butt of her hand.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s called charm and charisma.” Flinch quipped back.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s called Athlete’s Foot by the smell of it.” Myrtle flipped Flinch the double bird and stuck her tongue out at him for the triple disrespect combo.
</p>
<p>
	“Look, are we going to McDonalds or not?” Flinch said, seemingly at the end of a rope no one even knew he was on, mentally.
</p>
<p>
	“No.” Indrid said plainly, turning into an alleyway and slowing the car to a stop.
</p>
<p>
	“What am I even doing here, then? I could be watching Red Shoe Diaries through the open window on my neighbor’s stolen cable like a civilized man. There’s even a bush to hide my business right there.” Flinch said indignantly.
</p>
<p>
	“You know, that’s a damn good question.” Kayla turned in her seat to face the rest as the car came to a stop in front of a fence at the end of the alley.
</p>
<p>
	“All that stuff about diddling himself outside the window?” Myrtle asked with disgust in her voice.
</p>
<p>
	“NO you braindead… I mean why is Flinch even here?” Kayla snapped back.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m leading this expedition.” Flinch responded, unwrapping a half-eaten Snickers from inside of his coat. “Oh god it melted inside my pocket…”
</p>
<p>
	The voices of all three occupants of his car raised and ran over each other into a cacophony of yelling as Indrid Cold sat back in his seat and gripped harder onto the steering wheel, letting out a deep, guttural, painful sigh from the bottom of his very being. Only a couple hours before he could meet with Ryo, he kept reminding himself. Only…a couple hours…
</p>
<p>
	—------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	“Oh that Tom Selleck, what a great actor! And so handsome too! He reminds me of your father.” Ryo’s mom said with a little chuckle, eating a couple pieces of popcorn as she watched the hilarious antics of Selleck, Danson, and Guttenberg up there on the screen.
</p>
<p>
	“Dad definitely had the same mustache…” Ryo said with a smirk, now having dressed himself like a normal human being - a baseball tee with the sleeves pushed up, a pair of jeans, and some socks since he was indoors and wearing shoes indoors is for freaks. Get comfy, you dumb shit, what are you doing?
</p>
<p>
	But the two barely had a moment to enjoy the not-at-all dated comedy movie that will surely not make you cringe your ass off your body if you watched today they had sat down to when the doorbell rang.
</p>
<p>
	Ryo was instantly on guard, and he couldn’t have told you why. There was a feeling within him that he just didn’t understand - one that he’d never felt before in his entire life. It was like the sudden realization that you’re not alone in a dark room at night - and it burned through him like fire.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, whoopsie-doodle, who could that be?” Ryo’s mom said with a start, setting aside her bowl of popcorn and standing up to walk to the door.
</p>
<p>
	“Wait, mom!” Ryo yelled out, a little too loud and forcefully. His mom turned with wide eyes and confusion on her face, causing him to settle back a bit, reeling it in. “Oh uh… I’ll get it, you sit down and enjoy Steve Guttenberg’s timeless comedy. I bet he won’t get homophobic even once!”
</p>
<p>
	His mom smiled with adoration for her now-grown son, and returned to the couch, nodding him ahead. Ryo stood up and sidled over to the door, grasping the handle carefully - his other hand balling into a fist. And once he yanked it open, fast and clean…
</p>
<p>
	There stood Kevin Green, his dweeby ass next door neighbor he went to high school with - dressed in a polo shirt with the collar turned up twenty years too late to be anything but cringey, a pair of khaki shorts, and sandals with socks - the ultimate outfit of a chode. If you’re listening to this wearing that exact outfit right now, congratulations fucker - you pull it off and don’t look like a chode at all. Thanks for listening to my podcast I do with my friends Josh and Rich.
</p>
<p>
	“Hey, Ryo! Long time no see, buddy! I didn’t expect you to be back from the ol’ Collegerino today!” Kevin said with a wide, far-too-toothy smile, his false enthusiasm flowing out of him like poison in a video game swamp level.
</p>
<p>
	“.....hey Kevin.” Ryo said, trying to hide the disdain in his voice, then thinking better of it and decided who the fuck cares and leaning a little out the door to him. “What the fuck are you doin’ here, dude? It’s 10:30 on a Saturday morning.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh wow, potty mouth alert! Ha ha, but seriously I’m here for a good ol’ cuperr-ino of sugar! Me and Dad are baking a cake to celebrate the birth of our lord and savior, Jesus Christ!” Kevin said, smiling even wider somehow, approaching the uncanny valley like a rocket.
</p>
<p>
	“....it’s May. You literally can’t get any further from Christmas than this.” Ryo said disgustedly, looking Kevin up and down like he was made of flopping dicks from top to bottom - which wasn’t too far from the truth.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s never too early to celebrate Jesus!” Kevin beamed.
</p>
<p>
	“Look if you don’t fuck off in about ten seconds I’m gonna send you straight to Jesus you unwashed foreskin in a human suit, and don’t think I–”
</p>
<p>
	“RYO? WHO IS IT HONEY BUNCHES?!” Ryo’s mom yelled through the house.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s Kevin from next door, Mrs. Tachibana! I’ve come for a cup of sugar!” Kevin yelled back in return, smiling brightly at Ryo afterward. “You’re a funny bunny, Ryo. That’s why we were always such good pals.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’ve always hated you.” Ryo said.
</p>
<p>
	“OH COME ON IN! I’VE GOT THE SUGAR READY!” Mrs. Tachibana yelled from the kitchen now.
</p>
<p>
	“On my way, Mrs. Tachibana, thank you so much!” Kevin stepped around Ryo and smiled right in his face again in that over-familiar way that Christians do that they think is open and inviting but really activates that ape brain center that remembers showing teeth as a sign of aggression. Then he headed to the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
	“Fuckin’ hell…” Ryo muttered under his breath, slamming the door shut and following.
</p>
<p>
	“You’ll have to stay and watch Three Men & a Baby with us, Kevin! It’s a classic film!” Mrs. Tachibana chuckled, handing the evangelistic intruder a small cup filled with sugar. “Oh I hope that’ll be enough, I haven’t been to the store today.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh thank you so much, Mrs. Tachibana. Are you actually headed to the store today? I’d absolutely love to tack a few things onto your grocery list if you wouldn’t mind picking them up for me. I’d pay for them and your groceries, of course.” Kevin smiled brightly.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh well as a matter of fact, yes. I was going to go once he finished the movie but…” Ryo’s mom looked at the clock and tutted, placing a finger to her chin. “I suppose it is starting to get a little late, and we do need to start the film over for Kevin…. I’ll just pop out real quick and pick everything up.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh that would be lovely.” Kevin said, digging a small paper list out of his pocket and handing it to her, along with his debit card.
</p>
<p>
	“What’s going on here, now?” Ryo said, stunned at whatever the fuck just happened that made it where he was going to have to entertain dorky ass Kevin Green alone.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh now don’t pout, Ryo! I’ll be back lickety split, sweetie!” His mom leaned up and gave him a big kiss on the cheek and gripped his arm, shaking it lovingly like sweet ol moms do. She picked up her purse and was out the door like lightning after that, leaving Ryo and Kevin standing awkwardly in the kitchen, Ryo trying not to make eye contact.
</p>
<p>
	“So how has the life the good lord bestowed upon you been treating you, Ryo?” Kevin said with his trademark empty smile, sliding a chair out at the kitchen table and taking a seat.
</p>
<p>
	Ryo didn’t move from the doorway, sliding his hands into his pockets. “I’d really rather not get into it, Kevin. If it’s all the same.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh no, no it’s not, my wayward sheep. Please.” Kevin pushed the chair out opposite of him from the table with his foot and motioned towards it. “Sit.”
</p>
<p>
	Ryo reluctantly sat down across from him. Kevin placed his elbow on the table and held his hand out toward him. “How about an arm wrestle until your mom gets back?” Kevin tilted his head down, smiling widely and looking up from under his eyebrows at Ryo. Something about it was more unsettling than if someone was doing it with malice, but that’s hyper-Christians.
</p>
<p>
	“Y’know what, yeah. I’d love to injure you under false pretenses.” Ryo grinned, before realizing he said that out loud and correcting himself, “I mean arm wrestle. For fun.”
</p>
<p>
	The two sat across from one another and entwined hands. Before a countdown could even be started, Kevin put a tremendous amount of force behind his hand and almost slammed Ryo’s down onto the table. Thankfully Ryo caught himself and began to push back against it. The two struggled at the equilibrium in the middle, back and forth.
</p>
<p>
	“You seem like you’ve had a rough go of it recently, Ryo.” Kevin said, that same smile plastered across his midwestern features.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s been hard, yeah. But I’ll turn it around. Figure things out.” Ryo said, straining slightly. The slow realization began to down on him in that moment but he didn’t really have time to formulate it.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh Ryo… no you won’t.” Kevin returned, his voice dropping an octave and the smile dropping off his face completely.
</p>
<p>
	“What?” Ryo said, stunned, the thought finally forming in his mind – how could this guy possibly be strong enough to hold his hand in place like this? He had been surgically altered into a killing machine and this dude was mostly home-schooled until 9th grade and took his cousin to the Prom.
</p>
<p>
	“You’ll never escape… you should have let us ascend you to godhood to begin with. It is wonder beyond measure…” Kevins fingers dug into the flesh of Ryo’s hand, holding it shaking in place, the blood beginning to pour from the wounds that Kevin’s fingernails were digging in, staining the white linen tablecloth below.
</p>
<p>
	“Ghn… you’re…” Ryo began, but Kevin cut him off
</p>
<p>
	“Gestalt.”
</p>
<p>
	Ryo quickly thrust his other arm forward, his fist landing squarely into Kevin’s eye socket and causing his head to rock backwards from the force - but it immediately snapped forward again, his eyeball dropping out of his socket onto the table like nothing had held it in this entire time, and rolling slowly onto the food with a disgusting squish.
</p>
<p>
	“One way or another you’re returning with me, Ryo… you have been chosen, just as I… we will all be one…” Kevins flesh began to melt away from his body, swirling and sinking like polymer under heat, sloughing off of him onto the floor and skidding across the linoleum kitchen floor. Bones snapped and ripping apart shuffled beneath the slowly receding surface and pressed inward, creating a new exoskeleton beyond the meat and organs below - criss-crossing over themselves in a loud, horrendous explosion of grinding viscera.
</p>
<p>
	Ryo tried as hard as he could to wrench his hand away but couldn’t even budge the arm that was mangling itself and resettling with glistening, slithering armor, the once off-putting smiling face of Kevin Green being replaced with a carapace lined with bleeding holes and multiple sets of black, lifeless eyes staring into his very soul from beneath.
</p>
<p>
	“Give into it, Ryo… change… or die…” the gurgling, hateful voice from somewhere deep inside the carapace groaned out, Ryo’s whole body quaking in fear and yanking as hard as it could away from danger in pure fight or flight mode. Over the sickening man beasts shoulder slowly rose a glistening wet mass, long and thin, prehensile, and moving all it’s own - tipped with a gigantic scythe-like blade that was dripping bright green fluid onto the table - each drop smoking and sizzling as it ate through the fabric and wood it touched.
</p>
<p>
	“No… noo!!” Ryo screamed, sliding his entire body down as far as he could go to the floor under his chair, the scythe-like blade flitting through the air and piercing nothing where Ryo’s head used to be. The beast man let out a horrific squealing roar, the blade streaking through the air and slicing the back of the chair off completely, leaving only burning green mucus in it’s wake where the wood once existed.
</p>
<p>
	The thing that was once Kevin changed its grip on Ryo’s arm and raised his body up into the air in front of it, the hulking scorpion-esque form standing up to it’s full heigh to allow Ryo’s body to dangle from his grip. “You’re going to die if you don’t let it take you… give in, Ryo… give in and become what you TRULY are now! You’ll never be human again!”
</p>
<p>
	Ryo screamed at the top of his lungs and swung his legs into the midsection of the horror, but his socked feet just pattered harmlessly against its armored chitinous form. The creature drew him in close, their eyes meeting and their faces almost touching. The gurgling voice seemed to laugh, as well it could, then whispered in a rueful hiss, “Perhaps when I rip your mother to pieces, you’ll finally gain the motivation…”
</p>
<p>
	The scream which left Ryo’s lungs was terrifyingly familiar. An inhuman screech which he had only bore witness to once in his life and had hoped to never experience again. It was like letting yourself finally do something you’d always wanted to do, but had known the entire while the consequences would be far too dire. And the consequences this time would be more dire than even Ryo could truly fathom.
</p>
<p>
	Flesh, bone, organs, meat, ripped, tore, sluiced and scattered - rearranging one over the other and under the other, knitted into a new form - made from the same components that once created the human being known as Ryo Tachibana - but twisted and violently turned into nothing that was human could remain. Instead, an abominable creature, chittering and screeching to the sky the bloodlust which drove it’s every horrendous thought. Insectoid and hateful, the being that Ryo had felt at the edge of his mind this whole day took hold - and lashed out.
</p>
<p>
	A hand full of recurved bladed fingertips swiped across the chitnous face of the scorpion horror, sending it reeling back away and causing it to release its grip on what was once Ryo’s arm. The cricket man leapt across the room, landing in the doorway and throwing it’s arm to the side. Splitting the arm open from the inside, a long recurved blade emerged from his flesh, dripping with an inhuman purple viscous blood, and shifted itself around to face blade-foward - the monstrous Ryo throwing its head back and letting out a deafening howling screech - it’s solid face opening up to reveal the insectoid mandibled maw beneath just long enough for the scream to echo through the house before closing.
</p>
<p>
	The Scorpion threw itself at him, it’s elongated prehensile tail swinging through the air like a guillotine seeking its throat to sever, but the cricket leapt straight over it, it’s incredible agility moving it faster than the eye could follow. The Scorpion slammed into the wall and barreled through it, it’s massive body obliterating the materials and sending them splintering in every direction.
</p>
<p>
	The Cricket bounded off the ceiling of the room, leaving behind crushed wood and splintered plaster in his wake, and landed on the floor across the room. He grabbed either side of the massive oak kitchen table and lifted it above its head like a paperweight, heaving it through the hole in the wall the Scorpion resided in like a javelin - but the Scorpion simply splintered it into a million pieces with a single swipe of its jagged clawed hand.
</p>
<p>
	“You’re still fighting it, Ryo…! You have to give yourself to Gestalt! You must remember you are chosen..! Ascended!” The Scorpion’s deep, growling voice echoed from within it’s covered chitnous mouth, the humongous beasts body hurling itself forward once again.
</p>
<p>
	But now the size difference, and more importantly, the speed difference became the deciding factor. The Scorpion was huge, and strong, but the Cricket was incredibly fast. Bounding off of his right foot, The Cricket dove directly toward the Scorpion, taking him completely off guard. The long, serrated, curved blade jutting from deep within the muscle and tissue of The Cricket’s arm jutted straight forward, slicing into and sticking between the flesh and bone of the middle of his hand, creating a perfect spear-point
</p>
<p>
	Which pierced straight through the middle of The Scorpion’s face, and down and out of the bottom of it’s skull, rending both halves away from one another and sending brain matter, bone, and blood spraying like a lawn sprinkler in every direction as the two bodies collided in the middle finally.
</p>
<p>
	The cricket stood up, it’s blade sliding out of the muscle of the now twitching, lifeless corpse of The Scorpion. He threw his head back, the mandibles of his face flying wide open again as the horrendous, cacophonous sound echoed through his childhood home, which was now covered in blood and viscera from one end of the first floor to the other.
</p>
<p>
	Ch-chkk. Click. Errrrrrrr. The front door opened. The creature that was once Ryo Tachibana shot to attention, its many-segmented eyes glowing a faint, rueful, violent red.
</p>
<p>
	—-----------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	Indrid Cold stood outside of the Tachibana home, his neatly gloved hands clasped together behind his back and his unknowable eyes peering from behind round, red, sunglasses at the slightly ajar front door about twenty feet in front of him. He eyed the silver key which dangled out of the lock warily. He wore his standard, all-black fashion attire, and seemed somewhat hesitant to enter.
</p>
<p>
	“Mr. Tachibana?” Cold called toward the door, cupping his hand to the side of his mouth to carry his voice.
</p>
<p>
	The stumbling, blood-covered, beaten and abused body of the very human looking Ryo Tachibana clattered to the front door, opening it further and leaning against the inside of the doorframe. He squinted his eyes as if he’d just awakened from a long dream.
</p>
<p>
	“Wh…who… are…” he managed to mumble out, shading his eyes to the afternoon sun to peer out.
</p>
<p>
	“My name is Indrid Cold. I represent a group of… shall we say good samaritans. We want to help you with your… problem.” Cold called after, returning his hands behind his back.

	“Why did he go without us, do you think?” Myrtle murmured, laying on her back with her legs crossed in the air on the one motel bed that Indrid had purchased for the three of them.

	“Intimidated by my raw animal magnetism, I would say.” Flinch returned, shoving half of a Quarter Pounder with cheese into his mouth as he made his small plastic Toad figure dance on the motel desk back and forth, pretending it was kissing a pen he was pretending was a sexy lady toad.

	“Then how come he didn’t take you with him, then, Professor Hunter?” Myrtle said with a tiny grin on her face.
</p>
<p>
	“What?” Kayla started, looking up from her phone for the first time in ages, “You really wanna start some shit with the person who pays your paycheck AND staples your head back on into place every god damn morning, you little shit?”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh uhm… no ma’am.” Myrtle said, rolling over in the bed and pulling out her own phone. The extremely loud sounds of Pewdiepie began blasting out of it at full volume.
</p>
<p>
	“Ooo lady Mushroom, what a coincidence meeting you here and with no pants…” Flinch muttered under his breath, clearly turning the pen over into a doggystyle position and placing the Toad behind it. “Let’s get to sporing…”
</p>
<p>
	“I was a professor once…” Kayla said to no one in particular.

	THE END
