One Man Mission

By Jeff Pennington

Prompts: Promises & Fractures


The low and steady hum of the spacecraft had been the only sound he had heard for hours now. He tried to occupy himself as best he could but the hours were far too many. From time to time he would find himself staring at nothing - a bolt in the metallic bulkhead at the edge of the control modules, a line in the ceramic floor beneath his feet, a blinking light on a panel that was meant to tell him that oxygen was venting from one or more of the oxygen recycling units.


“Oh, wait, shit!” John suddenly jolted forward, recognizing the flashing lights' urgency all at once. He quickly began typing a command into the panel beneath the blinking light - to shut off all open valves exiting oxygen recycling unit 7.


After a moment, the light stopped, the frantic blood pumping into his ears settling back into the comfortable hum of the ship once more. Back to why he’d taken the job in the first place - the banality. Well that and the promise of decent healthcare.


John Halloway had been piloting this shipping freighter from Earth to Ganymede for the past month and a half and still had about the same amount of time to go before arrival. “Piloting” might honestly be a strong word - he mostly just sat and daydreamed about alien women both being real and also fucking him real, real good. 


He would get to a part in the fantasy where naturally one of the sexy alien broads would want to probe him, as aliens are want to do, and he would shake that off as not being sexy cause he’s a totally straight-as-an-arrow type manly man. But the longer the trip went on the more available his orifices would become, every time.


“Captain Halloway.” a voice broke John from his reverie just before insertion, his eyes opening and his lips pursing in frustration. It was the voice of the onboard company computer - System. It was the somewhat nasal male voice of some celebrity he couldn’t place that everyone back home loved but everyone on other planetary colonies hadn’t heard of - mostly because of all the forced labor and starving they were dealing with. John thought that he was the guy from the 3rd Green Acres reboot who played the old guy but he could have been the dude from the Black Mirror revival who fucked the pig full frontal. TV censorship laws had changed a lot.


“What is it now, System?” John huffed out, sitting up straight again.


“GriftCo Company policy states that all materials aboard a class F shipping freighter must be logged and accounted for at least four times during the journey from launch to destination.” System squawked out. “You have done this vital task a grand total of ….0…. Times. This is an egregious break in protocol.”


“Why don’t you do the vital task of sucking my class F shitting freighter, System?” John said with a smirk, leaning back in his chair with his hands behind his head and his boots propped up on the control panel like a fuckin rad ass bad boy. 


There was a moment of silence.


“That means my butt.” John clarified with a wider, somehow smarmier smirk.


“I comprehend.” System said. “Are you going to complete the task now?”


“Fine, fine.” John dropped his boots to the floor and stood up, shifting his overalls around to not be all wadded up around his dick like they always got. “Nag nag nag nag nag…” He walked to the back of the piloting module and manually slid the broken old door open that was supposed to swoosh open like on Star Trek but capitalism still existed so it would cost money to fix so fuck it.


Down the central shaft (lol) of the ship was a single man-sized hallway which connected each of the different shipping containers that the freighter was carrying to the engines at the back and the pilot module on the front. John made his way to the first container and pressed his palm into the scanner on the wall next to its door. A small confirmation beep followed and a keypad dropped from the wall next to the scanner.


“Alright, what have we got behind door number one…” John typed in a few passcodes and then was allowed to view the manifest. He began to read off the itemized list of cargo he was hauling out loud to himself as his eyes scanned the screen. 


“Abrimoxin 7… fourty crates. What the hell is Abrimoxin 7?” He pulled his brand new state of the art Apple phone out of his pocket with space age technologies we could only dream of in this day and age - The iPhone 15, and paid his 7 Bing Coin to utlize the all-mighty Codex of All Human Knowledge brought to you by Microsoft Bing. “Holy shit, it’s a SUPER powerful fertility drug! What the hell else is in here?”


“KY Jelly… 100 crates?! Dozens of crates of dildos, buttplugs, vibrators, french ticklers, every kind of sex toy you could imagine, Barry White on CD and cassette, and….four million subscription codes to Blacked dot com?! Somebody out in space is gettin fucked tonight!”


He suddenly felt an intense jealousy well up within him. He hadn’t gotten laid in ages because of this stupid ass job and there weren’t gonna be any assplay aliens being discovered anytime soon to fuck him on the job so he was left high and LITERALLY dry! It just wasn’t fucking fair!


He stopped himself immediately however, his eyes widening and looking back and forth to make sure no camera had monitored the looks on his face. After the Great Incel Purge of Stardate 20-4-7-3-69 he dare not fall into the trap of incelism like his forebears had - he dare not post Pepe the Frog and seeth as they had. 

He just marked off Container 1 as inspected and moved onto the next one. The manifest was much more boring and mundane this time, just a bunch of useless ass silver being sent to some dump site to be processed into an actually useful metal. Silver had become worthless sometime in the early 21st century when inflation had made a gold brick worth like two or three bucks. Some time after the Musk Wars but before Donald Trump saw any actual consequences. I really hope this is secretly an alternate universe story after writing that but aaaaanyway


He typed his digital signature into the screen and looked down the long corridor ahead of him with a heaving sigh. There were 46 more cargo bays to go through before he could go back to the cockpit and zone the fuck out thinking about green fannies again and the task seemed straight up insurmountable.


BANG …bang…(bang)...


The sound split the low humming drone of the ship and echoed off the walls of the central hall into barely audible infinity. John stood straight, fear paralyzing him in place. John was the only crew member of this shipping freighter - no one had been on this ship besides him in the month and a half it had been in transit to Ganymede.


He stood silently in place, his fingers gripping onto either side of the control panel in front of him with white knuckle fear. He didn’t even breathe waiting for the next sound to come… but it didn’t. The silence enveloped everything, quieter than he had ever remembered it being before.


“System…” John whispered hoarsly, trying to keep his voice down as low as he could manage.


“System online. Yes, Captain Halloway?” the robotic voice clicked back to life from the speaker on the wall above him with an electronic hiss and a pop which caused John to jump a little from the puncturing of quiet.


“What was that noise? Just now?”


“Auditory sensors indicated no anomalous noises. You have made every living noise in the last…” System paused to calculate the data. “45 days.”


“No, no…!” John spoke a little louder now, his frustration overwhelming his sudden fear of the unknown. “Like thirty seconds ago! There was a loud bang from down the hallway!”


“There was no anomalous sound recorded.” System responded flatly.


“Fat lot of good you ever do me. Something made a noise down the hall from here somewhere, I’m not making shit up!” John yelled now, waving a middle finger up at the speaker on the wall.


“You are the only living being aboard this vessel, Captain Halloway. Need I remind you this is a one man mission? No other personnel have ever been required for this level of operation.” 

BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!


The sound in the far distance began to repeat itself, the sound of metal slamming against metal, rhythmic but not mechanical - far, far too violent and heavy.


John grabbed his ears to block out the sound, which echoed off the metallic corridor and threatened to burst his ear drums. He ran, stumbling with his eyes squinted and his body doubled over, back the way he had come into the hallway - and back into the piloting module of the freighter. He grabbed the sliding door and slammed it shut, hard, causing it to rattle a little but sealing him inside all the same. 


Even inside the module the banging was loud and clear, filling up his ears to near bursting, and vibrating his skull against his brain.


He dropped to the floor on the other side of the door and held his hands tighter over his ears, screaming out for the sound to stop… and it did. Almost instantly.


He sat quietly in a heap on the floor, his hands still on his ears, before he opened his eyes slowly and looked around. He was greeted by the pilot module the same as it had always been. Lights slowly burning behind buttons and switches, small monitors giving readouts he could barely remember how to read from orientation, his random collection of mostly stolen magazines and books from dentist and doctor’s office visits throughout his life. All of it was exactly the same.


“Are you functioning at parameters, Captain Halloway?” System’s waffling electronic voice pierced the silence once more, rattling the small cage around the speakerbox hanging over the blast shield at the front of the module.


“You… you can’t tell me you didn’t hear that shit!” John screamed at the speakerbox, shakily standing back up off the floor and leaning against the sealed metal door behind him. “That shit was at LEAST as loud as a lawn mower on recording day!”


“I do not know what you are referencing. Please provide specific parameters.” System responded plainly.


“Oh for fucks… shut yourself down! Right the fuck now! I’m done being gaslit by Hal None-Thousand!” John screamed out, too freaked out and angry to understand how shitty his insult was.


“I cannot go offline during operation of the freighter.” System again responded without inflection, being incapable of it, even if someone actually did insult it right.


“Go into self-diagnostic mode, then. Full scan.” John heaved out a heavy sigh, walking back over to his pilot’s chair at the center of the room.


“Yes, Captain. Beginning full self-diagnostic scan. This will take approximately one hour.” System whirred offline, the small diode that lit up underneath the speakers when they were in use dimming to blackness simultaneously. 


“Maybe you can figure out why you’re such a see you next cuntsday while you’re at it.” John snorted under his breath.


He immediately pulled up the security footage from inside of each container on the large viewscreen in front of him and began to look over them with wide, bloodshot eyes. Each one was dark inside save for the running lights that were always on for like.. Atmospheric reasons, he supposed. Like to make it look more badass and sci-fi-y or whatever. But across every screen he couldn’t spot a single thing out of place - even in that fuck-container with all the dildos and porn. Everything seemed safe - except the sex they were gonna have. 


“Man… I’m cracking up…” John whispered to himself, sitting back in his seat and shaking his head. “Could I have just like… been hearing things? Maybe I just haven’t been getting enough sleep? I always have a lot of trouble sleeping on ships…”


He thought to himself for a moment and then stood up resolutely. Taking a short walk over to the back left wall of the pilot’s module he pressed a couple buttons on the wall, causing a long cot to hinge down from the wall through the space age magic called ‘murphy bed.’ He reached into the storage space where the bed had been and grabbed his blanket and pillow, haphazardly dropping it onto the cot before flopping himself down on it.


“System has auditory recording systems all over the ship to make sure I don’t steal anything or take an unregulated piss break thanks to the Amazon Warehouse Monitoring technology aboard. They’re so sensitive they can pick up a pin drop there’s no way that kinda sound could get past ‘em. I’m just being crazy cause I haven’t slept.” John chuckled to himself and turned over on the cot.


“No clue how I could ever fall asleep in such a potentially dangerous and terrifying situation in the middle of deep space but–” SNOOOORRREEEEE. John was out like a fucking light, his mouth wide open and gurgling horrifically loud snores out into the open air in a way that explained at least a little of why no one was sleeping with him. 


His dreams were fitful. He couldn’t explain why but for some reason he kept dreaming the same dream no matter how many times he started awake and shook it from his mind before falling back asleep. There was a strange, red mass in the middle of space, swirling in and on itself, like some kind of undulating mass of translucent flesh. And his freighter ship slid into it no matter how hard he pulled the controls the other way. He saw it envelope the ship, and draw him backward, out of himself. And in front of him, in the far distance, he could see himself screaming as it took him again, ripping him apart into nothingness before his own eyes. 


CLANK CLANK CLANK CLANK


John shot up in his bed, his eyes red and bloodshot, his hands gripping his blanket as tightly as he could. The door to the piloting module was against the same wall as him and he could see it shaking hard against its hinges, back and forth, clanging and clanking against the metal on either side of its runners as something bashed against it on the other side. 


He leapt from the cot and raced across the room, sliding to a stop in front of the door and yanking the porthole cover open to look out into the hallway and see the face of his tormentor, his own voice peeling out a scream the instance he yanked the covering away.


But the clanking stopped the instant he could see into the hallway - to see nothing on the other side of the glass besides an empty corridor extending far beyond what he could make out through the old smeared glass.


John stared, wide-eyed and shaking, into the hallway beyond, at the emptiness where his terror had originated. There weren’t any answers through that porthole, but he searched for them desperately anyway.


“N-no… I…” John looked back into the piloting module, terror gripping him as he searched the room. The fear that whatever it was out there had already gotten in here threatened to tear him apart at the seams as he desperately searched every corner of the room. 


“System…!” he screamed out to activate the ship’s computer, but no response came. He stared unblinkingly at the dim light below the speaker that System communicated through, waiting with burning anxiety in his veins for it to light up, but it would not, even under his scrutiny.


“SYSTEM!!” he screamed out again. But no response came. He ran over to the pilots chair and flopped down hard, turning on the cameras in the hallway and inside of the shipping containers once more. 


The rooms were perfectly still, just as before. The hallway was completely empty. The creates full of KY Jelly were still read for lubricating whatever hole you wanted to dick down at a moment’s notice. Everything was the same.


“I’m losing it… that had to be a sound in my dream! Oh god… I’ve straight up gone Ren & Stimpy… I’ve got fucking space madness!” John rubbed the sides of his face, shaking his head as he referenced a like fourth or fifth attempt to reboot that show and not the original so stay the fuck off my back with timeline shit it all makes sense. I’ll kill you.


“Look, I just need to relax a little. Yeah! I just gotta unwind.” John swiveled his chair to a smaller monitor to his right and flicked a switch under it. The screen hummed to life and he flicked a couple more buttons until his favorite late night broadcast greeted him - Glorbo Malkin’s Talkin’ & Walkin’ With Malkin live from Seti Alpha 3! 


On tonight’s episode of Glorbo Malkin’s Talkin’ and Walkin’ with Malkin’, the host Malkin’ was Talkin’ and Walkin’ with Macauley Culkin’ while his sidekick Bulkin the Vulcan was skulkin’ and sulkin’ that he didn’t get to join in. A classic rerun we’ve all seen a million times. This was just the regular Macauley Culkin by the way, he discovers a pizza that makes you immortal in 2025. Did you know he’s baby daddy to River Song, the girl who played the stuck up rich girl on The Suite Life of Zack and Cody? Fuckin’ wild. 


Yes Josh, one of those kids is on Riverdale, we know.  


John was starting to feel a little bit better, laughing at all of Macauley Culkins funny anecdotes and stories of being alive for a hundred years or whenever this story takes place, I don’t know. Maybe he had just gotten caught up in some of the sounds of the ship that he hadn’t heard before and thought it was something else. Standard spooky time home alone everyone has had from time to time. He’d just spooked himself about…. Wait… new sounds on the ship?


“Oh fuck me!” John screamed, twisting his chair around to the left side of his console and frantically bringing up the damage reports for the last hour or so since the first sound had happened. 


Surely enough, the oxygen recycling unit, even sealed off, had ruptured and had created an oxygen fire near the engines of the ship. The fire had been spreading through the components outside of the ship and was now reaching to the inner components. If they reach the engine then the entire freighter would go up in smoke almost instantly.


“OH FUCK ME!” John screamed even louder, turning his chair back around to stand up. 


But as he turned past the central monitor, which still displayed the security footage from the entire ship, he caught sight of something that stopped him dead in his tracks. In the camera just outside of the pilot module, just outside of the room he sat in at that very moment, there stood a man. He wore a space walk suit, its black visor dented inward and fire burning at his sleeve and crawling up it. The man stood completely motionless, the suit burning around him and slowly dripping and dangling off his arm and midsection as he stood staring into the camera. Beneath the dark glass two pallid, empty eyes were staring, almost unseen, straight at John. Not at the camera. At John.


John sat transfixed, horrified, his entire body still besides the convulsive shaking of fear. The audio receptors in the hallway slowly whirred to life as they picked up sound on the other side of the door. John looked down at them with wide eyes and shaking pupils. As they finally clicked on, the sound of manic laughter filled the room around him. Cackling, insane, inhuman laughter that squelched and squealed with electronic signal.


John turned his eyes back to the middle monitor and the man in the space walk suit, burning alive inside of it, now mostly cinders and melting flesh, just in time for a wall of flame to rush down the hallway behind him and overtake his body, rending him apart instantaneously in a crucible of blue and white flame.


John screamed at the top of his lungs, his eyes never blinking as they stared at the horror unfolding on his monitor. The moment the fire had consumed the man, the monitor went pitch black. But only for a moment. It clicked back on to reveal an empty, untouched, unharmed hallway, with no sign of anyone of anything, exactly as he had left it when he came inside.


John sat silently, convulsing in fear he was shaking so hard, sweat dripping down his brow and his mouth agape. 


VREEEEEE….VVRREEEEEE….VVREEEEE


Red alert began to sound suddenly, shocking John from his reverie. Every screen on the ship began to display the oxygen fire outside and the warning that it was about to ignite the fuel near the engines at any moment. John sat motionless as the lights flashed red around him over and over, his mind racing to comprehend what had just happened and what was now going on.


“System online. Captain Halloway! Red Alert!” System’s voice whirred back to life after its self-diagnostic just in time to call out the red alert scenario. “ We are in a Defcon 4 scenario! You must vent the fuel near engine one or the entire freighter will explode! This will cost the company a non-zero amount of money to replace the ship and cargo! Loss of company property and funds is unacceptable!”


John was shook out of his reverie by the crushing weight of space capitalism and began to run on autopilot to get out of one horrific scenario even if he didn’t comprehend another. He ran to the door, yanking it open again thanks to its busted whooshing mechanism, and then slamming it back shut again. 


There was longer than a football field’s difference between the piloting module and the engine rooms and John wasn’t in the best shape of his life at this point. He had at one time been a shoe-in for becoming the next Lord of the Dance but the judgement committee found out he wasn’t actually Irish and they banned him from ever returning to Ireland or dancing without using his arms. Since taking this job he’d really become sedentary though. 


Still, he took the run as well as he could, pushing past every one of the shipping container units down that long straight corridor for what felt like an eternity before he finally reached Engine Bay 1. He typed in his password, clicked the box saying he wasn’t a robot, had to solve three capchas anyway, and then he was in.


“Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck!” he screamed as he ran up the stairs in the engine room two by two to make it to the exhaust valves at the back half of the room. He grabbed onto the first valve and immediately felt the seering heat of it in his palms and yanked his hands away at once. 


“OH FUCK the oxygen fire is already in the release mechanism!!” he screamed expositionally. “I gotta jettison engine one! It’s gonna fucking blow up!”

John ran back down those steps like a freshman late for his first make-out session with Becky Miller by the bleachers after sixth period, boots clanging on the metal at the bottom in record speed. He ran to the exit door back into the central corridor and quickly typed his password back into the control panel, dancing from foot to foot and glancing over his shoulder as he did. 


“Incorrect password.” the machine responded.


“Oh god no, please!” John screamed out, typing his password on again. The same sound dinged out of it instantly. 


John looked around the floor of the room and smiled a gallows smile as he saw a crossbar leaning against the wall. He grabbed it up and brandished it as best as his scorched hands would allow him and he brought it down hard and fast into the control panel to the door. 


BANG …bang…(bang)...


The sound of the first strike echoed as he drew back the crossbar and began to bash it repeatedly into the control panel, splintering it into pieces on this side of the wall and sending the outside pieces flying from the force of each repeated blow for what felt like ages.


BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!


The machinery of the panel was knocked through the thin metal wall, dangling from wires and nodules from the other side. John quickly grasped onto the door and yanked it open as he had to constantly do to the pilot’s module door, throwing it aside and starting at a sprint back down the hallway.


“System! Jettison engine one immediately!” John screamed over the klaxons still blaring out the red alert as he ran.


“Unable to comply.” System responded. “Engine jettison requires manual override at pilot module with command eject codes.”


“YOU FUCKING SUCK!” John screamed at the top of his lungs, trying his hardest to sprint faster. 


When he finally did make it to the end of the hallway and the pilot module, he was frantic to get back inside and save himself. He had been horrified in so many ways, traumatized in so many ways, the company shrink was gonna make BANK eating all of his insurance payout and bing coin for the rest of his career if he made it out of this one. 


He latched his hands onto the broken door of the pilot module and wrenched it sideways to slide it open with all of his might - but the door did not budge. He felt a tug in his shoulder as he tried, the muscle splitting there causing him to scream out in pain and disbelief. 


“No… no no no nooooo!!” he began to scream over and over, gripping onto the handle even with his torn ligament and beginning to violently wrench it back and forth, shaking it as hard as he could. 


CLANK CLANK CLANK CLANK


The door slammed and banged against its runners but would not budge under his strength. He heaved it back and forth three dozen or more times before he stumbled backwards, almost slipping from the weight of his body dejectedly collapsing on itself.


Leaning against the wall near cargo bay two, he stared down the long corridor at the doors to the engine rooms in the far distance, which were beginning to glow brightly and distend from the growing heat in the metal from the oxygen fires. 


He frantically looked around for anything that could help him and settled his eyes on a large panel on the wall right next to the pilots module. Quickly he moved over to it and dropped down a small input screen from the wall and dexterously entered in his access codes. The panel on the wall slid open and revealed a fire proof space walk suit inside which he yanked down from the hooks it was held up on almost immediately and began shoving himself into it.


The suit was most assuredly meant for a man taller than him but he buckled it in tight enough to fit around him alright. He yanked the helmet visor down over his eyes and sealed it, the slight hiss of the oxygen tank on the back of it letting him know it was still in working condition thankfully. 


He turned and began to run, as best he could in this bulky space suit, toward the first airlock just down past cargo bay six. But the doors at the far, far end of the central hallway - to both engine bay one and two, in that moment, exploded off of their hinges, releasing a torrent of unbelievably bright, plasmatic flame in blue and white down the hallway, which engulfed everything in its path.


All John had time to do was turn his body to face the camera just above the door into the pilot module. The glass on the outside of the porthole shone in the reflective light of the flames which rushed toward him like death itself on wings. It shone just enough to reveal his reflection to him.


Severe heat had caught his sleeve on fire, and it crept up his arm and singed away at his flesh beneath it, though he felt no pain. He felt nothing in that moment as he stared into the reflection of the black abyss peering back at him from the space walk suit’s dark visor. The black glass began to crack and dent inward from the unearthly heat which permeated the hallway, fracturing into shards.


He felt himself laugh as he finally realized. His entire body convulsed from it. As the wall of blue and white flames engulfed him his cackling voice was manic, almost unrecognizable. Almost.


The End
