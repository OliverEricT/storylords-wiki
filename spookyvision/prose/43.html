	TK found herself without rhyme or reason standing in the center of a gigantic white room. Along its walls were seams which divided the flat surfaces into large reflective squares, far beyond her reach. The darkness between the cracks seemed to reach out into the perfect sterility of the white room in a way that pulled at her insecurities - drove the fear within her heart even harder at the sight. The quiet hum of halogen bulbs was all the sound in the white room she found herself in now. There were no explosions, no screaming, nothing. Not even the voices of her friends calling out to her. Just the static hum.
</p>
<p>
	“Hello…?” she quietly spoke finally, the sound of her own voice splintering the droning near-silence violently enough to cause her to recoil. There was no answer.
</p>
<p>
	He strained her eyes against the white and tried hard to focus past the blinding sameness of it all. Her body shuddered at the distant thought in the back of her mind that this was all there was ever going to be now. 
</p>
<p>
	But there was more suddenly. Far, far in the distance, there was a figure. She could barely make it out from the seering brightness surrounding her, but it was there all the same. 
</p>
<p>
	“Hello…!” she called a lot louder this time, her voice echoing off the sheer walls and ceiling into infinity down the endless expanse before her. The figure did not stir.
</p>
<p>
	TK began to walk very slowly - her every step timid and cautious - but slowly but surely she found herself moving quicker. Something about the space behind her sent her heart to racing every time she had faced a new direction. The fear in her blood jolted and spiked every with every step she took, suddenly feeling the oppressing force of something bearing down upon her from behind. Something chasing after her in the blinding light.
</p>
<p>
	She was suddenly very much like a child running up the stairs to escape the creature in the basement’s darkness, running full tilt across the empty expanse towards the figure in the distance. Every step that brought her closer burned her fear deeper into her bones.
</p>
<p>
	And then she was upon it. All at once, not like she had ran over, more like she had been transported. The figure sat facing away from her on a small metal chair, slumped forward with loose shoulders and a drooped head. It wore a scientists coat over a business suit as best she could tell as she slowly walked a circle around its seated body. In its right hand it dangled a bronze metal Staff of Caduceus, which at one end had scraped the floor with its tip at one point.
</p>
<p>
	She peered down at the jagged marking it had left on the white floor and puzzled for a moment over its familiarity. It almost looked like a cricket.
</p>
<p>
	“H…hello I said! Are you..” she reached out a hand and placed it to the shoulder of the slumped over man, but what she felt at her fingertips was wrong, instantly.
</p>
<p>
	She gasped out loud, every bit of air escaping her lungs as her hand pushed straight through the fabric of the lab coat and sunk deep up to her wrist into its suddenly liquid, gelatinous form. She wrenched away from it, trying to draw her hand back but it pulled ever further in like quicksand made of flesh and cloth.
</p>
<p>
	TK screamed and placed her foot onto the side of the chair to try to force her arm back from its snare, but her foot instantly sunk into the side of the chair and the man’s leg, dropping all the way to the shin almost instantly and causing her to lurch forward enough to sink down to the elbow of her arm along with it.
</p>
<p>
	“NO! NO! PLEASE!! WHAT IS…WHY..” TK fumbled and screamed, her body melding into the silent, still form of the scientists upon his metal seat. She tried once more to yank away but felt the pull draw her further and further in.
</p>
<p>
	All at once the scientists arm lashed around and grasped onto TK’s other arm forcefully, it’s flesh melding directly into hers like two liquids meshing in a glass. The man’s head lifted only slightly, turning unnaturally on a seemingly broken neck to stare directly up at TK. For the first time since she arrived she now knew that this wasn’t the body of a man… but of a desiccated corpse. It’s eyeless holes, deep and dark as the abyss itself, stared blindly into her, drawing her further and further inward.
</p>
<p>
	TK tried to scream, but she wasn’t sure if the voice came out of her mouth any longer.
</p>
<p>
	—-----------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	Alyssa Medero sat in the middle of 7th Avenue, Whitesville Connecticut, on her knees. She rocked back and forth, her arms wrapped around the comatose body of TK - who had just gone straight up fucking super saiyan and blew up a platoon and a bunch of houses in the middle of white ass suburban USA. The thought that the Army could show up at any second had been ping-ponging around inside of her head since she had knelt down here. Or fuck even worse… maybe the NYPD would show up!
</p>
<p>
	“Yoooooo this shit is wild AND crazy, kid!” Dips the ghost of a radical 90’s skater dude yelled out unironically. He held his hands in his head and was looking around frantically trying to figure out what to do.
</p>
<p>
	“Just STOP for a second and THINK for once, you talking Trapper Keeper!” Alyssa yelled with a trembling voice, looking over TK to make certain she wasn’t hurt physically. “She’s out cold and it doesn’t look like she’s gonna come around anytime soon. I’m strong but there’s no way I’m gonna be able to carry her all the way across town to the car - we need some kind of escape plan and FAST.”
</p>
<p>
	“Whoa, that’s totally true, dudette! And I’ve got the perfect idea to get us outta this jam and pronto!” Dips spit ghostly saliva onto his hands and rubbed them together with a huge grin on his face and the fact he was a ghost made it absolutely no less disgusting that he did that. “Check THIS shit out, bro!”
</p>
<p>
	He threw one leg into the air and spun it around in place like a Tom & Jerry cartoon and then rocket launched his ghostly form up into the air. His body elongated and distorted into the long arc up and back down until it had gone completely into TK’s unconscious body in Alyssa’s arms. The light blue glowing teen extinguished completely and buried into the human body, causing TK to start convulsing in Alyssa’s arms then and there.
</p>
<p>
	“What the FUCK?!” Alyssa screamed out, barely holding onto TK as she rolled this way and that, jerking every muscle in her body in a way that very much mirrored the way your mom be jerking every muscle in MY body if you know what I mean and I mean sex. Which I’ve had.
</p>
<p>
	TK’s eyes suddenly shot open, glowing a light blue around the pupil instead of the normal brown color she sported. “Sup, dude!” she said nonchalantly, her voice seemingly overdubbed very slightly by a distorted, distant echo of Dips’ weirdly anachronistic So Cal Surfer voice.
</p>
<p>
	“AHHHHHH!!” Alyssa dropped TK’s body immediately, causing it to slam into the concrete as she backed away a couple steps to standing. She immediately lurched forward and held her hands out, “Oh, shit, TK, I’m sorry!”
</p>
<p>
	“Whoa…” TK’s body pushed up off the ground and slowly stood up into an awkward, jerky standing position. “Most uncouth. It’s me in here, Dips! TK’s still totally out of it so I’m gonna just meat puppet her outta town. Hope that’s like, sympatico and whatnot.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh my god this is wrong in every way I can think of…” Alyssa shuddered, her face contorted with disgust. “I guess it’s the best plan we’ve got…”
</p>
<p>
	She jogged across the street and picked up the slightly torched and torn apart remains of her duffel bag. “I saved so many Pepsi points…” she whispered under her breath, then shook her head and took the remnants of the bag and wrapped it around her shotgun to hide it from view. She took the short walk back over to Dips/TK, which is what I’m gonna use for shorthand because fuck explaining the whole possession situation every time I gotta fuckin have this character say a stupid 90’s one liner to finally catch a fucking laugh on this stupid fucking podcast. I mean for convenience sake. “Let’s get the hell out of here before–”
</p>
<p>
	But before was too late because it was now which was after before but before had passed before now could occur later. ….uh… so it was.. Now… which was when this was happening.
</p>
<p>
	Across the street two large steel doors emerged from the ground, slamming with the tell-tale sound of immense heft onto the torn up earth where the non-descript old building and its guardian militia had once stood.
</p>
<p>
	Alyssa narrowed her eyes and kept the duffel bag remnants full of pump action shotgun at the ready to her side.
</p>
<p>
	Three figures emerged from the earth below the ruins of the building, one by one into the open light of dusk. 
</p>
<p>
	The first was a massive white man with a blonde military flat top and deep set hateful eyes. He wore some kind of Party City military man costume it looked like since it didn’t have any insignias or logos anywhere on it and jackboots of the kind this type of stupid fucking redneck army cosplayer just can’t seem to get enough of.
</p>
<p>
	The second was another white man this time in a snakeskin jacket and boots with sunglasses and, I shit you not, a fucking pompadour hair cut with a green streak in it. Was this ACTUALLY cosplay from some kind of anime that Alyssa had never heard of before? Not that she watched a lot of anime that was for geeks and she was a cool biker chick so stop fucking thinking she would watch anime because she wouldn’t. Like, ever. Maybe like sometimes if it’s gory or something, she’d tell people sometimes and gauge their reactions, but that’s it.
</p>
<p>
	And a third honkey followed them out. Alyssa should’ve listened to her uncle about how all white people are evil, she guessed. This one had long flowing braided white-blonde hair and a flowy little sundress with poofy sleeves and all. She had the desire to say “What the fuck?” out loud but got the feeling that antagonizing three murder-crackers wasn’t the best idea right now.
</p>
<p>
	Of course we know who these three are by now I’d fuckin hope - Hawk, Snake, and Miller. But Alyssa didn’t know that so I thought I’d do a little something called “building a scene” for a change. I read about it online.
</p>
<p>
	“YOU BLEW OUR DAMN BASE UP!” Hawk screamed out, fists clenched as he took heaving footsteps towards Alyssa and TK/Dips. “I OUGHTA RIP YOUR SHIT OUT OF YOUR OWN ASS AND FEED IT TO YOU, MAGGOT!”
</p>
<p>
	“Fucking hell.” Miller said plainly, shaking her head at Hawk before turning her eyes back to the women across the street. “Roid rage aside, he’s got half a point, dears. You did blow up the building we were using as cover for our base. “
</p>
<p>
	“Fucking semantics, Miller? Really? You petty little bitch?” Hawk snapped back at her.
</p>
<p>
	“Look, ladies.” Snake walked nonchalantly across the street, hands in the pockets of his slacks. “One of you is an Esper. That’s a rare and valuable thing. If you were to surrender to us then we’d be more than happy to allow both of you to live. Such as it can be arranged.” 
</p>
<p>
	“These dudes are gonna do what to our shit?” Dips whispered through TK as he leaned over to Alyssa warily.
</p>
<p>
	Alyssa ignored him and took a step forward. “I don’t know who you are, but just let us go and we won’t ever come back here again! We didn’t know about any of this when we arrived! And if we can go then we still don’t know about any of this and no one else will either!”
</p>
<p>
	Miller narrowed her eyes and drew a smart phone out of the side pocket on her dress, drawing it up to her face and beginning to type in and scroll around. “I think we have a file on you two somewhere, hold on, don’t move a muscle.” She paused and worked a little on the phone before adding, “Or we’ll rip all of them out of you.”
</p>
<p>
	“I would appreciate it if you didn’t try that.” a deep voice broke the tension filled silence only a moment later.
</p>
<p>
	Every face turned as fast as they possibly could on that street at that moment to where the confident, casual voice had come from. Standing there in the middle of the street only a few yards down 7th Avenue, was a figure clad in a long black overcoat, with wavy black hair swaying ever-so-gently in the breeze.
</p>
<p>
	“What the FUCK?! This guy is still alive?! SNAKE?” Miller screeched out accusingly, throwing both of her hands toward the man in the overcoat like that Will Smith meme where he’s showing shit that went around everywhere before he slapped Chris Rock and people got pissbaby upset about that for whatever fucking reason and stopped using it.
</p>
<p>
	“I didn’t say I killed Tachibana…” Snake grumbled under his breath, peering over the top of his sunglasses. “Just said I won the fight, s’all.”
</p>
<p>
	“Not exactly how I remember it.” Ryo Tachibana said with a slight grin curling the edge of his lip.
</p>
<p>
	“There’s three of us and one of him! Let’s just rip him to pieces and have a meal out of it right now! Ain’t no reason to stand around yapping so damn much!” Hawk screeched out in frustration. 
</p>
<p>
	Alyssa and TK/Dips exchanged glances. The two of them had been standing there being ignored for this entire time and had just about decided that it would be totally worth it to just book it the fuck out of there while they had the chance. Neither of them understood a word of this unfolding little Power Rangers drama happening in front of them, anyway.
</p>
<p>
	But before either of them could make a move, the gigantic man called Hawk was in motion - and moving faster than either of them had ever seen anything move in their entire lives. It felt like a second or two had passed at most and Hawk had cleared the distance between himself and Ryo, leaping up into the air and heaving his massive fist down at the much smaller man.
</p>
<p>
	“HAWK DON’T!” Snake screamed out, but it was again, as is the cliche of my writing, too late to matter.
</p>
<p>
	Ryo ducked his body low and slid to the side of the oncoming punch almost too fast to even follow, his hand darting up and latching around the much larger man’s incoming fist. The leverage of the gigantic body coming at him and his low fulcrum point made it child’s play to smash the massive Hawk’s form directly into the hard concrete below them. The sickening smash of flesh and bone against stone reverberated down the long corridor of houses and an explosion of blood spiked out in a star pattern from Hawk’s skull striking the pavement.
</p>
<p>
	“Fuckin’ hell.” Snake said under his breath.
</p>
<p>
	Ryo took a step to the side. Hawk’s lifeless body flopped down onto the concrete, motionless in its own pool of blood.
</p>
<p>
	“You’re as good as The Master said.” Miller grinned ruefully at Ryo, rubbing at her chin. “I can see why you’re so damn important to him.”
</p>
<p>
	“None of that means a god damn thing to me.” Ryo said with narrowing eyes, starting a slow walk down the street toward Snake and Miller. “I’m going to kill every last one of you.”
</p>
<p>
	“You handle this Snake. Like you were supposed to to BEGIN with.” Miller glared with disgust on her face over to Snake now, who barely even acknowledged her in return. “I’m returning to Arklay momentarily. Try not to fuck this up this time, would you? I wouldn’t miss you for shit but there aren’t a whole lot of us Chrysalids left at this point.”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re welcome for that.” Ryo spat out with a grin, about halfway to the two of them at this point.
</p>
<p>
	But he had to stop, like everyone else did, when he heard the sickening sputtering bloody pop of bone behind him. He rolled his eyes and turned around to look back down the street. “Can’t any of you freaks ever just stay down?”
</p>
<p>
	Hawk’s corpse was shuddering, its body heaving to and for and bones beginning to break and meat tear within it. This was old hat to some of the folks gathered here, but Alyssa and TK/Dips watched with absolute horror as the corpse of Hawk began to split open like an eggshell, massive bladed wings emerging out of it like a surgery from the inside out. The thing within him clawed its way, bloody and screaming, into life - a gigantic twisted bird man with six eyes ranging up its elongated, distended head - which it threw back and screeched hellfire to the heavens upon its emergence.
</p>
<p>
	“Yo I can’t fuckin’ throw up cause this isn’t my body but BOY do I want to, dude!” Dips cried out from within TK, holding her hand over her mouth to keep from blowing chunks. He figured it’d be rude to get sick in a rental and all.
</p>
<p>
	Alyssa flung the tattered duffel bag off of her shotgun and leveled it at the pulsating blooding hawk monster that she had never even imagined in her nightmares but was now gonna keep her up at night for years if she managed to fucking survive all this hokey ass horror movie horse shit.
</p>
<p>
	“Fine then.” was all Ryo Tachibana said at the sight. He gripped onto the lapel of his overcoat and flung it off of his body in one sweeping motion which physically didn’t make any sense but badasses do it in animation and shit all the time so it still looked super cool and no one bothered to question it especially the podcast audience.
</p>
<p>
	By the time his overcoat had hit the ground, Ryo wasn’t standing there any longer. In his place was another heaving horrid beast straight out of the deepest recesses of the human psyche. Surrounded by the detritus of his human form and screeching at the top of its inhuman lungs was a seven foot tall cricket monster - its reverberating screen vibrating the mandibles which hung dripping from its open maw. The change had happened so rapidly that Alyssa and Dips/TK hadn’t even registered this one.
</p>
<p>
	“JESUS FUCK THERE’S TWO OF THEM!!” Alyssa screamed out and turned to start running.
</p>
<p>
	“This is getting out of hand!” Dips screamed through TK as he also began to run, unaware of the reference he was making because he died before that movie came out. Still a banger ref though, I would say.
</p>
<p>
	The two massive horrors slammed into each other hard enough to cause glass to shatter out of neighboring homes’ windows, the force sending Alyssa and TK/Dips to go flying, and skidding across the hard pavement. 
</p>
<p>
	They scrambled as fast as they could to their feet, their elbows and knees bleeding and scuffed but before they would even start running against they were flung from their feet once more by another gigantic beast slamming into the first two - this time a horrific spiraling serpent with blood gushing from it’s body as it was born anew only moments before.
</p>
<p>
	Finally they managed to their feet and started to run then, dipping across a long front lawn and back behind a few houses into alleyways and across driveways into the distance - trying as hard as they could to put distance and objects between them and the freakshow they were trying to escape.
</p>
<p>
	“What the freak WAS that, dude?!” Dips yelled through TK’s voice, looking back every few seconds to scope out was was going on. His running in her body was extremely awkward and jerky and always seemed like he was about to fall on her face at any second but he somehow maintained. “This CAN’T be real, man! It’s like B-Movie junk!”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re a GHOST BOY! A GHOST BOY!!” Alyssa screamed out, fighting every urge in her body to slap TK/Dips in the back of the head since this is the only time Dips would ever be able to feel it probably - but she didn’t wanna hurt TK.
</p>
<p>
	“Uh, touche’ bro.” was all Dips said in return, focusing far too much on piloting this unconscious meat puppet to clamber over a tall wooden fence at the back of an alleyway and over to land on the other side without breaking anything. It had been a LONG time since he’d had to worry about that kinda shit.
</p>
<p>
	All along the way they could hear roaring, screeching, hissing, the sounds of massive bodies slamming into one another, bursting through stone and wood - the sound of massive amounts of blood splattering onto concrete. It was a sickening orchestra that wouldn’t cease no matter how far they got away.
</p>
<p>
	“Where are we even going, brah? They said they got a file on you two so they for sure know where you’re staying!” TK/Dips finally concluded about three blocks away, both of them still running as hard as they could.
</p>
<p>
	“We’re just getting the car! Fuck our stuff, we can buy new stuff!” Alyssa screamed through huffs and puffs, cardio not being her kinda workout - she much preferred weight-lifting. “We gotta get TK to a hospital!”
</p>
<p>
	“Nnnnno hospital!” TK’s voice alone yelled out, beginning to catch herself running herky-jerkily and flattened out her pace and gait to run like a normal human being. She looked around frantically, as she did. Confusion writ across her face.
</p>
<p>
	“TK?! You’re awake?” Alyssa yelled, almost stopping running but then placing a hand on TKs shoulder and guiding her to continue her pace. “Keep running! Those horror show freaks are still fighting! Do you remember any of that?”
</p>
<p>
	“N-no! What the hell just happened?! Horror show freaks?” TK fumbled over her words, shaking her head as the two of them rounded around a corner and had to run across another open street to make it to the houses across the way for more cover.
</p>
<p>
	Dips’ non-corporeal form exploded out of the top of her head just like you imagine it would look like you fuckin’ dirty bird, you. But like, see-through. He swirled into the air and reformed into his normal human-adjacent form, shaking his head and going like “brrrrrrr” like a cartoon dog. “You got some ROUGH head space to try and survive in, sister!”
</p>
<p>
	“Tell me about it!” TK yelled, beginning to huff and puff herself. She wondered how long she’d been running by this point.
</p>
<p>
	Alyssa tried her best to explain what was going on as the trio now rounded a set of houses, crossed their backyards, hopped the fence, and ended up in the alley lane behind them.
</p>
<p>
	But all three stopped pretty instantly when they landed in the lane behind the fence and found themselves standing in the middle of a board room in an office building? There was a long mahogany table in the middle of the room, with chairs lining it on either side, each one inhabited by an old white man of some kind in a business suit, each of them glaring hatefully at the three sudden arrivals. A gigantic sign on the wall in neon lights behind them read “ARKLAY BAKERIES.” At one end of the table was a gigantic landscape window showing what looked like a large metropolitan city outside. At the other end, a gigantic chair sat with its back turned to the entire room, slowly rocking back and forth as smoke poured from behind it.
</p>
<p>
	“Uhm.. what the fuck is going on…?” TK whispered, leaning over to Alyssa who stood just as dumbfounded watching. “When did this story become Glengarry Glen Ross…?” she asked, referencing a movie that no one ever references in real life ever.
</p>
<p>
	“Please take a seat.” a feminine voice from behind the gigantic chair at the end of the room muttered. 
</p>
<p>
	TK and Alyssa glanced over the table to find two empty seats towards the middle of the endless rabble of old honkeys seated around it. They then looked over each other, noticing they were both dressed in fresh business suits and slacks with fine Italian shoes. None of this really seemed that out of the ordinary for some reason to them so they took their seats.
</p>
<p>
	The gigantic chair slowly turned around, revealing Miller seated with a cigarette dangling from between her ruby-red lips. She wore a business suit of her own, with wide fake shoulders and a pencil skirt. Her hair was twisted up into a very loose high bun and she wore a pair of thin round-framed glasses on the lower bridge of her nose. 
</p>
<p>
	“Very good.” she said with a smirk. “I hope you don’t mind that I smoke in here, they really frown upon it in the waking world these days.” she chuckled a little. “Not that this isn’t that or whatever, of course.”
</p>
<p>
	TK and Alyssa exchanged glances then turned back and smiled politely at their boss who had called this meeting, “Of course.” they said in unison.
</p>
<p>
	“Now what to do about these quarterly reports… We’re a chain of bakeries, my dears we’re in the business of MAKING dough… not losing it. I’m afraid the two of you might be under the axe for this…” she grinned from ear to ear, smoke cascading from her cigarette up around her features.
</p>
<p>
	“The axe!” every man in the room yelled at once, then fell to silence once more, continuing to glare at the two of them.
</p>
<p>
	“Baking…?” Alyssa mouthed to herself. For some reason she had been under the impression that they sold flowers. Didn’t they?
</p>
<p>
	“Oh uh… we… We prepared the quarterly as you requested! I’m… I’m pretty sure…” TK piped up then slowly sidled back into her chair, rubbing her forehead absently.
</p>
<p>
	—-------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	“Uh… are you two ok…?” Dips asked, floating in the middle of the alley between two high fences in the middle of suburbia. TK and Alyssa stood wall-eyed and mouth agape on either side of him, slowly shuffling back and forth and looking around as if they were seeing something there he couldn’t. He waved a translucent hand in front of each of their faces and then shook his head, “Major bad vibes, dudes. Most heinous.”
</p>
<p>
	“Like taking candy from a baby…” a distorted, distant voice flitted into the scene, causing Dips to recoil away from his two friends with widened eyes. Slowly floating down from the now darkening sky was an almost angelic being were it not for the intense waves of malice and fear it was causing to waffle through him at that moment. Ghosts can feel that kind of thing from everyone but he had never felt it this concentrated, this powerful.
</p>
<p>
	A feminine figure, draped in dozens of moth wings which encircled her from her ankles all the way up to almost her shoulders as a dress would, blood red spatters all over them, and two sets of almost unfathomably large wings which kept her aloft as she descended upon them in that lone alley just as night did. She would seem human at first glance, in silhouette, until the elongated, bladed feelers in place of her feet and hands, and the massive segmented eyes which drew up and around the sides of her head, barely parting the massively long white hair which flowed and split like an aura around her.
</p>
<p>
	She touched down and began to walk toward Alyssa and TK, slowly but surely.
</p>
<p>
	“Aw dude, bogus…” Dips floated above watching in absolute horror helplessly as the moth creature stepped up to his only two friends in the world and began to reach out toward them.
</p>
<p>
	“You I’ll keep… Snake is a blithering moron but he was right about one thing…” Miller drew up her segmented, bladed fingers and ran them ever-so-slowly across TK’s face, leaving behind small trails of blood from her touch in their wake. “An Esper is a rare and valuable thing indeed…”
</p>
<p>
	She then turned to Alyssa and grinned, her teeth elongated in her mouth and dripping a strange yellowy ooze down her chin as she opened her mostly humanoid lips. “You on the other hand… at least you’ll make for a decent meal…”
</p>
<p>
	TO BE CONTINUED
