	New York, New York, Fall 1934. Entry 10.
</p>
<p>
	If you ain’t read my previous entries then this shit is gonna be WILDLY confusing, just as a head’s up. I’ll try my damndest to catch you up to speed real quick though - 
</p>
<p>
	I got hired by a different stereotypically named Italian mob family than in the first story with the mummy to be a bodyguard during some kinda big hooplah deal with the Romanian Mob. Turns out they were trafficking in some kinda doomsday weapon called The Hydrogen Bomb which the Romanians said could level a city. The Italians were creamin’ their Versace silk underwear at the idea but a Party City ass Spirit Halloween witch busted in and hocus pocus’d me into a semi-human wrecking ball - I pretty much fucked the whole place up while she escaped with the princess of Romania who was also there for some reason? Look, I TOLD you none of this shit was gonna make any sense if you didn’t listen to last episode, I mean read my last case file. 
</p>
<p>
	Aaaaaaanyway
</p>
<p>
	The head of the Romanian mob delegation, some guy named Uchenko, which isn’t a Romanian name even slightly by the way, whoever named him oughta do some fuckin’ research once in a blue moon - anyway, Uchenko kidnapped me and told me I either get Princess Swarova back from the witch and return her to him safely or the King of Romania would have my head - or would attack America or somethin’? He wasn’t super specific. Either way it seemed pretty bad for me, so when he cut me loose I immediately set out to searching for where the witch could’ve taken her.
</p>
<p>
	Now I’m sure you’re chompin’ at the bit to hear exactly how I Sherlock Holmes’d my way to finding out where she’d gone and how she was hole’d up but I just spent like half a page explaining what happened last time on Dragon Ball Z to a bunch of rubberneckers who ain’t heard a word of my previous prose so I ain’t got no room to recount it anymore. Just rest assured it was smart as fuck and I was dashing and rogueish the whole time just like usual. 
</p>
<p>
	Man this is a bad opening… uh…
</p>
<p>
	Well, within the allotted 24 hours I was given by Uchenko I was standing next to a dirt road in the middle of nowhere upstate New York. I’d borrowed a car to get there, a shiny new DeSoto Airflow, from someone who I was hoping wouldn’t miss it for long enough for me to return it again this time. Not that I’d ever taken if before or anything but maybe don’t leave your keys in the glovebox? Basic security measures? 
</p>
<p>
	I was staring across a wide, empty field of overgrown grass at a sprawling mansion laid out across it. It must have once been a harrowing display of wealth and opulence but now it looked derelict, save for the tell-tale hazy green light that barely lit each window along its front facia.
</p>
<p>
	By this point, thanks to all the hell and high water I had to go through to get here, which again, I will not be recounting, I was pretty pissed off. All things considered I wasn’t even gettin paid anymore and my life was on the line so I figured I had good reason to be grumpy. I marched my happy ass across the field, taking care not to step into any snakes dens or big piles of caribou shit or whatever the fuck lived up here, and closed distance with the manor. 
</p>
<p>
	Pretty much the entire way I was worried somebody was gonna start poppin off gunshots from a high window or I was gonna step on some kinda land mine and get blown back into pieces across the lawn, but nothin’ ever happened. I made it to the front door in one piece, as much as could be said for me on any given day, and completely unharmed.
</p>
<p>
	Now you know me, Mr. Manners, I thought about knocking on the door for a tick but realized how fuckin’ stupid that would be and just shoulder rammed the entire thing off it’s hinges. The gigantic oak double doors flyew inside the building and across the checkerboard laminate floor like frisbees. Which probably haven't been invented yet. I’m not looking it up.
</p>
<p>
	“Holy fuckin’ cannoli!” I shouted out to nobody in particular, shocked at the sight before me inside the manner.
</p>
<p>
	In the center of the dilapidated old foyer was a massive green translucent cocoon attached to the floor and ceiling by what looked like pulsing, living musculature. There was some kind of thick, bubbling liquid inside of it and it was giving off an incredible amount of emerald green light - lighting up the entire foyer brighter than the candelabra that hung uselessly overhead. And floating in the very center of the massive shape, looking entirely out of place and puny compared to her surroundings was Princess Swarova of Romania, eyes closed and limbs hanging limply among the liquid.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, so you actually found me?” a voice called out from the top of the old half-caved-in staircase at the back of the room. I looked up dumbfounded to see the witch standing there on the landing, smirking down at me with black curved lips. “You’re smarter than you look.”
</p>
<p>
	I’d seen this woman a dozen times easy in the past week on billboards, posters, subway advertisements, lewd bathroom wall drawings, the works - she was known all over New York City for her myriad roles on Broadway, but now it turned out she was a real life fuckin’ witch. Ursula Redgrave, the Queen of the Stage, stood atop the flight of stairs, holding a glass of wine in one hand and a cigarette holder alight at its end with a hand-rolled stogie.
</p>
<p>
	Oh yeah, I forgot to mention in my preamble that the witch was the Broadway actress Ursula Redgrave, didn’t I? Maybe I oughta leave recaps to the professionals, I feel like I did a real bad job, my bad. Yeah, she’s Ursula Redgrave. That’s real important to the story.
</p>
<p>
	“Look, I’m not here to blow your brains out or nothin’, I’m here to retrieve the princess for the Romanians and be on my merry little way.” I called up to her, shoving my hands into my overcoat pockets. I went home and changed after I got released but that seems less important to the story. I’m only including it so I don’t get a “gotcha!” message on Discord. Er uh… on telegram I mean. BY telegram. Fuck.
</p>
<p>
	“Awww, isn’t that sweet. I’m afraid you’ll have to return to your employers empty-handed, Creature. I have plans for the little girl. Every witch needs an apprentice after all.” Redgrave smiled a rueful smile, bringing her wine glass up and sipping from it absently. “Why don’t you be a lamb and tell me how you found me?”
</p>
<p>
	“Nah nah nah, I’m not here to exposition dump to make up for bad writing, I told you why I’m here and I intend to see it through. Now hand over the girl before I have to get rough with ya.” I dumped my hand beneath the lapel of my overcoat and came out with my 357 Magnum, leveling it at her. She didn’t have to know I couldn’t hit the board side of the barn on a good day, after all.
</p>
<p>
	“Cute. But that bullet won’t reach me, you already saw that once today.” She laughed a loud, haughty laugh, and sat her glass down on the bannister in front of her. She waved a hand at me like shooing a pest. “But do go ahead. You haven’t a prayer of harming my plans either way.”
</p>
<p>
	I paused a moment and looked at her with that kind of expression that read “Bitch, are you for real?”, then turned the barrel of my gun toward the gigantic green pod in the middle of the foyer housing the seemingly lifeless body of the Princess. I barely registered Redgrave screaming out “No!!” before I’d squeezed the trigger.
</p>
<p>
	The bullet pierced clean through the outer shell of the form and popped it like an overfilled water balloon, sending the contents spilling out across the room at my feet like a deluge from a waterfall. I managed to keep my balance but couldn’t scoop the Princess out of the sludge fast enough as she slid past me in the current. 
</p>
<p>
	“You dumb fucking ape!” Redgrave screamed out, slapping her glass of wine out of her way with one hand and then vaulting over the bannister above me. She sailed down through the air as if on the current of wind, her hand outstretched toward me as she came.
</p>
<p>
	Her speed was insane but it was pretty much exactly like when someone throws a ball at you and you aren’t paying attention so you just slap it out of the air on instinct alone. I threw a wild haymaker that connected with the side of her head and sent her sprawling out across the floor amidst all the ooze. I gotta admit, I paused for a second to admire my natural athleticism.
</p>
<p>
	“Fuck!” she screamed, face down in the green liquid. But then immediately begin to laugh, deep within her chest. She placed her hands on the floor and pushed herself up and out of the ooze, cackling as loud and as clear as she could. The blow to her face had seemingly broken away whatever was passing as her actual skin, revealing beneath it a green, sinewy mass of pulsing flesh and muscle that barely resembled a human’s features. “You’re still missing the point, Creature! I must feed on her youth to keep mine but she’s not even the important part! You’re so goddamn stupid!”
</p>
<p>
	The liquid had drained out of the room for the most part, through the open front door and under doorjams around the foyer, and had left only a couple inches of standing wetness - which was your mom’s nickname in high school by the way. I took my opportunity to rush over to the Princess and turn her over so she didn’t drown face down. “Yo, you ok… uh… your majesty?”
</p>
<p>
	The little girl coughed up some of the green liquid and hazily opened her eyes, her voice strained and small when she finally whispered, “Th…the crown… get… the crown…”
</p>
<p>
	“This uh… “ I looked back at Redgrave who was back on her feet and stomping across the room in a fit of rage directly toward us. “This really ain’t the time for jewelry, Princess.”
</p>
<p>
	“Th…the formula… the crown has… it etched… inside…” she managed to choke out before her head turned sideways and limp, unconscious. 
</p>
<p>
	“The formula for WHAT?” I called to her, shaking her body, but she didn’t really move. 
</p>
<p>
	The witch’s hand sank into the flesh of my head, her touch burning against my skin and causing me to let out a pained yelp at the sudden intrusion. This broad was stronger than she looked, man, I can’t lie, she drug me across the floor and heaved me at the far wall like she was playin’ discus. I hit HARD, and felt some of my mis-matched ribs snap inside of me even as the wall gave out and I fell through it, rolling across the wooden floor of some kind of storage room.
</p>
<p>
	“F…for fuck’s sakes…” I muttered, pushing back up to my feet as best I could. The witch cackled from the other room, and I could barely see what she was doing through the hole in the wall my body had left, Wile E. Coyote style. The liquid on the ground swirled and created some kind of strange maelstrom in the air above her head as she moved her arms as if conducting it. 
</p>
<p>
	I decided, not unlike every other time I’m in some kinda physical danger, that a direct assault, head-on, was my best bet. No one ever mislabeled me a master strategist. I ran as fast as my old legs could take me across the wood floor, leapt and tucked in as tightly as I could to pass through the hole in the wall I’d left in my wake, and land on the other side. Pretty fuckin’ sick, right?
</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately it did lead directly to her throwing her hand out at me in the air and freezin’ me in place somehow. She dragged me through solid air without even touching me and just tossed me like an old fuckin’ sock into a hamper directly into the middle of the weird liquid maelstrom she had been formenting in the air above her.
</p>
<p>
	Turns out it was some kinda portal, a rift in space and time if I gotta get specific with the prompt, and I found myself outside again, except this time falling straight down toward the ground.
</p>
<p>
	BLAM!
</p>
<p>
	I hit like a ton of bricks, sending mud, dirt, and debris flying in every direction. The mud was cold as hell so it felt like diving dick first directly into the Arctic Ocean again, which didn’t dredge up the best of family memories if you catch my drift. Still, when I dislodged my head from the earthen ass it had been shoved up, I found myself half-buried in a god damn pig pen, surrounded by terrified hogs staring at me with their big empty marble eyes. 
</p>
<p>
	“Fuck off, Wilbur!” I screamed out, waving my hands in warning to keep them at bay. Something about the situation seemed extra terrifying and familiar in a way that tells me at least one of my bodyparts survived after a hog feeding, which chilled me right to the godamn bone. 
</p>
<p>
	With a little elbow grease I’d dislodged myself from my predicament and clambered over the old wooden fence keeping the hogs in. I looked around to try to find my exact place and could barely see, just over a thicket of old dead trees who had long shed their last fall of leaves, the dilapidated old mansion I’d been teleported away from. Must’ve been some kinda limit on how far she could send me. Pretty convenient for the story.
</p>
<p>
	This whole embarrassing debacle did give me an idea, though. And I had plenty of time to think about it on the long, long, pathetically long walk back across the fields toward the old mansion.
</p>
<p>
	When I was fairly close, every single window left even slightly intact in the old mansion suddenly exploded outward, raining glass down onto the overgrown yard on every side of the property.
</p>
<p>
	“Fucking… of course.” I grumbled to myself, and took off running on my aching old knees again. If you think your late 30’s, early 40’s is bad on your knees imagine running on knees dug up out of a fucking grave that lived a whole life, decomposed a lil’ bit, and  have been in your body for hundreds of years afterward. There ain’t no amount of Ben-Gay in existence to make that tolerable and here I was doing it for the second time today.
</p>
<p>
	By the time I’d run back through the front door the entire situation had changed and I couldn’t tell if it was for the better or not. Knowing my luck, I was betting on VERY not.
</p>
<p>
	Ursula Redgrave was floating in mid-air in the center of the foyer, her hands outstretched and wind flowing around her like she was the eye of a tornado. Invisible stripes of force firing out of her body in wide curves that struck against the walls of the house and shook them, sending every old knick-knack, loose board, painting, etc. flying away and exploding upon impact. Her raven black hair was snaking through the air like Medusa herself, who I really hope isn’t also real cause fuck me she would suck SO much ass to fistfight. 
</p>
<p>
	Even more surprisingly, directly adjacent from her, in pretty much the same exact pose, was Princess Swarova?! She was floating in mid-air, her hands outstretched as well, sending wave after wave of force out of her body as she glared with glowing green eyes at her kidnapper. They both seemed to be exerting force toward the small amount of space between them, playing tug-of-war with a small, glinting gold object in the air – the Princess’ crown.
</p>
<p>
	“Alright…uh… I’m gonna head out, I think.” I muttered, taking a few steps back toward the door.
</p>
<p>
	“Please, Mister!” Swarova called out, not turning her head away from the violent stare-down she was sharing with Redgrave in midair. “Please get the crown! Stop her! She’s after the formula, not me!”
</p>
<p>
	“BEGONE, CREATURE!” Redgrave screamed, a blade of wind peeling off her and slamming into my chest like a ten-ton truck crashing. I was sprawled out on the ground holding my fuckin’ booboo like a baby back bitch before I could even register what was happening. I tried to roll back to my feet but the power Redgrave was exuding was pinning me down to the ground like they had just decided “fuck it” and left the truck on top of me.
</p>
<p>
	I leveled my gun as best I could given all the wind and pressure building up in the room, but try as I might I couldn’t get a bead on Redgrave. I was a lousy shot in the best of circumstances and I wasn’t super keen on fillin’ the Princess of Romania fulla bullet holes before I returned her back home to dead ol’ King Dad. 
</p>
<p>
	Thankfully, I had thought ahead. I reached my arm out as best I could from the front door behind me. It was a stretch, but after a few seconds of straining I finally managed to lay my hand on it - the farmer’s pitchfork from the hog farm down the road. 
</p>
<p>
	I tried to line up the shot as best I could, mostly prone, knowing I’d have strength to spare if I ever had anything. I drew back my arm against the oncoming pressure and wind and then heaved it forward, letting my grip go just in time to see it sail through the air like a missile.
</p>
<p>
	And pierce directly through Ursula Redgrave’s midsection, sproinging back and forth from the sudden stop inside her guts like when Daffy Duck hits that wooden staff off the ground and it hits his beak and makes it vibrate in Robin Hood Daffy. What? That’s the only comparison I can think of! It works! It’s literature!
</p>
<p>
	“AAAAGGGHHHHH!!” the famous actress slash fucking witch screamed out, her voice echoing and hollow on the winds. She didn’t get another chance to speak as the pressure and force flying off of Swarova pressed inward on her and created a maelstrom of their own. I’ve never seen anything like this before so I’ll try my best to describe it but like…god DAMN man.
</p>
<p>
	Her body was sucked into the eye of the maelstrom like a boba pearl gets sucked through a straw in a tea. Her body folded in on itself like a fucking TV dinner tray after The Simpsons was over. She got Origami’d up inside of that shit like that weird flappy fortune teller paper thing girls made back in grade school to figure out which boy they were gonna end up with. It was fucking WILD.
</p>
<p>
	And then she was gone. Swallowed up by the rift entirely. The winds were gone and Princess Swarova slowly lowered back to the ground, on her own two feet. After a second or two passed the crown which still floated above fell straight down onto the floor with a metallic clatter.
</p>
<p>
	“Thank you, mister.” The little girl said with a dim smile, her harsh personality and monarchist upbringing not allowing her to feel happiness or have a personality. But apparently being a witch is ok.
</p>
<p>
	“Alright….alright. Let me… let me think.” I wobbled up to my feet, holding my head as the pain behind my eyes began to set in. Somethings thinking using a dry old criminal’s brain was rough, give me a break. I stood there for a moment as the little girl looked up at me stoically.
</p>
<p>
	“The crown has a formula etched into it? For the… uh.. The Hydrogen Bomb that Uchenko was talking about?”
</p>
<p>
	“Yes.” She turned and began to walk toward the crown.
</p>
<p>
	I pulled my best Johnny Unitas and outran her across the room though, snatching the crown up in my hands before she could lay a finger on it. 
</p>
<p>
	“That is mine!” she forcefully said, mostly in a flat tone.
</p>
<p>
	“Yo little lady if this shit can level a city then…” I placed my hands on either side of the crown and pressed inwards. Like I said, if I ever had anything, it’s the strength to do this kinda shit - it crushed into brittle dust and shards almost instantly. “Problem solved.”
</p>
<p>
	Princess Swarova stared, mouth agape, for a few moments. Then shook her head. “Ok. If that is the way you wish to play it. My father did not wish for that machine to ever be built, anyway.”
</p>
<p>
	“But Uchenko did?” I finally remembered I was supposed to be a detective and said.
</p>
<p>
	“And Redgrave.” she corrected, smiling only slightly. “She had a high profile buyer in Germany waiting for this formula. I’m sure they won’t be happy with her.”
</p>
<p>
	“Wait, she survived the fuckin’ fold and dry laundry service you put her through over there?”
</p>
<p>
	“Unfortunately. But she’s far away where she cannot reach either of us now. You needn’t worry.”
</p>
<p>
	“What about you? You’re a witch too? How in the fuck is THAT a thing? I feel like I came into a play right after second intermission and for once it ain’t my writing that’s causing the problem.” I rubbed at my head, the pain behind my eyes getting worse with every thought.
</p>
<p>
	“You needn’t concern yourself with any of this. Uchenko will kill you if you don’t return me to him within 24 hours, correct? We should get going.” Swarova said with a sly grin, walking toward the front door ahead of me. My headache was in full swing by then, so I didn’t argue. Honestly, the entire ordeal had left me with a hollow sense that it was probably for the best that I didn’t know any better.
</p>
<p>
	I returned Swarova to Uchenko, who was his usual pleasant self about the entire ordeal. He let me know in no uncertain words that I’d made an enemy of the entire Romanian mob. I chalked that one up alongside the entirety of the vampires on the planet, huge swathes of the Italian mob, an all-powerful Mummy, and my ex-wife and moved on.
</p>
<p>
	Princess Swarova assured me that her father would be thankful for my assistance, as well as for taking care of the bomb problem for him in a way that left his hands clean. I didn’t bother to ask any follow-up questions for my own health and safety but also because I just wanted to be fucking done with all of this shit already.
</p>
<p>
	By the time I’d gotten back to my office it was closing time already. So I unlocked the front door just to step inside and close business. The office was looking as dusty and near-foreclosed as always but it felt like a beautiful little slice of home after the day I’d had. 
</p>
<p>
	I walked through the front office where a receptionist is supposed to be working but I never bothered to hire one into my personal office and flicked the lamp on by the door. The walk across the room to collapse in a heap onto the couch in the corner felt like a lifetime but I made it and the squeaking of the metal beneath the cushions felt like a welcome home from a loving family member. Close as I ever got anyway.
</p>
<p>
	But the moment my back hit the seat, the phone on my desk started blaring. Par for the course, I guess. I considered letting it ring but the memory of not getting paid for the last two days work burned at the edges of my brain enough to light the fire under my ass. I hauled my girth up just like your mom did up her ass last night and headed over to answer.
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, what is it now?” I snarled into the receiver as I picked the line up. 
</p>
<p>
	“Is that any way to speak to someone for whom you are so indebted, Mr. Frankenstein?” a familiar voice filled me with a dread I hadn’t felt for a few weeks time pretty instantly. 
</p>
<p>
	“What’s the haps, Dracula? Eaten any new and interesting people recently?” I spat back in response in my normal friendly bantery way.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m calling to thank you, actually.” He soldier on, despite my buffoonery. “You’ve done me a favor, though you don’t really know it.”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re right. If I would’ve known, I wouldn’t have done it.”
</p>
<p>
	“Not half as clever as you think you are, Mr. Frankenstein. Still, I owe you thanks for returning Princess Swarova to her father alive.”
</p>
<p>
	“What do you care about some debutante making it back across the ocean to her fat cat father’s throneside?”
</p>
<p>
	“You do less research than the writer of Spookyvision, Mr. Frankenstein. I always care about the safe return of family.” He chuckled to himself.
</p>
<p>
	“Romania… of course. I really shoulda put two and two together on that one. “ I slapped my hand over my face and drug it down off my chin in frustration. “You old bats love to hang out  in Transylvania and shit out offspring.”
</p>
<p>
	“Quite. Either way, consider this the first step on the long, long, long road to make it back into my good graces, Detective. You will be doing favors for me without realizing it for as long as you live. Trust me… I know the exact date you die by heart.” I could hear the bloodthirsty grin spreading across his acrid features even through the phoneline.
</p>
<p>
	“How’s Eve doin’, by the way? She come around on me yet? I could do the whole flowers and candy thing if that’s what it’s gonna take.”
</p>
<p>
	“Uh… what?” he replied in such a way that let me know I’d wiped the smugness off his face completely, which made me smile instead.
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, Eve still works for you right? I’m thinking of seeing if the ol’ Erector Set still works with her if you catch my drift. Haven’t cranked that bad boy up to speed in a loooooong time, I’m not ashamed to say.”
</p>
<p>
	CLICK. Errrrrrrrrrr
</p>
<p>
	The line went dead. I laughed for the first time in a long time, set the receiver back on the hook and the phone back on the desk, and promptly fell the fuck to sleep for about two days.
</p>
<p>
	The moral of the story? Fuck I don’t know. Uhhhh… be careful what jobs you take because you might end up accidentally working for Dracula without realizing it?
</p>
<p>
	Don’t underestimate young people? They might actually also be witches and be able to help you defeat a different witch?
</p>
<p>
	As always, maybe the moral of the story is to get paid up front…
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
