Myrtle Smellie vs. The World

Prompts: Echoes & Fathers

By Jeff Pennington

Excerpt from the Case Files of Adam Frankenstein, Private Investigator.

New York, New York, Fall 1934. Entry 8.

The man who was callin’ himself Dracula stood stone-still staring out that window at the vibrantly crimson moon hanging in the air outside the highrise. He hadn’t moved an inch in what felt like a lifetime and I’d just been standin there with my metaphorical thumb up my ass the whole time - my ex-fiance’s gun pressed against the back of my skull notwithstanding. I admit, I was gettin’ pretty antsy about what was supposed to happen next.

“So uh… could we ring up the chinese joint around the corner and get a quick bite or is one’a you gonna off me soon? I’ve got a full schedule goin’ on sooo..” I said, looking between Mr. Deville, which was Dracula’s fake name he was running this business by if you didn’t read my last entry for some dumbass reason, and the corpse bride that rat bastard Victor cooked up for me before literally cooking it in a house fire.

She got better though, I guess, cause she was standing there now, itchiest trigger finger I’d ever seen before, barrel to the back of my head, and aggravation in her voice turned up to max, “Shut the fuck up, you sorry sack of shit! If I had my way I would’ve painted these walls with your brains like a Picasso by now. The Count wants you to witness the coming of our new world first, though.”

“The Count?” I blurted out, shaking my head in disbelief at my own situation. “I still can’t wrap my head around this old prick bein’ the real life Dracula, straight outta the Bram Stoker novel. Just don’t make much sense to me that that’s a real thing.”

I could see Deville’s shoulders raise, the tension in them was obvious. I’d hit a nerve, maybe? I couldn’t hide the little grin that slid across my face at the thought.

Eve pressed the barrel harder into my head and grinded it against the skin, sending sharp waves of pain shooting through my skull. “Shut UP already! God, all you do is TALK! Why couldn’t you be more like the movie version of you and mute your fucking mouth?”

“Look, all I’m sayin’ is that Dracula is a fictional character, yeah? How do you square the fact that this mook says he’s the flesh and blood version of some pointy-toothed palooka that a broke, drunk opium addict made up on a whim to sell paperbacks? You gotta be shittin’ me, honestly.” I huffed, shrugging.

Deville spun around all at once, pointing a crooked, hateful finger at me and screaming out, “YOU’RE THE EXACT SAME! It’s the same fucking premise! There was a book called Frankenstein too, you fucking degenerate, brainless oaf! And yet here YOU stand! You cannot possibly be this oblivious! You can NOT be this un-self aware!”

Instantly without him cultivating it, the moon flickered and began to slowly drain off its reddish tint in the sky behind him, lightening and cooling against the black of the night. Deville’s eyes widened as he stared at me, realizing my ploy, and then flung his entire body back around to stare back up into the night’s sky once more. The tint of the moon began to sharpen once more under his gaze, burning and twisting back into its almost painfully red hue at the beck and call of the vampire king.

“Ah… a diversionary tactic. You are indeed more clever than I would give you credit for, Detective. I won’t make the same mistake twice.” he said, calmness returned to his deep oaken voice.

“You can’t blame a fella for tryin’.” I said as nonchalantly as I could manage. I finally took a moment to look around the room a little closer then. I hadn’t noticed up until that point but there was a pretty sizable mirror off to our right, built into the gilded golden wall of the office. It was a cute parlor trick that I couldn’t see Deville in it at all, but I did see a pretty clear view of Eve standing behind me holding the gun. I’d keep that in mind moving forward.

—-----------------------------------------------------------------

Kayla S. Hunter, her teaching assistant Myrtle Smellie, and the last man she’d ever want to have to share a tent with her in her entire life Pavlov Flinch had managed to make it across the town of Whitesville, Connecticut undetected thus far. It wasn’t quite the accomplishment you would think though, as not a single soul had been on the street the entire journey.

The twisting concrete steps that led up the hill to the Town Observatory led them onward, each of them on guard as best as they could muster. Kayla had lost her cane sword during all of the commotion of the fight with Mr. Cornwallis and Mr. Nero and was feeling particularly naked without a weapon going into all of this. She was walking as crouched as her knees would allow her at her age, eyes darting quickly in every direction as they approached -but again, finding no one in sight.

Pavlov Flinch was crouched as best he could manage as well, though he had spent most of the trip digging around through his pockets for the packet of Big League Chew he’d brought along for ‘emergencies’ whatever the fuck that meant. He’d come up with an empty bottle of pills marked “Not Boner Pills” and a ticket stub to the Barbie movie that hadn’t even come out yet somehow? But no gum. Kayla was having trouble keeping him quiet and he became more and more whiny and pissy about not being able to “feel like a real big leaguer” with his chew. No one was sure why he wanted that right now.

Myrtle was walking fully upright with one hand in her jacket pocket and the other holding her phone up into the air and maneuvering it around searching for bars of wifi. She’d mentioned at the beginning that she needed to check how many new views and reviews her Supernatural fanfiction had finally gotten to but she’d been quiet ever since, which was enough for no one else to speak to her again. It had perhaps been the longest amount of time Kayla had spent without hearing her grating fucking horseshit since meeting her so she was thankful.

As they approached the Observatory they could hear the low din of deep throaty chanting from within and could see the eerie green glowing lights which danced against the windows and traveled along the grounds outside. They did their best to avoid the light and approached the front doors, expecting guards outside to have to deal with in one way or another… but there was no one.

“There aren’t any guards…? What the fuck is going on?” Kayla whispered, stopping beside the sign reading “Whitesville Observatory Main Pavillion” near the completely unguarded front doors.

“Maybe they went into the bushes to take a tandem shit.” Flinch offered, stopping just behind Kayla and tossing a shit ton of empty wrappers onto the grass beside him from his pockets - like an unconscionable amount of wrappers. “That’s when two best friends get the tummy rumblies at the same time and–”

“I fucking get what it is, you sick little fuck.” Kayla stopped him, abruptly.

Myrtle just walked into the two of them, tripping over their crouching bodies and rolling into the sign, causing a loud metallic thud from the weight of her hitting it, “FUCK” she yelled on impact.

“Myrtle god damnit!” Kayla whisper-yelled, grabbing her up by her armpits and standing her back up.

“Watch where you’re going, I’m doing real work over here!” Myrtle groaned out, lifting her phone back up to try to steal the observatory’s wifi. “My Dean Winchester times Satan times Myrtle fanfiction is probably up to a BILLION reads by now! I posted it this morning!”

“THAT’S what you were writing on your phone the whole car ride?!” Kayla exclaimed. She caught herself a second later, holding a single finger up. “ Y’know what? I’m not gonna get sucked into your foolishness again. We’re here for a reason.”

“Narratively I’m not sure that reason is entirely clear anymore.” Flinch muttered, peering around the sign at the front door then looking back at the others. “I mean… the fake Cold put us together to do this but now we’re just doing it anyway? I don’t really feel a through-line of a story in this.”

“Let’s just fucking go.” Kayla said, rubbing the bridge of her nose before turning and walking up to the front door and slowly pulling it open and peering inside.

The foyer was dark, but the light’s beyond the open observatory roundabout were bright enough that it didn’t seem foreboding. Not a single person stood in the foyer either, not a single guard posted. Kayla motioned for the other two to follow her and slid through the dark to the huge  archway that led further in.

The three knelt at the edge of the light and stared into the massive round room at the center of the observatory. All of the museum style exhibits and cases had been pushed back against the walls, creating a massive open space which was populated by literally hundreds of people, standing shoulder to shoulder like sardines packed in a tin, staring stock-forward to the center of the room in their red and white robes - each one adorned on its hood by a strange jagged symbol of an eye. The room was split in two, straight down the middle, by a long carpeted walkway with no one standing upon it. It had been laid down haphazardly to lead from the entrance all the way to the raised platform at the center of the room. There one was meant to look into the eyeglass of the incredibly massive telescope which dominated the space above and out of the split ceiling into the air.

Every fifth or sixth robed cultist held in their hands a green glass lantern with a flickering candle inside of it, the green reflection of the lights dancing around the room even as they all stood perfectly still, humming and chanting a deep poem lost to the ages.

Kayla squinted at the raised deus at the center of the room and saw three figures upon it. A woman lay upon a stone platform which had just been dropped on top of the platform without thought of placement, a red and white robe just like all the others laying splayed open over her arms and nothing else, her nakedness stark and white against the fully covered congregation.

Another woman stood to the side, holding one of the strange lamps but this one with a crystalline red glass over it, burning brighter than all the rest, her body fully covered in the cloth.

And standing in the center a tall thin man with all the same robed eeriness, but with the added spectacle of a hideous, semi-living mask over his face. The strange black flesh of it pulsed, flaking gold off like old skin, and an oozing purple liquid slowly poured from the mask's blank black eye holes and twisted, empty mouth and nostrils.

Kayla was about to turn to speak to her… friends wouldn’t be the right word. Enemies was closer but it didn’t make sense why they would work together then. Frenemies? God, she hated that term. People seemed like a stretch considering one of them was a walking corpse and the other was… well, Pavlov Flinch. Let’s just say compatriots. She was about to turn to speak to her compatriots when the heavy wooden double doors they had opened to enter slammed violently shut behind them.

Kayla, Myrtle, and Flinch all turned, surprised into action, at the boomingly loud sound of the doors shutting and then quickly looking back into the room- hoping beyond hope that no one had heard that above the deafening din of chanting and humming… but every set of eyes in the massive room were now upon them, staring.

“Uh… housekeeping?” Flinch stuttered out.

“...god you suck.” Myrtle groaned.

“Ah… our honored guests have finally arrived!” The man in the mask at the center of the congregation called out, his voice echoing through the massive open room near endlessly. He raised his hands high into the air as he called and the glint on the jagged kris dagger in his hand revealed it to the startled three he was motioning to - the same kind of sacrificial dagger the last leader of a ritual had in his possession.

“...uh…” Kayla muttered, staring wide-eyed.

Every cultist in the room began to clap suddenly. An uproarious applause that filled the entire building and hurt Kayla’s ears, causing her to recoil slightly. They clapped with a fervor of appreciation in perfect unison that bordered upon the fanatical. And then, all at once, they stopped.

“Welcome! Kayla S. Hunter… and Pavlov Flinch…” The man in the mask called out once more, applause exploding in the room once more to a near-deafening level.

Kayla turned to run, but two robed figures emerged from the darkness behind them, holding in their grip two machine guns which they brandished with a wave to push her back with her compatriots into the full light of the main room.

“Our dear friends… you have tried to stop our ascension once before and somehow succeeded though we know not how. This is not how tonight will go, I assure you.” The masked man yelled across the cavernous room, voice echoing harshly, as the three interlopers were guided down the long, empty walkway at its center toward the deus at gunpoint.

“I am Father Marcus. This is my beautiful wife Anita.” the masked man waved his hand through the air to motion at the robed woman standing to his side holding the blistering bright red lamp. She drew one hand up and swept her hood off from her shoulders, revealing her slightly haggard but still youthful features.

As before Anita is played by Melissa Joan Hart or one of the Sister Sister twins, whoever is more hard up for money at this point.

Aaaaanyway

As they arrived at the foot of the deus, the two gunman stood directly behind Flinch and Kayla, guarding them as they looked up at their captors. Father Marcus squinted through the oozing purple liquid which rolled down the cheeks of his pulsating flesh mask like tears of inhuman blood, then looked back at his congregation, “Who the fuck is this?” he yelled, pointing at Myrtle.

Everyone in the room exchanged glances and then shrugged at one another. One man near the back raised his hand up.

“You don’t have to raise your hand, we’re not in school. “ Father Marcus sighed, shaking his head. “What is it?”

The robed figure that raised his hand slowly lowered it shamefully and then walked out into the carpeted walkway leading down the way. He began walking toward the deus.

“...can you like… jog or something, please? We’re kind of on a timetable here…” Anita finally said, pushing the sleeve of her robe up to glance at her watch.

The robed figure jogged a little and half-speed walked a little, inciting an obviously over-dramatic eyeroll from Anita. When he finally arrived he huffed and puffed for a moment before drawing his own hood back - revealing the face beneath to be none other than Mayor of Huntington, WV - John T. Billiams. Kayla and Myrtle exchanged glances at the reveal.

“Your grace, the little blue-tinged girl was one of my recruits back in Huntington. I could’ve sworn we killed her but I guess it didn’t take. She’d gone through the rituals necessary for ascension but never completed the metamorphosis so she must have survived her own death.” Billiams exposited a bunch of information we already knew.

“Well throw her out or something, we don’t have time for her right now.” Father Marcus waved Billiams off dismissively.

Billiams pointed at two men near the aisle in robes who immediately ran out into the middle of the aisle and lifted up Myrtle by her arms.

“HEY LET GO YOU FASCIST FUCKS! You aren’t cops, you can’t infringe my freedoms like this and get away with it!” Myrtle screamed, kicking her legs as they carried her back towards the front doors. “ALSO FUCK J.K. ROWLING!”

The two robed figures kicked open the front doors and fucking flung Myrtle out of them like Uncle Phil launching Jazz every episode of Fresh Prince, then slammed the door shut behind her. As they walked back toward their spots in the congregation one said to the other, “I like JK Rowling, personally. I loved Harry Potter.” the other shook his head and said in return, “Well we’re in a death cult bent on the end of the world so you would, right?” “Oh… yeah. Right.” the other returned.

“Ms. Hunter… Mr. Flinch…” Father Marcus said, kneeling down at the edge of the raised platform and looking down upon them as he spoke. “We are, all of us, here to ascend… to become our true selves. The angels abandoned upon this world, spurned from God’s holy light, were markers for our evolution. We will take their places in the kingdom of Heaven as reward for finally birthing God’s final son upon our reality. The Umbralborn shall not be denied its first breath again…”

The entire room was suddenly filled with the sound of deep voiced chanting once more, every member of the congregation raising their hands to the sky and staring with wide, bloodshot eyes through the split roof of the observatory. Anita walked over to the half-naked woman upon the gigantic marbled stone atop the deus and held her lantern aloft above her.

“Ah… it is time.” Father Marcus said, walking to the center of the platform and beginning to chant along with everyone else in the room.

The moon that hung so low in the sky as to devour the night itself filled the space between the massive steel bevels of the dome as they began to split further apart, opening up the sky for everyone inside to see. The pale celestial figure that stood still above all of them was suddenly changed by their words on the chill night’s air. As a pool of placid water that was hit by a droplet, the surface of the moon began to ripple and sway and change.

“Dominus…. Dominus…. Dominus…” the voices of the Acolytes of the Third Birth began to chant in unison, from a dull murmur to a cacophonous scream. Father Marcus stepped forward and took Anita’s place over the intended, pushing her aside gently. He drew his blade up into the air, its reflection of the moon being bright blood red instead, and began to scream those words himself.

“NO….! STOP HIM…!” Kayla screamed out, trying to lunge forward but being grabbed and restrained by the robed cultist with the machine gun behind her.

The blade came down hard and fast into the half-naked woman’s chest, sending a flashing splay of crimson blood flying through the air in its wake. The very instant the blade pierced flesh the moon ripened and darkened, it’s surface slithering and swirling over itself, being pulled taut and wrenching like flesh under its weight - changing it’s hue from cool and unassuming to a violent, unmistakable red.

“LET OUR SAVIOR BE BORN UNTO US THIS NIGHT…!” Father Marcus cried out in religious ecstasy, his knife trailing blood as he raised his hands to the communion.

New York, New York, Fall 1934. Entry 8.

I couldn’t figure out exactly what he was doing as he stood there staring at the blood moon that hung in the sky above the gigantic windows of his penthouse. Was there like some kinda hocus pocus Houdini shit goin’ on I couldn’t see? He was just starin’. That seemed like all he needed to do to keep it red - whatever the fuck that was for. Somethin’ was apparently happening 90 years in the future but fuck me if I had any idea. I have to admit, I wasn’t exactly payin’ full attention when he exposition dumped me.

“So what happens to you once he’s blotted out the sun forever, sweetheart?” I asked Eve behind me, keeping an eye out of the corner of my eye at the mirror across the room we were reflected in.

“What’s it to you? There won’t even be enough left of you for worm food by the time it matters.” Eve said plainly, holding the gun against my head perfectly in place. No opening.

“I mean you’ve outlived your usefulness, is what I mean. What use has a vampire got for a patchwork corpse with rotten blood?”

“He promised me free reign in the new world.” Eve spat back at me virulently. “I’ll be a queen.”

“Ha!” I feigned a laugh. “You gotta be fuckin’ with me. Did Victor forget to put your brain back in your skull before he sewed it up?”

“Oh fuck off with this psychology bullshit, Adam. You’re not gonna turn me against him. You couldn’t turn me anything if you were a god damn tornado.”

“Look, alls I’m sayin’ is maybe you oughta get that in writing with a notary public or somethin’.”

“What?” she said, tilting her head with frustration on her face. “What good would a notary public be in Vampire World? Where Vampires rule everything?”

“So get a vampire notary public or somethin’, what I gotta figure out your whole life from here on out for you?”

“What the fuck are you TALKING about?! VAMPIRE NOTARY PUB– are you on fucking opium right now Adam?” She twisted her wrist and moved the gun just enough away from my head to be the only opportunity I ever saw comin’ in this life - so I took it.

I twisted my body around to half-face her as suddenly as I could, reaching out and snatching at the gun in her hand. She wrenched her arm back but it wasn’t quite enough, I got a handful of the barrel.

The gun went off, sending a seering hot reminder of our time together through my left shoulder and hitting the bone. I’m a guy who’s felt a lot of pain in my life, but if anyone ever tells you they didn’t feel something like that then they’re lyin through their crooked teeth to you. I yelped out like a hit dog, but managed to pull the gun free from her hand.

Now I’m personally not the type to lay hands on a dame. I mean there was a couple times I choked them to death but that was a whole lifetime ago. I’m a changed man-monster these days. I include this little addendum here because you can imagine what I had to do next. It took three good hits to the temple before she crumpled on the ground like folded laundry.

I turned my attention to good ol’ Dracula at the window and you know the most fucked up bit? He still hadn’t broken eye contact with the moon. It’s like he hadn’t heard anything that had gone on up until that point. I suppose his Houdini shit took more attention than I figured before? Again, fuck if I know. But I did know I had to put a stop to it - if not for 90 years in the future or whatever just because I didn’t fuckin’ like the guy.

I leveled the gun at the back of his head and squeezed the trigger. Now I’d love to embellish here and tell you I deadyed him like Dick Tracy but I’ve never been a good shot. Somethin’ to do with my eyes not having depth perception cause they aren’t a set or somethin’. I shot out one of the windows, a portrait on the desk, and a lamp before I finally hit my target. The bullet pierced the back of his head and came out the front of his right eyeball  - splattering it all over the window in front of him and causing him to screech out an ear-splitting, hateful sound the likes of which I’ve never heard.

He dropped to his knees onto the plush carpet below and held his head in his hands, slow-moving blackened ochre blood falling from between his gnarled fingers.

By the time I looked back up at the moon in the sky, it was its normal bright, cool pale blue and nothing stirred on its face any more. I still couldn’t figure what had happened, and still had no clue or concern for 90 years in the future, but I felt pretty good about fucking his eye up at least.

I figured now was as good a time as any to cheese it the fuck out of there before I got Vlad the Impaled so I took the opportunity. I barreled through the door and splintered it into a million pieces and hoofed it as best I could all the way down an assload of stairs. Running up stairs sucks ass but those little tippy-tap steps you gotta take to run down stairs always feels bad, doesn’t it? Somethin’ undignified about the whole thing.

Anyway, I could hear him screaming after me in a bloodcurdlingly hateful screech the entire way down the stairs, the echoes beating against the walls of my own brain as well as the concrete stairwell walls. It always felt as if he was one step behind me the entire way, but the feeling of the madness swelling in the sky above us was at least waning.

—-------------------------------------------------------------------------

“W-what is happening?!” Father Marcus screamed out, the gasping screams of the congregation filling up the opened dome of the observatory soon after. They all stood transfixed at the sky above as the red within the moon began to run out, like a hole was pierced at its bottom, the fleshy-movement beneath it dragged out from within and relinquished as it drained.

“No, no, no, no…!” he screamed, pointing down into the audience below. “Grab Kayla or Flinch and bring them up here! We’ll sacrifice one of them to re-blood the ritual! We will be victorious still…!”

The guards holding their machine guns in one hand each grabbed both Kayla and Flinch by their arms, causing both of them to be jerked backwards. The sudden movement caused Flinch’s side pocket to smack against his belt in just such a way… that the final bullet in the revolver in his pocket went off, firing straight down through his overcoat into the robed cultist’s foot.

The cultist threw his head back in a loud, pained scream, dropping his gun on the floor in a clatter. The other guard instinctively opened up fire, his gun held almost directly against Kayla’s back. But to almost everyone in the room’ surprise, the bullets ripped through the jacket but were ejected back out into open air almost immediately on the other side with a loud, metallic PING!

Kayla spun on her heel, using the confusion of the moment to spinkick her guard in the chin and send him spilling backward onto the floor in a heap with one well-landed strike. She dove then, sliding across the floor and snatching up the machine gun from it, turning and firing it pretty much willy-nilly into the crowd of cultists.

Screams raised up not of anguish as before but of fear and pain as the bullets sprayed into the crowd for only a moment, dropping two or three cultists and sending the rest of them running for the fucking hills.

She slid her hand up and under her leather jacket, yanking a connection free unseen beneath, and returning a round silver shield in her hand - the front of it covered in sickeningly spiraling shapes like an organic maze, leading to a central point on the shield with a strange, otherworldly symbol upon it. The same silver shield she had picked up in the strange horrific city beneath Huntington, WV had now saved her life. And was currently being swung around like a battering ram, slamming into the heads of any cultist mad enough to make a dash for her and Flinch, as she protected them both with it.

“God fucking damnit…!” Father Marcus screamed, looking around frantically for another sacrifice. His empty socketed mask eyes stopped on Anita standing at the other side of the deus.

“N…no dear. We’re perfect together aren’t we? We found each other that cold Christmas Eve… and we made a family…! You can’t… “ she whimpered, stepping away from him with her hands up.

Father Marcus simply drew his blood dagger her and violently grabbed her by the arm and yanked her down onto the stone sacrificial slab, right next to the dead body of the previous sacrifice. “Yes dear! You will bring about our glorious ascension! And we thank you for your sacrifice! Kisses!”

Father Marcus drew his knife up into the air, one swift strike of it to re-awaken the blood moon and bring about a newly unstoppable armageddon and then–

Glass shattered in the gigantic side window of the observatory dome, splintering into the room in wide, swirling arcs. Exploding into the room was a Ford F-150 with a ladder on the back of it, sailing through the air and then smashing into the side of the gargantuan telescope at the center before spiraling off into the dispersing crowd and sending dozens of them flying in its wake, bouncing across the room and against the walls from its force.

The massive telescope swung from the weight of the truck hitting it, the mechanisms holding it in place exploding apart and flying in every direction. The gigantic steel form fell straight down, obliterating the raised platform in the center of the room, and landing directly on top of a screaming Father Marcus whose body was instantly crushed into a fine, bloody paste under the incredible size of the machinery.

The cultists who had not been filled with machine gun bullets or killed via indoor vehicular manslaughter filed out of the observatory onto the streets and into the night, running for their lives and away from the carnage, leaving only the silent, empty, and utterly destroyed Observatory behind.

Kayla and Flinch stood together in stunned silence, staring at the Ford F-150 wrecked in the center of the room, and the dead bodies splayed out all around them on the floor.

“....I think I pissed.” Flinch murmured.

“Yeah…” Kayla said blankly.

The door of the F-150 creakily swung open, dangling off of only one of the hinges at the bottom, revealing a sign that read “Marcus Repair Service” painted on the side of it. And from within the driver’s seat, pluckily hopping down onto the floor of the room with a gigantic smile and a big cheesy thumbs up, was none other than Myrtle Smellie.

“I FUCKIN’ RUUUUULE!” Myrtle screamed, throwing up devil horns with both hands and jumping up and down in place. She then began to violently shred on an air guitar, mimicking the sound effects of jamming with her mouth. “FUCK EVERYBODY WHO ISN’T ME! I’M THE FUCKIN’ COOLEST IN THE WORLD! YYYYEEEAAAHHHH!”

“a....alright…” Kayla muttered out, coming out of her complete and utter astonishment at what just fucking happened.

After what felt like an eternity of watching air guitaring Flinch looked around anxiously, “Can we FINALLY leave now? I haven’t even had any Big League Chew in like 4 hours now!”

“.....IF YOU FUCKING BRING UP BIG LEAGUE CHEW ONE MORE GOD DAMN TIME!!” Kayla screamed out in the middle of the wreckage left by all the carnage.

“I just saved the world and this is what you two bozos are gonna focus on? Tell me how awesome I am RIGHT NOW! Compare me Katniss Everdean RIGHT THE FUCK NOW!” Myrtle began to throw a tantrum, and everything in the world was back to normal once more.

—---------------------------------------------------------

Excerpt from the Case Files of Adam Frankenstein, Private Investigator.

New York, New York, Fall 1934. Entry 8.

By the time I’d made it down to the street the night was completely quiet again. Just the chirping of bugs at the corners and the occasional cat screeching when a neighbor throws a boot at it for doing a big cartoon song and dance number on a back fence.

I hailed a late night cab and sat pretty quiet with my thoughts on the way home. I’m a pretty clever guy but I have to admit I didn’t have clue one on what had really gone down at the Dusk Corporation that night.

I was trying not to think about the repercussions of crossing Dracula when I started to hear a strange sound at the edge of my hearing - like someone whispering from the next room - except I was sitting in a cab with the smelliest driver this side of Jersey trying to tell me about his newest invention - some kind of fancy radio with a picture on it or somethin’. I told him he should stick to drivin’ a cab.

Eventually the voice got louder and louder, until it was like the talker was sittin right next to me, right in my ear. Even after only a night of knowing him, it was unmistakable whose voice it was. Mr. Deville himself. Dracula.

“You haven’t stopped my machinations, Mr. Frankenstein. You’ve simply delayed them. You see, no king has ever sat upon a throne for long who did not have a plan for all contingencies. This was simply one of many. What you have succeeded in doing is creating a sizable blood debt for yourself. One I very much intend on seeing to its fruition very, very soon. We will see each other again, Mr. Frankenstein, at the time and place of my choosing. I will have my eye on you until then. Sleep well.”

The voice faded away as it had come, and I was left in silence. That debt would come back to haunt me, if you were wondering. But that’s another story altogether. I’ll get to it, I’ll get to it.

The moral of the story on this one? Maybe it’s as simple as “Curiosity killed the cat.” Or maybe “the cadaver”?

Either way.

Case Closed

—-----------------------------------------------------------

Like the end of The Lord of the Rings, the endings kept happening.

Anita woke up laying on the cold, hard ground of the Whitesville Conservatory, the bright light of morning streaking in from the wide-open dome above her. Splintered, broken machinery lay around her in heaps and piles, and bloody robed bodies lay scattered across the room in every direction she looked. She felt a sudden revulsion at seeing them, a desire to scream and run away, but it was supplanted in that moment as she looked down at herself and then around the room again.

How long had she been here? She remembered coming into town for Christmas to claim a house her grandfather had left her in his will. She remembered there being some legal questions about why she was the heir - the answer seemingly being that she was his only living female relative at the time. The reasoning for that had become clear when she arrived and found herself the object of male desire. Time had become lost to her after Christmas Eve… everything was all a blur.

She stood up and rubbed at her temples, trying to escape the strange cloudiness in her head that she felt was finally lifting after a long, long time. How long, she couldn’t possibly know.

“I’m…” she muttered to herself, looking at her hand for a moment. “Anita… Anita Strongman!”

“My god… how long have I… what has become of my life…? I…I… “ She turned her hand over in the light and saw the watch dangling from her wrist. She glanced at the face and noted the time on it. “Oh wow… I’m so late for work!”

She dusted her tattered, shredded red and white robes off and took off at a power walk through the front doors. “I gotta call an uber and get back to the big godless bustle of the city! The Peterson Account isn’t gonna close itself, I gotta get the paperwork going on the acquisition if I’m ever gonna make Corporate Accounts Manager by the beginning of the next fiscal year!”

And so went Anita Strongman, over the dead bodies, past the F-150, and up the corporate ladder.

The End.
