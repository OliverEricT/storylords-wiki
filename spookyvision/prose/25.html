<p>
	The shockwave that exploded from Ryo’s monstrous insectoid form slamming into the massive stoney chitinous body of Mr. Nero was almost as powerful as the shockwaves that emanate from your mama’s gigantic asscheeks when they clap into my balls every night after you get sent to bed with no dessert for trying to sass me at the dinner table, son. I’m your daddy now, just like your mama yells out between claps, and you’re just gonna have to accept that.
</p>
<p>
	Ryo’s extendable arm blade drove deep into the spaces between stony growths on Mr. Nero’s chest, causing the hulking abomination to squeal out in pain, not unlike your mama. The giant’s massive hands tried to wrap around the hard shelled insect carapace that covered what was once Ryo, but had a hard time finding purchase amongst all that alien goo shit that special effects artists make out of KY Jelly. Did you know that’s where that shit comes from? Just imagine all the unfucked dry asses out there because we gotta have a gooey ass creature in our feature. Shameful.
</p>
<p>
	Annnnnnnway,
</p>
<p>
	Kayla S. Hunter scrambled up to her feet as best she could manage as the two freakish horrors slammed around the parking lot, cracking the cement beneath their bodies with each push and pull. Her head was bleeding and she was almost certain she’d cracked a rib or two, but she didn’t have time to think about it then.
</p>
<p>
	She turned her head on a swivel quickly, searching the parking lot for where her “compatriots” in as many quotation marks as she could imagine, had ended up after the monster mash started. Out of the corner of her eye she noted Pavlov Flinch near the front of the building, cowering behind a Pepsi advertisement cardboard cutout of Sylvester Stallone as Cobra. God damn, this gas station really HAD been out of service for a long time…
</p>
<p>
	A moment later she noticed Myrtle Smellie’s still body laying beside the old Ford F-150 parked at the back of the parking lot, a small twitch of the shoulder every so often being the only tell that any life remained in her broken ass undead body. Or at least she hoped some remained.
</p>
<p>
	She took off with a sprint, tucking and rolling underneath the insectoid Ryo’s body being flung through the air and slicing right through the metal of a streetlamp like a hot knife through butter. She pushed back to her feet and kept running, while Ryo caught himself with his jagged claws on the asphalt, skidding to an uneasy stop just as the streetlamp crashed to the ground beside him, sending up an explosion of sparks and fire into the air behind him that looked rad as holy fucking shit and made you think “Wow, maybe this would be worth killing and eating my loved ones cause holy shit did that fucking RULE.”
</p>
<p>
	Kayla made up the distance between her and the F-150 pretty quickly for someone half-limping and kneeled down next to Myrtle, placing a hand on her shoulder and shaking her. The younger woman’s body was limp and cold, but honestly it usually was? So it was actually pretty frustrating to figure out if she was dead or not. Myrtle had used this to her advantage to play dead when asked to do even the most simple of tasks as a teacher’s aide in the past.
</p>
<p>
	“Come on…! Come on…! We have to get the fuck out of here!” Kayla whispered hoarsely, shaking the unresponsive Myrtle violently at this point.
</p>
<p>
	“And where exactly will you be going?” a familiar voice hissed out from behind them. Kayla turned to look over her shoulder, the sneering thick features of Mr. Cornwallis staring down at her only a few feet behind. “It’s rude to leave a social gathering without saying goodbye to your host, after all.”
</p>
<p>
	“Back the fuck up before I turn your out of date Redditor fedora sideways and shove it up your piss hole, Cornhole-is.” Kayla responded with a spit.
</p>
<p>
	“...what?” Cornwallis responded, genuinely taken aback by that threat. He shook the confusion from his mind, “Uh..anyway. I think it’s about time I put an end to you both right now.”
</p>
<p>
	He reached into his jacket pocket and returned with a small snub-nosed revolver, pointing it at Kayla’s head and cocking back the hammer. “Sayonara, Ms. Hunter. I can’t say it’s been a pl–”
</p>
<p>
	Kayla dropped back onto the palms of her hands and swung her leg straight up into Mr. Cornwallis’ crotch, the crunching popping sound of the strike of her heavy leather boots smashing his testicles into an oblivion no man should suffer echoing off the trees that surrounded the gas station. He immediately doubled over, dropping the revolver onto the ground and laying on his side, both of his hands cupping his battered, broken genitals as he wailed out in pain.
</p>
<p>
	Kayla quickly scooped up the revolver and tucked it into the inside pocket of her leather jacket. “You won’t be needing this in the E.R.” she said with a smirk and a flourish, leaning down to pick up the lifeless corpse of Myrtle Smellie, which was - again - how she always was so she had no clue whether she was actually dead or not yet, and tossed her over her shoulder.
</p>
<p>
	“Y-you… fucking… bitch…!” Cornwallis snarled out, his body convulsing and his voice deepening and darkening with each word. Clawed hands with wiry, disgusting fur exploded out of his forearms, sending flesh, bone, and blood splattering across the asphalt below him. His head elongated to the point it could no longer retain itself then burst like an over-ripe watermelon, sending it’s red fleshy contents raining in every direction - leaving behind a gaping maw of jagged, razor-sharp teeth with extended far beyond where was comfortable to look upon. From his back jutted one after another after another long, thin, jagged spikes, which intertwined and created spines which dripped with blood, viscera and a strange purple-black liquid which smoldered and fumed. The histrixidine abomination left in his place drew its head back and screamed into the sky, filling every ear-drum for a mile around.
</p>
<p>
	Thankfully by this time Kayla had jumped into the F-150, hot-wired it started, and was now peeling the fuck out with Myrtle in the seat slumped over beside her. She bore the truck down upon what was once Mr. Cornwallis but the quilled horror leapt twenty feet into the air over it and landed on the ground behind as if it had never left. It turned it’s beady little black eyes back and hissed after it.
</p>
<p>
	“You cannot run, Professor Hunter! There is nowhere on this planet that the Umbralborn cannot see! Cannot reach!”
</p>
<p>
	The wheels of the truck skidded and sputtered in old age as she swung it around the side of the building, barely missing the massive form of Mr. Nero as he repeatedly slammed Ryo’s elongated cricket’s head into the ground over and over, sending spatters of purplish blood flying into the air with each and every strike.
</p>
<p>
	She spun out into the field next to the station, sending bushes and small trees flying as the truck smashed through them, clearing a path in a wide arc back towards the parking lot. The brush parted just quickly enough for Kayla not to have the second she needed to swerve out of the way and the truck obliterated an old rickety wooden outhouse that sat in the middle of the field - sending wood and debris flying like the remnants of a bottle rocket from the impact. From the ground came a bubbling geyser of crude afterward but nothing that Jed Clampett was gonna get his family to Beverly Hills on - it was puuuuure piss and shit. Thankfully it barely even got on the tires.
</p>
<p>
	Back in the parking lot, Kayla brought the truck to a sudden halt and leaned over Myrtle’s body to push the door open at the other side, screaming over the cacophony at Pavlov Flinch who was still safely tucked away in cardboard Stallone’s bosom for protection. “GET THE FUCK IN THE TRUCK! NOW!!”
</p>
<p>
	Flinch stared with wide eyes, not moving. “No thanks!” he called out, ducking slightly more behind Cobra. “You smell like my aunt’s nursing home on Taco Tuesday TEE EMM”
</p>
<p>
	“God damnit!” Kayla screamed, reaching into her jacket to retrieve the snub-nosed revolver and pointing it at Flinch. “GET. THE FUCK. IN.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh uh… of course.” Flinch said, on the verge of shitting himself at this point and adding to the stink. He threw the cardboard cutout of Stallone onto the ground and climbed up into the passenger seat at once, slamming the door shut behind him.
</p>
<p>
	“For fuck’s sake…” Kayla put pedal to metal and peeled the fuck out once more, crossing the parking lot in seconds and yanking the car back onto the road.
</p>
<p>
	“Not that I mind but we’re just leaving him…?” Flinch pointed back toward Ryo, who was now lifting the goliath body of Mr. Nero into the air above his head and walking across the parking lot with it. The chitinous stone body hanging somewhat limp over his hands.
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t know that dude and neither do you! He looks like he’s got the situation under control to me!” Kayla said, not even looking back.
</p>
<p>
	“You didn’t even look!” Flinch said with an incredible amount of upset little brother energy.
</p>
<p>
	Almost in the same instant he finished his sentence, a deafening thud rang out in both her and Flinch’s ears, the top of the truck cab caving in a little on top of them and pressing down onto the tops of their heads only slightly. “FUCK!” both yelled at the same moment.
</p>
<p>
	“Pull over… now!” Mr. Cornwallis screamed with inhuman fervor from the top of their truck, his recurved claws digging into the steel as he rode astride it.
</p>
<p>
	—-------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	Ryo walked slowly but steadily over to the edge of the parking lot, hearing the squealing tires of the truck peeling out as his new compatriots exited the situation. His fingertips dug deep into the now-exposed flesh of Mr. Nero, having ripped away his armored plates with his bare hands during their skirmish. A few steps was all it took to bring him to the jagged, sharp remains of the lamp post he had been thrown through earlier, jutting up out of the ground haphazardly from it’s damage. He drew Nero up above his head and slammed him down onto the pike - the steel piercing up through his back ,into his heart, and out the front of him, causing the hulking monstrosity to let out a blood-curdling scream of pain… then fall silent.
</p>
<p>
	Ryo threw his head up to the sky and screeched from somewhere deep within his carapace body, the blade within his arm piercing out of his flesh into open air once more, dripping blood and muscle tissue onto the ground. With a guillotine’s precision he swiped his blade down through the air and severed the huge corpse’s head off, allowing it to fall to the pavement with a sickening splorch.
</p>
<p>
	He then drove his hand into the midsection he had torn open before and began to drag the entrails out from within, stuffing them deep into his open chittering mandibles - piercing them with serrated jaws beneath - each bite popping part of them like a sausage as they slid down his gullet.
</p>
<p>
	But his bloody reverie was cut short by the sounds of skidding tires and screaming voices, his head snapping in the direction his traveling companions had escaped in.
</p>
<p>
	—---------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	The city of Whitesville wasn’t just quiet - it was absolutely silent. No people spoke, no birds chirped, no cars puttered along their paths toward work or home - the streets were absolutely abandoned though they were pristine and clean.
</p>
<p>
	But that silence was shattered like mirror glass when Kayla sped into the city square in her borrowed Ford F-150, Pavlov Flinch screaming at the top of his lungs out the window for help, and a massive porcupine creature holding onto the top of the cab and yelling orders no one was listening to.
</p>
<p>
	“Fuck off!” Kayla screamed as she fired a shot from the revolver up through the roof absently as she drove. The bullet piercing into Mr. Cornwallis’ flesh but he paid it absolutely no mind, ripping his fingers deeper through the metal of the cab roof and beginning to peel it back and away from the door.
</p>
<p>
	“Damnit, here Flinch! Make yourself useful for once in your godforsaken life!” Kayla shoved the gun into Flinch’s hands, his wide eyes looking down at it then looking back up to Kayla pleadingly. “SHOOT IT AT THE MONSTER, FLINCH!” she screamed in return.
</p>
<p>
	“Fine! It’s just like Call of Duty…” Flinch murmured to himself, pointing the gun up at the cieling and squeezing off two shots into the air. The first one whinged Cornwallis in his wiry-haired shoulder but again did nothing to dissuade him from continuing to rip the truck apart. The second one fired right through the windshield and splintered it like a spiderweb, causing Kayla to immediately start sweving out of control.
</p>
<p>
	“FUUUUUUCCCKKK!!” she screamed, pulling the wheel back and forth to try and right them, the truck driving completely blind over a series of hedges and then slamming grill-first into a statue of some old white fucker in the middle of town, coming to a dead stop on impact.
</p>
<p>
	Cornwallis was flung through the air and landed on his elongated hands and feet at the far corner of the street.
</p>
<p>
	Flinch held his head as he sat back up, the entire world spinning in his view. “Or maybe… it was Medal of Honor controls…? I think the up and down is inverted…”
</p>
<p>
	Kayla laid her head back against the headrest, having not sustained another grievous head wound at least, and let out a long, ragged sigh. “God I hate you Flinch.”
</p>
<p>
	She pushed the door open, the hinges giving out and just dropping the entire thing onto the ground beside her. Flinch for his part just crawled out the window and fell onto his ass on the other side. Kayla quickly surveyed where Mr. Cornwallis had landed and found… nothing. The entire street was completely empty - seemingly abandoned besides the cleanliness and upkeep of everything she hadn’t driven a truck into. “The hell did he go…?”
</p>
<p>
	“Who gives a shit? Let’s steal another car and hit up Atlantic City. Papa needs a new Hatsune Miku bodypillow!” Flinch said with renewed vigor - or at least as much as he could ever possibly have.
</p>
<p>
	Kayla had used the opportunity of ignoring whatever Flinch was saying to reach back into the wrecked truck and retrieve Myrtle’s dead(?) body, heaving it over her shoulder again. “Look I came here for a reason and I’m not leaving until I get some answers. Let’s start with where the hell Cornwallis has snuck off to hide and ambush us later.”
</p>
<p>
	“I noticed none of that means -I- need to be here so…” Flinch responded, but was immediately silenced after as the bank across the street’s front windows came exploding outward in a million pieces, scattering across the road between them and it.
</p>
<p>
	Ryo was laying in the middle of the glass, his slimy green body leaking purple ooze from dozens of lacerations of wounds. Cornwallis stared from within the bank, holding a bloody stump where his right arm used to be, his ragged, hairy form heaving in and out from itself in loud, gasping breaths.
</p>
<p>
	“I’ll… I’ll kill you all! The Umbralborn will live…! Our glorious rebirth will be tonight…!” Cornwallis screamed in an unhinged double-voice - part human and part beast. Ryo slowly sat back up, heaving up a mass of purple and black ooze onto the street before pushing himself back up to his feet.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh fuck me!” Flinch yelled, fumbling around with the revolver in his hands like a kid trying to catch a ball that was thrown at them too fast before finally gripping it correctly and pointing it at Cornwallis.
</p>
<p>
	But the porcupine beast was launching itself forward before anything more could happen, his gaping too-wide mouth spewing blood in every direction as he went in for the kill on his weakened insect prey.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s… it’s just like… SPLATOON!” Flinch yelled, squeezing the trigger and gritting teeth as the shot went off, eyes closed. Through some miracle of divine intervention, the bullet lodged itself directly into the incoming Cornwallis’ eye socket, sending the eye viscera within splaying out into the air and dropping the beast onto the ground from the impact.
</p>
<p>
	Kayla stared in awe at the sight of Flinch actually accomplishing something, absolutely dumbstruck.
</p>
<p>
	As Cornwallis flopped against the ground and began flailing violently, Ryo drew his bladed arm up into the air once more and brought it’s flashing edge down against the center of Cornwallis’ head, splitting it in twain lengthwise and causing the front of his monstrous face to simply fall off onto the ground, blood spewing forth from the wound like a geyser.
</p>
<p>
	The beast, or what was left of it, fell silent and still upon the ground, and Ryo threw his head back to screech at the sky once more, his fists clenched at his sides. But by the time the screech had ended it had metamorphized back into the scream of a horrified man, and Ryo had collapsed face-first onto the street, exhausted and human once more - covered not in a shred of clothing but only in unspeakable gore.
</p>
<p>
	A silent moment passed there in the street then, Kayla and Flinch both standing transfixed at the repugnance that had unfolded before their eyes.
</p>
<p>
	Before it was shattered by Myrtle Smellie shooting up off of Kayla’s shoulder all at once with a ragged inward breath that shocked all unlife back into her, startling the holy fuck out of Kayla. Myrtle shot her eyes at Flinch all at once and immediately blurted out, “SPLATOON?! The kids paint game on the Wii U?!”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s also on Switch…!” Flinch yelled back obstinately.
</p>
<p>
	—------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	The group had slipped inside a house on mainstreet for cover, knowing other terrors awaited them out there somewhere in Whitesville. They had cleaned up as best they could, using what they could find inside the house, and had even found a first aid kit to patch themselves up a little.
</p>
<p>
	Myrtle needed a new neck brace and Kayla had managed to cobble one together out of some gauze wraps, a bathroom towel, and some popsicle sticks they had found. Myrtle wasn’t psyched about how much the sticks poked into her cheeks and collar bone, but it beat your head rolling around like Fred Flinstone’s bowling ball all the time, she supposed.
</p>
<p>
	Kayla and Flinch both needed some pain reliever spray and some bandages, but nothing too incredibly serious. Kayla probably could’ve used some more time and care but she was too focused on what their next step should be in town.
</p>
<p>
	Ryo needed new clothes, again, and was relegated to wearing a far-too-large leisure suit they had found in the back of the closet upstairs as every other scrap of clothing in the building was some kind of moo-moo or night gown. They supposed some old lady lived here before. Even with the threat of being eaten alive by a mantis man, the rest of the group found time to roast him about his new John Travolta ass Saturday Night Fever ass chick repellent suit. He just stared off into the middle distance shell-shocked the entire time anyway so they might as well.
</p>
<p>
	“Alright, enough.” Kayla finally said, standing up in the middle of the plastic-covered grandma living room. “We’ve ragged on Stayin Alive over here, enough. We need to figure out the gameplan now for stopping this ritual this time. It’s almost 11pm. If I know anything about rituals then it’s gonna be going down at midnight.”
</p>
<p>
	“...do you know anything about rituals?” Flinch asked after a silent moment. “That’s pretty niche information, are you like an enthusiast or…?”
</p>
<p>
	“Have you not been paying attention for the last 24 hours, you 50 year old Nintenkid?” Myrtle groaned out, rubbing the bridge of her nose very much like Kayla did when dealing with Flinch. …or with Myrtle. “We’re here to STOP a cult from doing an evil ritual and destroying the world or whatever!”
</p>
<p>
	“We already did that!” Flinch bemoaned, “Is the writer of this story really using the same exact plot for his big finale story as he did for like episode 12 or something of this podcast? That’s genuinely some of the laziest writing I’ve ever heard in my entire life. Even Stephanie Meyer never did that.”
</p>
<p>
	“We gotta do what we gotta do. “Kayla said with a shrug.
</p>
<p>
	The conversation stopped dead in that moment as a polite knock came at the front door. Kayla, Flinch, Ryo, and Myrtle all froze in place, turning their eyes toward the sound. They exchanged glances back and forth and none moved from their place, sitting in the silence that followed. Knock, knock, knock - just as polite as the first.
</p>
<p>
	Kayla held her hand out to Flinch and shook it in place, causing Flinch to sleepily look down at the pistol sitting on his lap. He looked back at her with empty, thoughtless eyes. She pointed, hard, at the pistol and then held her hand out again, much more forcefully. His eyes widened and he picked the gun up and sat it in her palm, giving an incredibly proud-of-himself look that caused everyone else in the room to sigh. The knock repeated itself.
</p>
<p>
	Kayla gripped the gun and held it behind her back, sidling up to the front door. She slowly turned the knob and slid the door open without saying a word.
</p>
<p>
	“Thank you, I was under the impression I would be standing outside forever at this rate.” a familiar voice floated around the edge of the door, and Kayla swung it the entire way open after.
</p>
<p>
	Standing in the doorway was a tall man, with black slicked back hair, a suit and peacoat in all black, the collar turned up, and a pair of bright red circular sunglasses resting upon his pallid features. Standing in the doorway was none other than Indrid Cold.
</p>
<p>
	Everyone in the room suddenly felt a buzzing in their head - like the distant patter of bees around their nest, and an unmistakable floaty, empty-headed feeling that none of them could identify. An extremely familiar feeling for Kayla S. Hunter.
</p>
<p>
	She took three steps back from the door and propped herself up against the bar at the other side of the room with one hand. “Cold…? What the hell are you doing here? Did you… did you set up that fake you to lure us here? What’s going on?”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m afraid I wasn’t aware that you and your compatriots had arrived in Whitesville, Ms. Hunter.” Cold said with a smile crossing his features that was just slightly too wide, just slightly too many teeth showing behind his thin lips. “I arrived upon receiving the news. I imagine you were brought here to stop the ritual that occurs at midnight.”
</p>
<p>
	Kayla gave a rueful glare to Flinch when the midnight time of the ritual was confirmed. Flinch just shrugged in return.
</p>
<p>
	“I believe if you wish to complete your ill-gotten mission then you’ll need to interfere with the Acolyte’s where they all now congregate. The observatory up on the hill, just past Adams Avenue and 6th. It shouldn’t take but fifteen minutes to arrive.” Cold said, his twisting smile never leaving his lips. The group was having trouble concentrating for some reason, though his words seemed to pierce through the fog well enough for recollection.
</p>
<p>
	“Can you… can you help us?” Myrtle said, holding her head with her hand. She had never felt this way before - like she was talking in a very vivid dream to someone she could barely comprehend at that moment but she had exact knowledge of just the same.
</p>
<p>
	“I always help. In my own way. That’s what The Silverblood Society does - and my employer will always be there.” He returned. “You had better move out. Time grows increasingly short.”
</p>
<p>
	Kayla, Flinch, and Myrtle all slowly headed toward the front door, Cold waving his hand to usher them past graciously. As Ryo stood up to follow, Cold simply turned his head to look at him and stopped him in his tracks.
</p>
<p>
	Ryo felt heavy as he stood there in place. He had remembered in that moment a dream he had when he was younger - a recurring dream that had always left him in a cold sweat when awakened. He was being followed by a black shape, indistinguishable and violent, that grew ever-larger and moved every closer, buzzing and humming with malice. He tried to run, but his feet felt stuck to the ground, like trying to run through a swamp, like being stuck like a fly in molasses. Like trapped quarry.
</p>
<p>
	Cold shut the door behind Kayla, Flinch, and Myrtle as they left, assuring them “Your companion will be along shortly.”
</p>
<p>
	“Why… why can’t I go with them now?” Ryo said, fear slightly raising in his voice as his mind replayed his nightmares over and over at its deepest point.
</p>
<p>
	“Why my dear boy… your part in all of this is over. You are no longer useful to humanity.” Cold said matter-of-factly, crossing across the living room to make up the distance between them.
</p>
<p>
	“I can be… I am… human… aren’t I?” Ryo whispered, his voice hoarse, his cheeks suddenly hot and wet though he could not figure out why.
</p>
<p>
	There was an instant flash of silver, and before any measure could be taken, a shining longsword was pierced directly through Ryo’s midsection. The seering white-hot pain that encroached upon his every thought burning away his consciousness just as the sword’s touch began to burn away at his flesh, his muscles, his bones, tearing away at the fabric that held them together and roasting him alive until nothing was left.
</p>
<p>
	The ashes of what was once Ryo Tachibana fell to the floor in a heap at his feet, and Indid Cold stared down at them without a hint of emotion upon his mask-like face.
</p>
<p>
	“No, Mr. Tachibana. I’m afraid you are not.”
</p>
<p>
	TO BE CONTINUED
</p>
