</p>
<p>
	Sweat trickled down Jason Grace’s twisted, anguished face. His eyes shook in their sockets as he stared unblinkingly, watching the sweat droplet fall from his brow, and instantly be snapped up and devoured by a ravenous snake less than a foot from his face. It hissed as it coiled back down to the ground, into the swirling, shapeless mass of hundreds of thousands of snakes that stretched as far as the eye could see in every direction below him.
</p>
<p>
	He was dangling by a further fraying knot of rope tied around his ankles, each minute movement of his body causing the thread to untangle further and his body to sink every lower in the sea of starving serpents which waited impatiently for their screaming, wriggling meal to be delivered to them. They slithered and coiled wetly around one another, hissing and baring their dripping, venomous fangs up at Jason the closer he came to falling.
</p>
<p>
	He wanted to call for help, to pray to a god he didn’t believe in, any god, to save him - to deliver him from this living hell, but no words could escape his chapped lips. He knew that any extra movement would snap the rope, and it would all be over.
</p>
<p>
	But it was yet still inevitable that that fate would come to pass. And hours, maybe days passed as he dared not scream and yet internally could not cease it. A never-ending twilight of horror which only ceased the instant the rope snapped and he fell into the pulsating abyss of his own violent, final feast.
</p>
<p>
	“AGGGHHHHH!!” Jason screamed as he lunged back into reality, pulling with all of his might against the strange futuristic metal restraints that held him aloft in place in the middle of the dark interrogation chamber he’d been in for hours at this point. His head drooped and his muscles strained with ache and pain as he gave in to reality once more. He was still trapped.
</p>
<p>
	“Awww, poor baby.” the same sultry voice broke the deep silence afterward that had been filling his ears the entire time. The strange woman stepped from the darkness and smiled her toothy, mirthless smile at him and it tore into his psyche like blades, just like every time before. “You could make all this end in a second. All you have to do is tell me where that disgusting little private detective has scummed off to and I’ll put you out of your misery.”
</p>
<p>
	The woman flung her braided white-blonde hair back over her shoulder and giggled to herself as Jason remained quiet.
</p>
<p>
	“You know, it’s a lot more fun when you beg for mercy. Don’t worry, it’s not a sexual thing for me at all. JUST KIDDING! It gets me creaming like a dairy farm EVERY time, darling.” she yelled out excitedly.
</p>
<p>
	“Suck a fuck you rancid moth gunt.” Jason spat out, glaring out of the top of his bloodshot eyes at her with his head down.
</p>
<p>
	“Jesus.” she returned, bewildered.
</p>
<p>
	“You said you wanted begging? Then strap yourself in, sister!” Dev interrupted, dangling from the same mechanical restraints less than a foot to the left of Jason, his own psyche looking pretty damn ravaged from unspeakable hallucination. “PLLLLEEASSEE LET ME GO, I’LL DO ANYTHING, MY DAD’S A FOOTBALL GUY OF SOME SORT, HE COULD–”
</p>
<p>
	The woman placed a hand over Dev’s mouth. “Please never speak. Just like… ever. Your voice is like an enema sponsored by Epsom Salt and Knives.”
</p>
<p>
	“Uhrite” Dev spoke through her hand, nodding. She removed it, and he instantly continued, “But how am I supposed to get out of here, then? I don’t even know this Schrodinger Wince guy! The whole thing seems PRE-TTY unfair to me!”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s been hours since we pumped the two of you full of every type of truth serum on the market…” the woman continued, ignoring Dev completely and rubbing at the bridge of her nose. “How haven’t either of you spilled your beans yet?”
</p>
<p>
	“I almost did when we first got here but luckily I went before the convention.” Dev said, incredibly honestly.
</p>
<p>
	“God DAMN you disgust me.” Jason said just as honestly, leering over at Dev with disgust in his eyes. “I can’t even fucking fathom why I want to be friends with you, but here we fucking are.”
</p>
<p>
	“Aw, you wanna be friends too?! I think you’re like a cool action hero type and I’m gonna be your sidekick!” Dev said happily, leaning as far as his shackles would allow toward Jason, “ Being a sidekick doesn’t even affect my self-respect or ego cause I barely have either after a lifetime of bullying and parental neglect!”
</p>
<p>
	“I fucking hate that we have the parental neglect thing in common, god damnit! My dad thinks I’m a disappointment because I didn’t stick with baseball in high school and I’m gay, but mostly the baseball thing for some fucking reason?” Jason puzzled out, tilting his head a bit.
</p>
<p>
	“My dad’s the same way with football! Like, I’m 98 pounds soaking wet and you want me to play WHICH position on this team of pubescent behemoths? What am I gonna do bite their ankles when they–”
</p>
<p>
	“ENOUGH!! God DAMNIT enough!” the woman captor screamed out, slamming her fist down on the table just beyond the edge of the light. “What is going ON here? This isn’t Dr. fucking Phil. It’s an evil secret torture chamber! Do I need to start physically torturing the two of you to get you to tell me ONE thing I need?”
</p>
<p>
	“Part of me would really like that.” Dev whispered. “Sexually, I mean.”
</p>
<p>
	“I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT!” the woman screamed. 
</p>
<p>
	She threw both hands up in the air and paused, breathing in deeply with her eyes shut for a moment. When she released the breath and opened her eyes, she spoke again, “Look. You two don’t know this, but I’m one of the Four Heavenly Emperors of Evolution - the highest ranked, most evolved Chrysalids in the entirety of the organization. I could have your entire families killed with a snap of my fingers and no one would ever find out. Hell, I could have YOU be seen as the culprits if I wanted! IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?!”
</p>
<p>
	(H) “Damn, Miller… you’ve really lost control of this entire situation, haven’t you?” a voice from the darkness shocked the woman, apparently named Miller, from her rage induced tantrum.
</p>
<p>
	All eyes in the room turned as two figures slowly walked from the darkness surrounding the lit circle at the center of the room everyone had been illuminated by until now. Two men, one large and imposing, and the other slippery and even-keeled.
</p>
<p>
	“Who the hell invited the big bussy boys?” Miller spat out, rolling her eyes.
</p>
<p>
	“Bussy?” the larger man said, scratching his thick fingers through the tightly cropped blonde crewcut atop his head. He stood close to seven feet tall and wore a military uniform with all of the identifying regalia either ripped partially off or partially marked out with what looked like caked on blood. His deep-set dull gray eyes rolled from one side of their sockets to the other as he pondered over the word. “What’s a bussy? Like a boy pussy?”
</p>
<p>
	“Got it in one.” the shorter man slithered out from between his teeth. He was tall, but naturally so, and extremely thin for a man his size. He wore an ostentatious snakeskin jacket with emblems webbed into the skin and fabric and a pair of snakeskin boots to match, dressed in a loose black suit without a tie otherwise. A greased pompadour with a streak of green dyed through it and a pair of sunglasses resting on his nose completed his look, whatever the fuck it was. Literal lounge lizard, I guess. “Howdy, prisoners. Got any juicy goss for us?”
</p>
<p>
	“YOU?!” Jason lunged against his restraints at the shorter of the two men, his teeth gnashed together in rage. He struggled against his restraints with such violent hateful energy that even Dev leaned away from him at this point. “You’re the snake fucker from last week! The one who fought the bug guy and killed the old man across town!”
</p>
<p>
	“Damn, partner, that’s a good memory you got there. I’d ask you to be more specific for me, but I s’pose you probably only seen me do that shit once, so.” The man we know as Snake said nonchalantly, shrugging as he did.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh BIG WHOOP!” Dev interrupted angrily, “You got an arch enemy! I got an arch enemy too! That other dude is Commander Hawk, he’s the guy who tried to recruit me to join Gestalt and then like… chased some big cowboy away? To be honest with you, I don’t really remember that story very well - that memory, I mean. Memory.”
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t remember this kid at all.” Hawk said with a shake of his head and a jerk of his thumb towards him over his shoulder. Dev crumpled, dangling from his shackles in shame.
</p>
<p>
	“COMMANDER Hawk?” Miller laughed loudly, even inciting a chuckle from Snake. “You don’t have a RANK in Gestalt, you fucking larper! We all have one name after we’re reborn. Your name is Hawk, period. Like Beyonce.”
</p>
<p>
	“BEYONCE’S LAST NAME IS KNOWLES, YOU FUCKING FOOL!” Hawk cried out, lunging toward Miller with his hands outstretched for her throat. Snake grabbed him under his arms though and held him back to the best of his abilities as the larger man flailed towards her and she just stood there laughing in his face.
</p>
<p>
	Jason and Dev exchanged glances.
</p>
<p>
	The three stopped, eventually, and turned their attention back toward their captives.
</p>
<p>
	“You’re lookin’ a sprig less froggy since you ain’t runnin’ your mouth at a lone man anymore, Jason Grace.” Snake said, stepping around in front of the incredibly hung (and also being held captive by restraints) Jason. “No violent threats? No big boasts about how you’re gonna beat my head on somethin’ sturdy this time?”
</p>
<p>
	“You psychopaths just need to tell me where my brother is! That’s all I ever fucking cared about! Fuck your stupid cause, the fucking cheese-smelling ass private dick, EVERYTHING! WHERE IS MY LITTLE BROTHER ARCHIE?!” Jason wailed out in rage, his restraints shaking with his lunges against them.
</p>
<p>
	Miller and Hawk exchanged glances at the force of his movements, both slightly unsure of the manacles holding him in place for a moment. Hawk shook his head to let her know they were fine though.
</p>
<p>
	Snake sneered a vicious, hateful grin. “You wanna see your brother Archie…?”
</p>
<p>
	“He’s here?!” Jason yelled out once more, this time with a lot less bass and fire in his voice and a lot more genuine concern.
</p>
<p>
	“Sort’ve.” Snake hissed. He walked back into the darkness, his entire body being engulfed in it for but a moment, before he returned, pulling behind him a small table with a computer monitor and keyboard on it - the screen flickering to life as he did. “Take a gander here.”
</p>
<p>
	He pressed the enter key on the keyboard with a long, bony finger, causing the CTV screen to whir to life fully. A staticky view of a street in the middle of Whitesville could be seen through it, with a staccato date flittering in the corner - weeks ago, just past sunset. The street was completely empty. 
</p>
<p>
	Jason stared, unblinking at the screen as a long shadow appeared at its edges.
</p>
<p>
	A boy on a bike rode into frame, peddling as fast as he could. Jason’s eyes widened and he pulled against his restrains, straining to get a closer look. The young boy wore the Kirby Middle School baseball uniform and hat, there was no doubt who it was. The relief that washed over Jason in that moment, the relief of finally seeing his brother, alive and well, was short lived.
</p>
<p>
	Bladed fingers ripped Archie from his seat and flung him into the bare concrete. Archie was brave though, and resourceful. He leapt to his feet and swung his baseball bat as hard and as fast as he could. But bravery sometimes isn’t enough. The creature swung back and Archie’s head was severed from his shoulders in one fell swoop of blood and viscera.
</p>
<p>
	Snake pressed the enter key again, pausing the feed. Jason stared, his mouth agape, tears running down his cheeks in his shaking, gutted silence.
</p>
<p>
	“Dead as a doornail, partner.” Snake sneered out, drawing his thumb across his throat violently. “Schwick. No more noggin. Saaaaaad stuff, brother.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh my god… Jason…” Dev whispered, staring unblinking at his new companion with his own jaw dropped. 
</p>
<p>
	Jason’s head dropped, and he hung limp from his restraints, completely silenced. 
</p>
<p>
	“You finally got him to shut the fuck up and stop barking at me like a dog. I feel like I owe you gratitude snake. I feel so unclean.” Miller said, shivering in disgust at the thought.
</p>
<p>
	“How bout that? What you gotta say for yourself now, kiddo? You gon’ beat me up with your dead brother’s little league baseball bat?” Snake laughed a heavy little chuckle, baring all of his sharp teeth.
</p>
<p>
	Jason dangled silently for a moment. Then lunged all of his weight forward at Snake, causing the laughing to stop and his tormentor to take a quick, startled step backwards. Jason’s teeth were clenched tight and his eyes bloodshot red as they poured tears still. 
</p>
<p>
	He growled out his words as much as spoke them, “You motherfuckers just made the worst mistake of your fucking lives! All I wanted was to find my brother and go home but now that that’s not possible anymore…? Now that he’s dead…?”
</p>
<p>
	Miller, Hawk, and Snake stared at him, each of them shocked to silence at his reaction.
</p>
<p>
	“Now that he’s dead…” Jason continued, almost frothing at the mouth. “I’m going to hunt every single one of you Gestalt bastards down, no matter how far you fucking run, to the ends of the fucking Earth and back, and I’m going to kill every. Single. One of you. And for Archie…? I’m going to make it as slow as I possibly fucking can.”
</p>
<p>
	“I…I think I peed a little.” Dev said plainly, his eyes saucer plates staring at his psychotic new pal.
</p>
<p>
	BBRRRREEEEEEEEE!!
</p>
<p>
	An alarm began to sound, loud enough to splinter ear drums normally, let alone after hours and hours of low talk in an interrogation room. Everyone in the room winced from the loud thrumming, but Hawk ran back into the darkness, disappearing into it. Suddenly the overhead lights flashed on in the room, blinding pretty much everybody at once.
</p>
<p>
	“FUCKING HAWK!” Miller screeched out, covering her eyes.
</p>
<p>
	“There’s an intruder alert, dipshit!” Hawk grunted out in return, standing in front of a monitor in the wall and typing on the small keyboard attached to it. 
</p>
<p>
	Now that the light was on, it was obvious the room around them was covered in tables full of technology, classic torture devices, monitors, and various types of racks and spike traps and whatnot, all that kinky ass shit your mama likes but not enough of it. She’s fuckin’ DIRTY, son, holy shit. Anyway, you’re having a baby sister.
</p>
<p>
	Oh yeah, the story.
</p>
<p>
	The three chrysalids stood around the screen on the wall, peering through the staticky footage on it together. Jason and Dev could barely make it out from where they were hanging from but managed to watch as best they could.
</p>
<p>
	On the street outside this building, whatever it happened to be, there stood two twenty-something women in semi-fashionable casual clothing - one holding a duffel bag and the other stealing glances of the one holding a duffel bag over and over and pretending like she wasn’t when caught. They were looking at the building and speaking back and forth to one another about something.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s just two women.” Snake said nonchalantly, shrugging his shoulders. “The hell is the alarm going off for? Just lock the front door, the place just looks like a damn abandoned building.”
</p>
<p>
	“You never read your dossiers, Snake. You never keep up with intel, you’re god damn hopeless.” Hawk barked back, glaring down at Snake. “That’s the Esper girl from Kirby. The one who killed Queen Bee? The one who threw around half a block with her fucking MIND?”
</p>
<p>
	“Sue me for havin’ a social life.” Snake returned, then did a double take, “Queen Bee is dead?! When the hell did that happen?”
</p>
<p>
	“Like a week ago, who cares.” Miller said, typing on the keyboard. There was a loud squelch of static and she withdrew a small round CB radio looking receiver from the side of the keyboard and held it to her mouth, “Dispatch Drones. All of ‘em. YES ALL OF THEM. The Esper is outside and she’s still putting off some kinda supernatural energy source we can’t pinpoint.”
</p>
<p>
	Somewhere inside of the compound there were walls lined with human beings. Each one dangled from a hook, slowly swaying back and forth, their silence aided by the gas masks tied tightly to their faces. Their bodies draped in black and dark blue riot gear. Each one of them had once been a normal person, with a family, friends, a life of their own. So they weren’t cops is what I’m saying, you should feel bad for them for this predicament. 
</p>
<p>
	But with the order from Miller suddenly the hooks automatically began to lower to the ground, each dangling body swaying with the automated motion until the bottoms of their jackboots hit in the ground. The instant after the eyeholes of their gasmasks lit up with horrific purple light for just a moment - causing all of their muscles to seize up and their bodies to jerk to life. The hook yanked from their backs, sending a spray of unnecessary viscera because the practical effects team thought it looked cool, and then rescinded back into the wall. They all turned in unison, and mindlessly began to march down the hallway in lockstep.
</p>
<p>
	—----------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	“Are you sure this is the place you saw on your peeping tom invasion of privacy walkabout, Dips?” Alyssa asked without inflection, tilting her head from side to side as she peered at the dilapidated old wreck of a building in front of them and threw her duffel bag over her shoulder. The building could have been some kind of post office or shop at some point but it was half caved in on itself and covered in moss and debris now.
</p>
<p>
	“Yo, it ain’t peepin’ if there ain’t no ghost laws about it, dude. Or… wait.. There ain’t no law… in ghost land?” Dips scratched at his non-corporeal chin. “There’s nothin’ wrong with lookin’ long as you ain’t cookin’!” he blurted out and then nodded with a grin on his face, satisfied with himself.
</p>
<p>
	“Ew, Dips! Think before you say stuff!” TK scolded, embarrassed that he said that in front of Alyssa more than anything else. She stuffed her hands in her jacket pockets and sunk her neck down below the collar of it, trying to hide from the feeling.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m gonna assume he said some stupid shit and move on.” Alyssa returned, looking down the street distantly to see if she could spot any people. After they had walked down the first few streets of town the people staring at them from their porches had more or less dried up. She couldn’t tell if she thought that was better or worse for them.
</p>
<p>
	“Harsh, bro.” Dips floated back a little, whipping his hand around in the air to create a pair of ghostly sunglasses the same blue-white transparent color as the rest of him and settling them on his face. For some reason they became completely opaque like a real pair of sunglasses once there.
</p>
<p>
	“Did you just make sunglasses?” TK asked, squinting her eyes at Dips. “You can make things now?”
</p>
<p>
	“Yo I can shapeshift my ecoplasm and junk dude, it’s sick. I’m like Alex Mack and whatnot, dawg. I can also pick who gets to see me and who doesn’t, yo, that’s what your girlfriend can’t. Least ways til she gets a lil’ nicer to me, brah.” Dips returned, floating with his hands behind his head in a reclined position.
</p>
<p>
	“You can WHAT?!” TK screamed out.
</p>
<p>
	“Uh… TK?” Alyssa took a step back away from the sidewalk, flinging her duffel bag off of her shoulder, yanking it unzipped and pulling the sawed off shotgun from inside of it before throwing the bag onto the ground haphazardly.
</p>
<p>
	“Wh– you brought the gun for real?!” TK yelled, but was immediately silenced when she looked at what had spooked Alyssa. From every man-sized hole, crack, and crevice in the old dilapidated building in front of them crawled a fucking riot officer or some shit holding a semi-automatic rifle in their hands.
</p>
<p>
	One by one each of them emerged and walked to the edge of the sidewalk, standing stock-still with their rifles at military style present arms. There were at least two dozen of them in total, and each one of them moved with an unnatural stiffness as to seem robotic. Not one of them spoke.
</p>
<p>
	The squelching static of a loud speaker broke the silence deafeningly, causing only TK and Alyssa to cover their ears amongst all these other people.
</p>
<p>
	The static struggled to clear, and within it, a strange voice could be heard in the distance for a moment.
</p>
<p>
	“The… moon… beyond… we are…. coming…”
</p>
<p>
	A loud, whining static ring broke the static, and a woman’s voice broke through more clearly.
</p>
<p>
	“Greetings Teresa Kanzaki and Alyssa Medero! Welcome to DIE!”
</p>
<p>
	TK and Alyssa exchanged glances.
</p>
<p>
	“Drones… contain them.” 
</p>
<p>
	Every drone standing on the busted up old building's lawn suddenly snapped to life and drew their rifles’ butts up to their shoulders, pointing the barrel directly at the two young girls. Alyssa dropped her own shotgun to her side immediately.
</p>
<p>
	“Holy schnikes, dudes!” Dips yelled out.
</p>
<p>
	“Uh… I uh..” TK stuttered, feeling very deeply in her soul that she should have something to say right now as the defacto leader of this little fucked up trio, but finding no words in her dry, scratchy throat and her burning terrified chest.
</p>
<p>
	The voice on the speaker came to life once more, “Heavy arms, to the front!”
</p>
<p>
	The group of drones split directly up the center, revealing a single drone in the back who was kneeling down on the ground. Laying across his shoulder, held up by both arms, was a US military grade bazooka, pointing DIRECTLY at TK and Alyssa.
</p>
<p>
	“OHHHH FUCK!!” TK and Alyssa screamed at once, turning immediately to run as fast as they could.
</p>
<p>
	“I GOT THIS DUUUUDDESS!” Dips began a bolt of white translucent lighting, swirling up into the sky and crashing back down directly into the body of the drone holding the bazooka in his arms. The drone’s body still knelt stock still in place once Dips had disappeared.
</p>
<p>
	TK stopped running and turned back, panting and staring wide eyed, “Wait! Dips possessed the bazooka guy!! We can turn the tide!”
</p>
<p>
	The aforementioned bazooka guy jerked his head to the side for a second, then resettled his eye on the sights of the bazooka, still pointing at them.
</p>
<p>
	“Uh… Dips…?” TK scream-whispered through gritted teeth.
</p>
<p>
	“I uh… I can’t…” Dips’ disembodied voice rang out from seemingly nowhere. “I can’t control this dude!! OH SHIT BRO, HE AIN’T GOT NO MIND NO MORE!”
</p>
<p>
	The voice over the speaker sparked back into life, “Heavy Arms… LIGHT ‘EM UP!”
</p>
<p>
	“NOOO!! TK!” Dips screamed out, trying with every bit of ghostly power he could manage to stop the Drone from pulling the trigger.
</p>
<p>
	But he couldn’t do anything.
</p>
<p>
	The bazooka fired off, its backsplash of burning red hot fire flashing to light just as the rocket within its tube body exploded out of its end.
</p>
<p>
	Alyssa leapt to the ground and threw her hands over her head, wishing more than anything she hadn’t followed the lead of a 90’s snack food mascot ghost to this stupid fucking Resident Evil ass death trap.
</p>
<p>
	Dips flailed and pushed and did everything he possibly could to try to wrest control of the Drone, but there was nothing to wrest control of - there was no thought left to hijack. And it was far too late anyway. All he could do was scream before the explosion would drown him out for even TK, his only friend in almost 30 years of wandering.
</p>
<p>
	But there was no explosion.
</p>
<p>
	Alyssa opened her tightly closed eyes and threw her head back to see what had happened to TK. Dips stared as well, with wide eyes stinging with tears for the first time since his death.
</p>
<p>
	The rocket shuttered violently back and forth in the air, every molecule of it’s being, every facet of its construction, trying to propel itself forward, but incapable of movement - locked in space and shaking for destruction.
</p>
<p>
	TK stood in the middle of the street, her hair flowing around her like the tendrils of an old gold, her eyes an inky black to match, and the color-tinged winds of her power cycling around her like a fuckin’ Super Saiyan it was tight as fucking SHIT dude. She hadn’t even raised her hand to stop the rocket, she just stood glaring at it, arms at her side, and it shivering in its confines only inches from her face.
</p>
<p>
	“The Esper has activated!!” the voice on the speaker screamed.
</p>
<p>
	But before she could scream an order for her mindless drones, TK flashed her whiteless eyes across the street toward the Drones who stood lined up with their rifles pointed at her. The rocket in front of her, violently shaking as it tried to break her bonds, began to slowly, methodically, rotate in space over itself, until it’s explosive tip was pointed back at the gathered crowd of minions.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh… oh shit…” Alyssa muttered under her breath before scratching and fumbling back to her feet and beginning to run as fast as she could across the street away from what was about to happen.
</p>
<p>
	She had made it behind the house across the lane by the time TK released the missile from her unseen grasp, and allowed it to finally make its final destination - directly into the dilapidated building just behind the drones.
</p>
<p>
	To say the explosion was larger than you would imagine is an understatement. The old building had been rigged for explosion at some point or something cause that shit went up like The Fourth of July at my inbred hillbilly ass cousin’s house the weekend after he finally made bail money. The bright white light was blinding and encompassed half the block on either side of the street.
</p>
<p>
	When the blast had subsided there was a deep, eerie, shellshocked quietness. The bodies of the drones had been completely decimated, leaving nothing but blood stains on the ground behind in their wake. Dips was floating exactly where the bazooka drone had been knelt, his entire body stiff and eyes wide in a complete and unbridled level of shock he had never felt in his entire life. A massive smear of viscera behind him showed him exactly where his possess-ee had gone. 
</p>
<p>
	Alyssa slowly but surely began to push herself up to her feet, and looked behind her where she had been kneeling behind the house across the street. Except of course, there was no house across the street anymore, not in any way that really mattered. Splintered wood lay everywhere amongst concrete and indiscernible metal chunks. She was alive only because there was a thin, human-sized strip of the house - from front to back where she stood - still in tact. The exact bit of the house that lined up perfectly to be right behind where TK floated across the street.
</p>
<p>
	TK’s power had blocked the explosion from harming her at all. She still floated about an inch off the ground in place, her hair swirling in the unseen energies she evoked. Her body had blocked the path of the explosion perfectly in order to ensure that Alyssa had survived.
</p>
<p>
	But a few seconds after that, her eyes drained of their void and she very quickly slumped over, falling onto the hard concrete of the road hard.
</p>
<p>
	“TK!!” Alyssa screamed, running across the road and dropping down next to her, wrapping her up in her arms. “TK, are you ok?! TK say something please, holy shit, TK!”
</p>
<p>
	She turned her head up into the air, and screamed into no direction specifically, “DIPS!! DIPS!!”
</p>
<p>
	The ghostly teenager appeared out of the nothingness next to her in a way that would’ve probably made her poop pants at any other point, but she immediately began to hold TK out to her. “You gotta do something! Is she dying? What happened?!”
</p>
<p>
	“Yo she’s just out cold, bro, it’s cool! She’ll be fine but we absolutely GOTTA get her outta here, dude! Who knows when that voiceover witch will pop up and Horny Toad us all, bro!” Dips said frantically.
</p>
<p>
	“What?!” Alyssa yelled with exasperation in her voice.
</p>
<p>
	—---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	The explosion had rattled the subterranean complex below the dilapidated old building pretty damn badly. Everything that could have fallen, had fallen, and it had thrown around everyone who wasn’t attached to a big horrific torture machine of some kind pretty good.
</p>
<p>
	When they had righted themselves, Hawk was the one who broke the silence.

<p>
	“God DAMN that was fuckin’ crazy!” he screamed out, pointing at the flashing static on the monitor screen they had been staring at.
</p>
<p>
	“Move, imbecile!” Miller screeched, shoving Hawk to the side as best she could. She began to type frantically on the keyboard. The screen flashed a few times then switched to a camera somewhere more distant. She zoomed in three or four times before they could all clearly see the two girls sitting in the middle of the street, the other one cradling Teresa Kanzaki in her arms.
</p>
<p>
	“How in the hell is this girl capable of such power? Espers are spoon benders at best usually.” Snake said without conviction, his mind elsewhere at that moment for some reason.
</p>
<p>
	“How in the fuck should I know, Boot Scoot n’ Boogie? She killed Queen Bee, we knew she was powerful. I can’t believe I sent the drones out!” Miller hissed from gritted teeth.
</p>
<p>
	“That was all we have at this outpost as well. It would take hours for Drones to make it here from Arklay.” Hawk returned.
</p>
<p>
	“We’re going to have to kill her ourselves. If all three of the remaining Four Emperors attack her at once - especially why she’s weakened like this - we can just wipe her out and be done with it. “Miller said expositionally while walking toward the doors on the other side of the room. She paused before opening it and looked back at Jason and Dev. “We won’t be long, dears. Stay put for mommy.”
</p>
<p>
	And Miller and Hawk went through the door, disappearing on the other side.
</p>
<p>
	Snake walked to behind where Jason and Dev could see for a moment before leaving. He returned holding Jason’s axe in his hand and shoved it up to Jason’s neck violently. “I oughta keelhaul you with your own fuckin’ axe and leave you for the fuckin’ birds, kid. You can’t threaten a man and walk away from it.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m not doing much walking right now, fuckface.” Jason spat out, again growling more than speaking.
</p>
<p>
	But something about the ax had captured Snake’s attention instead. He peered at it with raised eyebrows and then began to chuckle, “Now how did a little shitstain like you end up with a Silverblood Society weapon? This little number’ll burn away anything that ain’t considered natural by you flatscan fools. You’re a little too human to be a member - you steal it off a corpse somewhere, junior?”
</p>
<p>
	The wall speaker squealed to life, and Miller’s voice sparked through, “SNAKE! GET THE FUCK UP HERE! You’re not gonna shirk your duty on this one, limp dick!”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m comin’!” Snake yelled out at no one who could hear. He turned back to Jason and grinned, tossing the ax onto the floor. “You sit pretty, partner. I’m gonna have a lot of fun peeling your skin off and makin’ my new boots…”
</p>
<p>
	And with that, Snake also disappeared outside the doors.
</p>
<p>
	“I never thought they’d leave!” Dev said after a few moments, rubbing his wrists and cracking his back. Wait… what? He stood in the middle of the room, upright and completely free from captivity?! TWIST!
</p>
<p>
	“What the fuck?! You’re out of your shackles!” Jason screamed out, then immediately thought better and lowered his voice to a whisper. “What the fuuuucckk?”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh yeah I installed a virus I keep in my calculator watch into their security systems the second we got here!” Dev beamed, “I just couldn’t release my shackles until there wasn’t as high of a chance of someone beating me up instantaneously and violently!”
</p>
<p>
	Jason noted he didn’t say it was a zero percent chance since he was still here. “God DAMN that’s improbable as fuck! Forget it though Dev, you’re a fucking miracle worker! Now get me down from here, we gotta get the fuck out of this place!”
</p>
<p>
	“Easy squeazy, big cheesy!” Dev said, beamingly. He tapped a few buttons on his calculator watch, which caused the manacles around Jason’s hands and legs to drop him to the floor instantly. 
</p>
<p>
	Jason drew himself back up to his full height and rotated his shoulder around a few times. “Alright…” he reached down to the floor and picked up his silver-tipped ax, looking over it from one side to the other with a newfound curiosity for its origins. “We’ve got some serious work to do now.”
</p>
<p>
	“Wh…what? We’re not just running?” Dev asked with a little shake to his voice.”I did mention I already peed a little, right?”
</p>
<p>
	“We’re staying.” Jason returned, walking over to the monitor on the wall, which still showed an image of Aylssa rocking TK back and forth in the street and talking to seemingly no one. Jason paced his finger on the screen next to them. “We’re meeting up with them. We’re not leaving them to get killed in her sleep by these Gestalt pieces of shit. Fuck that.”
</p>
<p>
	He then walked over to the other side of the room, and knelt down next to the CTV which had fallen from its table perch on the ground. The frame that Snake had paused on was flickering on its black and white screen. A horrific insectoid monster stood in the middle of the street, raising its massive bladed arms to the sky.
</p>
<p>
	Jason placed his finger next to the insectoid monster, and gritted his teeth, “Then we’re going to find him. I know exactly who this fucking grasshopper fucker really is and I’m going to dissect him for science class a hundred fucking times over.”
</p>
<p>

<p>
	Elsewhere in Whitesville Connecticut, the wind blows harshly from across the empty town. It ruffles the dark black wavy hair of the man who walks alone down the middle of the street, hands in his black overcoat pockets as its tails are splayed through the air behind him. 
</p>
<p>
	The man’s eyes are steel and hate as he walks towards his destination. His prey will lead him to the bigger fish to fry. Gestalt will pay for what they had done to him.
</p>
<p>
	Ryo Tachibana will finally have his revenge.
