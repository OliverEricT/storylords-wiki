Office Job Massacre 2: The Long and Winding Choad aka Jeff Couldn’t Think of a Title - part 1 of 6 (guest starring Weena Mercatur as the Hopping Woman)

Prompts: Cowboys & Fungus

By Jeff Pennington


Dev struggled a bit as he pushed the garage door open, squinting his eyes as the early morning light streamed inside. The birds sang the harmony of dawn and the distant sounds of cars starting up for their early commute played second chair alongside them.


Dev pushed his oversized coke-bottle glasses up the bridge of his nose, ran a hand over his messy high-top fade, and turned around to survey his life’s work up until this point. 


A small sign hung outside the garage door reading “The Devroom - Computer and Technology Repair”, a logo which matched the faded stitching below his name on the old dirty mechanics cover-alls he wore proudly over a pair of scuffed old red converse Chuck Taylors. The garage itself was filled with every type of old technology you could imagine - CRT monitors, mechanical keyboards, Furby’s with the face missing but somehow it’s less off-putting that way? You name it, he had it on some shelf or table, along with a cash register and a litany of small tools splayed out next to it. 


“You said you got a job interview today, didn’t you?” a deep, croaky voice interrupted his inventory. Dev turned around to see his mountain of a father standing in the doorway into the house at the back of the garage, abject disappointment and judgement written across his weathered features almost as heavily as his 1980’s The Whispers ass mustache he refused to get rid of. It was Dev’s dad - Devlin Durwood Jr.


“Of course, big daddio!” Dev squeaked out in return, patting the dust off the front of his coveralls with a wide grin. “It’s a fourth interview with the super secret science organization Gestalt!  I hacked into their database online last month and they jumped at the opportunity to work with me! If all goes according to my big brain plan I’ll be a super scientist slash cryptozoologist by the end of the day! And I’ll still have time to watch the newest episode of My Little Sister Can’t Be This Cute on Crunchyroll - not a sponsor, but it could be!”


Dev’s dad just stared, a deep blankness in his eyes that not only gave away the fact he had no clue what the fuck his son was talking about, but even moreso the fact he would never give a flying fuck about any of it as well. He sighed the heaving, resigned sigh of a man who had given up on his dreams because his son was a disgusting fucking dweebus, and walked past Dev toward his SUV parked outside the garage because his son had filled his garage up with stupid nerd computer horseshit that would make certain he never gets laid, let alone ever moves the fuck out of the house even though he’s 23 fucking years old now.


Uh… maybe a history lesson is in order here.


Devlin Durwood was an all-star football player, a running back for The Buffalo Bills for seven straight seasons, in the 1960’s. He was a force of nature on the field, nicknamed “The Stampede” because of his ability to destroy defensive lines single-handedly. He was hailed as a pioneer for African Americans in the sport as well as in American society in general for his pro-Black community leadership. This will make sense for the rest of the story in a second, just hold the fuck on. Jesus. This is all important.


Devlin Durwood Jr., nicknamed Big Devil, played for The Buffalo Bills in the 90’s as a tight end and lived up to his nickname with the fear he incited in the hearts of every other team that stepped onto the field with him. The Durwood name was a legacy now - a sign of the quality of a man on the field and in real life.


Devlin Durwood the Third, nicknamed Dev, was a tiny fucking virgin nerd that barely broke 100 pounds at 5’4” tall at age 23. Instead, as far as his dad was concerned, he had destroyed the family legacy so she could stick his dick in CD trays and brag about his ability to megabyte and megablow at everything that actually mattered in life.


“I’m proud of you, dear. And so is your father, RIGHT Devlin?” another voice broke the tense silence between disgruntled father and oblivious son. As always, it was Dev’s mother Kacey Devlin playing bridge-mender in the family, this time standing in the doorway in her robe and sipping a cup of coffee while staring daggers at her husband.


“Maybe if he could throw a fucking football further than my dick…” Dev’s father grumbled under his breath, opening his side door, sliding in quickly, then slamming it closed behind him before he had to hear any more guff. The SUV was started, pulled out, and gone before anyone else could fit in another word. A skill developed after years of practice on his part.


“A baby could throw a football further.” Kacey muttered then turned back to look at Dev who was packing up a satchel with some tools and brickabrack, completely unaware of his dad’s open disdain. “You got everything you’re gonna need, honey?”


“Oh don’t you worry about me! You know my slogan - always be prepared… FOR GHOULS!” he thrust his index finger into the air with those last words, the force of motion causing his gigantic glasses to fumble on his face.


“Mhm.” his mom muttered matter-of-factly, walking back into the house. “I only dropped him a couple times as a baby, they couldn’t press any charges about it, he’s probably fine.”


You see, The Devroom repair shop was all just a front for Dev’s one true love - monster hunting! Ever since he was little and he first ran the equations, statistics, and probabilities using his prodigious intellect and near-endless amount of free time with not a single friend to his name Dev had found one thing to be absolutely true over all others - there were cryptids roaming the dark corners of this world and he was going to be the one to prove it one and for all! And ever since that day, barring a few years he spent self-abusing in the downstairs bathroom after he discovered what a titty was, he had devoted every waking moment of his life to that cause!


Dev threw a leg over his lime green Vespa scooter, revved it to life with a sound like a lawn mower barely functioning (thank you to my neighbors for the foley work), and then threw it into high gear - which in the Vespa’s case was drive - to take off down the street. It was gonna be a long drive, especially at 20 miles per hour, but he was wearing his favorite bike helmet, had his favorite math rap tunes blaring in his headphones, and had packed seven different flavors of capri-sun in his bag. He was ready for the long haul to reach his destination - Whitesville, Connecticut.


The sun was hanging low in the sky, dipping towards its inevitable deep embrace in the horizon by the time Dev had arrived at city limits, his little Vepsa put-putting up the turnoff into town and then down mainstreet. 


It was a weird place for a super secret science organization to be setting up shop, he couldn’t help but take note. On every porch and out in every lawn was the blank, staring face of some local yokel with judgement rit across their features heavy - but Dev was mostly unmoved by the expression these days, having lived with his father every day of his life, so he put-putted onward.


Halfway down mainstreet he turned into the driveway of a single family ranch home with wide open windows shaded in heavy curtains, with a large sedan parked in the driveway. He stared at the seemingly normal front door for a long time before making the short hike over to it. 


Ding-Dong


The standard suburban doorbell rang out into the cavernous darkness of the house beyond the bland front door marked with buffed gold numerals stating it as 111 Main Street. There was something off-putting about the mundanity of it all but Dev couldn’t put his finger on it. There was a long pause, thankfully long enough for Dev to catch his breath from the walk up - these front yards in this town were no joke! It reminded him of his dark days of Wii Fit. Days he’d sooner forget entirely.


The front door swung open, revealing a gigantic white man with a tightly shaved blonde crew cut wearing what could barely pass for undercover cop clothing in that awkward ass way people wore civvies after spending their entire lives in uniforms. The behemoth of a honkey glared down at Dev with daggers in his bland grey eyes, his thick jaw sinking in a heavily lined frown.


“I’m here to save the whole company, bucko!” Dev spat out with a massive grin and an offered handshake to the large man.


“Welcome, Mr. Durwood. We’ve been expecting you. Come in.” the gigantic man ignored his greeting and instead took a step to the side to step out of the doorway. He motioned Dev in, who obliged without even a wisp of sense of the danger he was currently in, a huge smile upon his pock-marked features.


“Well don’t mind if I diddly-do!” Dev squeaked out, shoving his hands into his coverall pockets and rocking back and forth on his heels as he looked around the living room he now stood within. He barely took stock of the fact that every piece of furniture and household appliance in the place looked stock new and yet still had a thin covering of dust all over it. Maybe that’s how secret geniuses fuck around, who knows. A lot of his stuff has a thin covering of Cheeto-dust after all.


The gigantic man shut the door and eyeballed the tiny young man warily. “I gotta admit, when they told me you were just gonna show up and walk in for me to take you out, I was kinda apprehensive but I guess you really don’t know what hell’s even going on here, do you?”


“Of course I do, sir! I’m here for my fourth interview to join Gestalt!” Dev beamed with pride, pushing his thick glasses back up the bridge of his nose with his index finger.


“...Interview?” the large man scratched at the back of his head and glanced around the room for a moment before laying his eyes back on Dev again. “Wait, you did three interviews before this? With Gestalt?” he sounded incredulous but mostly confused.


“That’s right, General! I hacked into the experimental database your code monkeys tossed together out of sticks and stones between banana breaks and found out about your secret scientific experiments with the human genome! That was test one.” Dev smirked a classic overconfident dweeb smirk.


“It’s Colonel. Colonel Hawk. And yeah, I knew about that. That’s why they invited you here for me to wring your neck and whatnot.”


“Yeah! So that was interview one, and then I–.. pardon, ring my neck?” Dev interrupted himself.


“Go on, go on. What was interview number two then? We’re always on the lookout for actual good candidates.” Hawk urged him on.


“For the second, I downloaded a bunch of your hyper-encrypted files on a bunch of cryptids and peruuuuused them at my leisure!” Dev chuckled, then shook his head, “Amatuer work, really. You didn’t even have Bigfoot in there! Ape OR monster truck. Shameful rookie mistake.”


Hawk nodded toward the kitchen, but when Dev looked where he was looking, no one was there. So he continued, “Anyway! For my third and final act, I sent a mass e-mail to everyone in your HR department with proof of what I’d done, my resume complete with home address, and a photo of me as Indiana Jones from Steel City Comicon last year! I was a SHOE-IN to get called in to join up as a super secret cryptid scientist lookin’ that dapper!” he snort-laughed for a couple of seconds while Hawk tried not to look him directly in the eyes because of the intense secondhand embarrassment he felt. 


“Look kid, I’m gonna level with ya, we didn’t bring you here for another interview. We brought you here to tie up loose ends, if you get me. Like tying up your corpse in a corpse bag and tossing into a shallow grave if you feel me. Like murdering you, if you catch my drift. To death.” 


“Well that’s less than what I was hoping for. “ Dev said uncomfortably, tugging at his white t-shirt collar beneath the flaps of his coveralls. “Could I at least get an internship instead?”


“We’re always looking for new henchmen. You ever henched before?” Hawk asked matter-of-factly, waving his hand in a small circular motion in the air toward the kitchen.


Four men in hazmat suits, carrying buckets marked “Hazardous Cleaning Materials” and carrying long poles tipped with sponges filed out of the kitchen, having been completely unseen before, and out the front door, each of them nodding politely to Hawk as they passed him.


Dev watched them silently, a single trickle of sweat running down the side of his face. “I could hench.”


“You seem like a smart kid, you figured out all that tech mumbo-jumbo, maybe you can be one of the technician nerds that do whatever the hell it is that type of person does. Not touch a tit, I imagine. But probably something useful too. You into that kinda thing?”


“I would love to touch a tit, if that’s on the table.” Dev said much more energetically, as if the imminent horrific danger he had just realized he was in melted away the instant there was even the slightest chance he could cop a feel. “I’m gonna be honest, I don’t remember what you said before that.”


“You’ll be a technician, fine.” Hawk stood up to his full height once more, scratching at the bottom of his jaw right where his neck met his chin. Dev hadn’t noticed before that there was a strange liquid slowly oozing out of what seemed to be a sewing seam in his skin there. The realization sent a shudder through him that froze him solid in that moment.


“Gestalt isn’t a cryptozoology organization, kid. We’re working on the next evolution of humanity. The next step in existence itself. We do whatever needs to be done to assure that humans won’t have to stay frail and short-lived forever. This organization isn’t a job - it’s a calling from God himself.” Hawk knelt down and placed a hand on Dev’s shoulder, the two of them being eye-to-eye for the first time since their little meeting began. Dev couldn’t help but notice that the larger man’s pupils seemed quite thin and jagged this close up. This revelation did nothing to calm his growing fear, or coax him to speak again.


“...whatever.” Hawk stood back up and dusted his tucked in polo shirt off, then motioned towards the door. “I’ve got another job to go to - an experiment I’m supposed to oversee after I… well, y’know. You can ride along and get some experience under your belt before we sign the checks.”


Dev immediately popped back into the conversation, “Checks? Oh yeah! I’m still gonna get paid for all of this?”


“Well… yeah. We’re not monsters.” Hawk chuckled.


“Prodigious! I can finally move out of my parents house and take as long of a shower as I want without anyone accusing me of trying to suck my own dick in the tub!” Dev fistpumped in the air.


“Can we… can we just leave?” Hawk asked with tension in his features. “My car is parked outside.”


Dev walked outside into the dawn of the golden hour, squinting against the sun as it slowly slid toward its restbed once more. Hawk shut the door behind them and didn’t even bother locking it. He ushered the small man down the driveway to the large sedan parked near the street.


“Uh… look, don’t kill me or anything for being curious but where’d my Vespa go? I only had two payments left on that baby until she was finally mine and all the sexy chicas that come with it!” Dev asked.


“We had a hench pick it up and take it to the next location we’re stopping at. You might end up doing some of that kinda work, it’s gopher stuff.” Hawk stood by the driver’s side door and looked thoughtful for a moment. “You know how to dissolve a body by any chance?”


“I mean… theoretically…” Dev sputtered in return.


“Uhp, look what blew in from Bozo Town.” Hawk interrupted, motioning with a jerk of his gigantic tree-trunk neck across the street toward two men walking down the sidewalk adjacent. One was a tall young man in a jean jacket with fiery red hair and angry, sunken eyes, and the other was a slovenly short balding man who looked like he reeked of cheese. “Didn’t know anyone else was scheduled to visit.”


The redheaded man caught sight of them staring and threw a hand up in the eye, immediately screaming out, “HEY! HEY YOU TWO!” in their direction. 


“Pretend you’re a normal guy.” Hawk whispered in a harsh hiss at Dev, leaning over the side of the car like the two of them were having a normal conversation over it.


Dev placed his hands on his hips, arms akimbo, and bent at the waist like a jaunty victorian lad who was craving berries and cream, the closest approximation in his mind of an average guy pose. Hawk looked physically harmed at the sight of it. 


“WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU LOOKING AT?!” the redheaded man screamed out, jogging across the road towards them.


“Just get in the fucking car!” Hawk hissed out hoarsely again, yanking the driver’s side door open and ducking inside of it quickly. 


Dev yanked at the door three times before it finally clicked unlocked at the exact moment he wasn’t pulling the handle any longer and he could slide inside and slam the door shut behind him as well.


Hawk threw it into gear and backed up out of his driveway onto main street, swiveling the car around and positioning it perfectly to drive away - just in time for the redheaded man’s fists to slam down harshly into the rattling metal of the car’s trunk, causing the entire vehicle to bounce wildly on it’s old shocks. 


“I’M TALKIN’ TO YOU, YOU FUCKING LOOKEY-LOO BASTARDS! GET OUT HERE AND FUCKIN TELL ME WHERE MY BROTHER IS! DON’T MAKE ME COME IN THERE!


“Fucking shit!” Hawk yelled out, gunning it as hard as he could and peeling the fuck out away from the ginger lunatic assaulting his car for having glanced at him. He swung the car around the exit to town and onto the highway, continuing to gun it down the old road outside of town until neither passenger could see the suburb any longer.


“Who WAS that?!” Dev panted, gripping hard onto the vinyl seat he sat upon to steady himself.


“Fuck if I know.” Hawk muttered, slipping a cigarette out of his polo shirt’s breaks pocket and sticking it between his lips. He fumbled for the car lighter for a moment before using it to singe the end of his smoke to life. “Don’t worry about it, Snake’ll take care of him.”


“Who’s Snake?” Dev asked blandly.


Hawk looked at him for a moment and then back at the road. “Shut the fuck up before I find a locker and stuff you into it like giblets into a turkey ass, kid. We’ve got a ways to drive and I’m already tired of you.”


After a short drive, Dev was extra confused when there was a police blockade at the city limits of the next town, some little podunk place called Kirby, but the cops just moved it out of their way and waved them through. They even nodded at Hawk specifically. Dev decided it was best not to ask any questions.


Well, maybe just one, “Do you guys know the Mothman?”


Hawk didn’t even respond, though.


Eventually they pulled up to an industrial park a few miles out of town on the other end - a gigantic concrete sign announcing it as Harbury Industrial Park as they drove in. Two black delivery trucks sat parked on either side of the main entrance when they pulled up and a man in black sunglasses and a baseball cap nodded at Hawk as he passed. 


Hawk didn’t even bother parking, just stopping the car between the two heavy delivery vehicles and stepping out instantly. Dev followed suit, mostly out of fear but also out of an awkward sense of social requirement. 


“The building is completely secure. All standard communication lines have been severed.” the man with the hat and sunglasses whispered to Hawk when the two had met up in front of the double doors.


“Are the civilians still unaware of our presence?” Hawk whispered in return.


“Fourty-eight in the building, including the target from the previous office job.”


“Alright. Inject the fungal spore.” Hawk ordered. 


The double doors on the back of one of the delivery trucks exploded open on his command, a half a dozen men in gas masks, bulletproof vests, and combat boots leaping out one after another carrying silver unmarked tanks on their backs with spigot-tipped hoses. Dev took a few steps back in fear of the foot soldiers as they burst through the front doors and began charging into every room on the first floor and up the stairs beyond.


The screams inside were horrific and every muscle in Dev’s body burned for him to turn and run, but as if on cue Hawk’s hand gripped tight onto his shoulder and dragged him a few steps back toward the front door.


“The fungal agent doesn’t kill anyone. It seeps into electronics and acts as a viral EMP. No cell phone calls in or out. No photographs. No messaging. One of the only useful inventions the eggheads in R&D cooked up between diddling their gaping useless assholes with company money. We’re securing the building for extraction.” Hawk shoved Dev toward the front door hard, and pointed in after. “Now go. You have a job to do here too.”


Dev timidly walked into the building, and at the harsh guidance of each shove by Hawk, found himself ascending the stairs to the second floor. From his peripheral vision he could see people being held at gunpoint downstairs, each of them on their knees with their hands behind their heads. The dread within his chest threatened to burst his heart from its cage with how it overwhelmed him, but he kept moving.


Finally the shoving stopped when Dev found himself standing at the entrance to a large cubicle farm, everyone posing much like they were downstairs with guns pointed at them and each person on their knees on the floor. The sound of soft sobbing here and there drove home harshly just how real the situation was.


“He’s over here.” a muffled voice called from behind one of the gas masks. 


Hawk strode across the room, leaving Dev standing by the double doors. Two gas-masked men stood on either side of a heavyset man on his knees in the middle of the room, their submachine guns trained on either side of his head. He wore a wide-brimmed stetson hat and a pair of sunglasses, and didn’t seem to show much concern for the horrifically dangerous situation he’d found himself in.


“Cowboy Bob.” Hawk said matter-of-factly, standing over the kneeling cowpoke on the floor. “You think you can just walk free as a jaybird after having witnessed a Gestalt operation?”


“I reckon I don’t much cotton to the question, hombre.” Cowboy Bob returned in his smokey southern drawl, looking up front beneath the brim of his stetson with revulsion in his eyes at Hawk’s very being. “I ain’t seen nothin’ out of the ordinary til today. I’m just a standard ol’ office worker cowboy, workin’ my 9 to 5 on my way to the old dusty trail in the sky we all mosey on off to eventually.”


“BULLSHIT, COWBOY BOB!” Hawk yelled, veins popping from his forehead and neck. “You were the only survivor of the Second Generation Chrysalid Experiment and you wanna try and tell me that was a huge fucking coincidence? You just HAPPENED to leave at just the right time?”


“My son got killed in a campin’ accident the night before, mister. I had to attend to his headless corpse and funerary arrangements and whatnot. Classic cowboy things, you wouldn’t understand. “ Cowboy Bob hissed through clenched teeth.


“Do I have to be here for this, or…?” Dev finally interjected.


Both Hawk and Cowboy Bob just glared at him, causing him to take a step back into silence immediately. 


“I’ll give you one last chance to join the right side of history, Cowboy Bob.” Hawk returned to his interrogation. 


“Sometimes, hombre… on the outside I’m rootin’ tootin’... but on the inside? I’m well aware I’ve yee’d my last haw.” Cowboy Bob said somberly, hanging his head. But then raised his eyes up above his sunglasses to glare back at Hawk. “But you’re gonna have to be one rough n’ tumble sonofabitch to slap leather with ol’ Cowboy Bob, city slicker!”


Cowboy Bob raised up suddenly, slamming his forehead into the gas mask of one of his guards, sending him stumbling back into the copier and dumping paper and plastic trays all over the floor as he fumbled over it. With one quick swing of his leg, the second guard went tumbling to the ground, slamming into it and shattering the glass lenses in his gas mask. 


Cowboy Bob took off at a run, his hands still tied behind his back with metal manacles, but that didn’t slow him down at all. He turned his shoulder toward the giant glass window at the end of the cubicle farm, and leapt straight into it.


Glass exploded into every direction, and Cowboy Bob flew out of the window, disappearing over the edge of it as he leapt. There was a moment of silence after, before gunshots began to ring out loudly outside the building. 


“He’s escaping on foot! Code 11! I repeat, code 11! We can’t hit him!” a voice crackled to life over a radio laying on the ground next to the second guard who had been keeping Cowboy Bob in check before. He scrambled to pick it up but Hawk knelt down and slapped his hand away violently, picking it up himself. 


“I’ll handle Cowboy Bob myself. You release Subject Number 2 to clean up. We’re done here.”


Dev, for his part, was cowering behind a cubicle wall, barely peering over the top of it like the world’s sissiest Kilroy Wuz Here graffiti. Hawk turned and pointed a sharp finger at him, the man’s eyes bloodshot and wide.


“YOU!”


“FUCK!” Dev screamed out instantly.


“Get down to the basement and retrieve the main server backup. We’re torching the rest of it. Prove yourself to Gestalt and you’ll be rewarded!” He turned to walk away but stopped and turned back, speaking from between gritted teeth. “Fail Gestalt… and be punished in a manner you cannot even begin to conceive of.”


Colonel Hawk then turned and ran toward the shattered open window at the other end of the cubicle farm and leapt out of it, disappearing over the edge just as Cowboy Bob had before. The sound of a bird screaming out its hunting call in the distance rang out between the buildings of the industrial park.


Dev ran. Pretty fucking instantly. I’d love to tell you all of his pee stayed inside of his balls where it belonged but shit happens. In this case just piss happens instead of shit but only because he went at a gas station before he got to the interview earlier. 


“I gotta get out, I gotta get out, I gotta get out…!” Dev repeated to himself feverishly, running downstairs past where all the armed guards once were. But now they were gone? He was suddenly confused enough to stop running at the bottom of the stairs. All of the office workers were alive, kneeling and standing around panting and frantically trying to explain their situation to one another. Did Gestalt just leave them as witnesses?


The exploding sound of glass, metal, and stone bursting inward answered his questions in a manner he had never fathomed in this situation. Which was ironic since he had devoted his entire life to that exact manner up until this point. You see, a monster was running full tilt up the foyer hallway toward him in that moment - proving everything he had ever wanted to believe, but in a way that ruined it all for him in a single moment.


The thing was gigantic, and covered in a wet green chitonous armour in segments that grinded against one another as it moved. Two gigantic black orbs of eyes pierced into Dev’s very soul with the endless abyss within them, a skittering set of mandibles below it flying open and closed as viscous green liquid ejected from it for each movement. It drew it’s human-like arm back, and a long black prehensile blade exploded out of it like a bone dislocating, creating a bloody, shining scythe in the open air that it swung from behind it like a guillotine.


Dev dropped to the floor in a heap, his legs giving out from under him at the exact correct time for the insectoid horror to fly overtop of him, its massive body crumbling the metal stairs under its weight and the wall beyond it like paper mache. Blood flashed into the air as the beast hacked through human flesh and bone like a thresher through wheat - sending body parts flying through the air like the chaff into walls and bouncing against floors amidst the short-cut screams of its victims. 


Dev crawled along the floor, the massive beast leaping through walls across one side of the hallway to the other, causing the entire building to shake and collapse in violent bursts in on itself as the very stability of the office began to give way to the bloodbath that Dev could not see with his head down so low against the ground. 


It took him what felt like a lifetime crawling and fumbling across the floor like a cartoon forest creature trying to escape a huntsman in a comedic oil slick trap but the oil was a bunch of fucked up blood and shit and Elmer Fudd was Cricketman instead. You get it. 


Finally he managed to lay hands on the free-hanging remnants of the front door to the building and shove it aside to charge out into the chilly dusk air. The sun was barely peaking above the horizon now and the limited light made it hard to see but he still searched frantically around for any chance of escape he could possibly find.


The two delivery trucks, as well as the old sedan Hawk had brought him in, were completely gone. But there, parked across the front parking lot, like a beacon in the cold oncoming night, was his beautiful lime green Vespa, keys dangling from the ignition. Some henchman had brought it along to where they were headed, just like Hawk had said. 


He fumbled over to it, jumped onto it, and frantically tried and failed to start it over and over, the engine just not turning over when he needed it most. 


The carnage behind him was mounting, and mounting, louder and louder, until finally the entire two story brick office building came crashing down, sending a massive wave of dust and debris out into the parking lot on top of him, but thankfully most of it collapsing inward on itself.


The Vepsa roared to life, finally - or really just kinda vweee-weee’d to life like a Vespa do, and Dev peered down into the sideview mirror with wide, trembling eyes. 


He could see the shape of the horrific creature, heaving in and out on itself as it breathed heavily from its toil. Its dark black eyes turned toward Dev, but action finally surged in his veins and he yanked back the Vespa to point it away from the danger, and zoomed off down the road toward safety.


Dev had a long ride home to think about what he had seen. To try and fail for so long to calm down and rationalize his experience. By the time he’d arrived back to his parents house and parked his Vespa, he had mostly regained what composure he ever had. He stumbled back into the garage he called his repair shop and slumped down into the lawn chair behind the front counter, placing his forehead in his hands. 


“You fail horribly again, son?” Dev’s dad stood in the doorway to the house, glowering down at his son, wearing his Buffalo Bills branded house robe and matching slippers and holding his fifth or sixth beer of the night.


“No, Dad…. not this time, I didn’t.” Dev cracked a wide toothy grin, holding up his cell phone to show his dad what was illuminated on his cracked screen. An entire album folder of photos and videos of Hawk explaining Gestalt, the gas masked men holding people at gunpoint, and even the horrific cricket monster that had killed everyone inside. 


“....YOU WENT TO A MONSTER MOVIE INSTEAD OF YOUR INTERVIEW?! YOU’RE NEVER GONNA MOVE OUT, ARE YOU?!” Dev’s dad screamed out, slamming his fist into the bannister next to the garage door.


“Don’t be silly, daddio! I bypassed a viral fungus EMP using only standard Android phone technology in order to get video evidence of the existence of REAL cryptids and the super secret evil human experimentation organization that makes ‘em! I’m gonna be the most famous cryptozoologist the world has ever known and you’re worried about some dumb job interview!” Dev boasted loudly, holding the phone up even higher for his dad to see. “We’re gonna be set for life once I get these photos to Crackpot dot com!


“I DON’T KNOW WHAT ANY OF THAT MEANS! GET THE FUCK TO BED!” his dad screamed in return.


And so he did.

The End
