	"They say the witch of the woods is still out there... they cut off her husband's head by guillotine for consorting with evil spirits and she sold her soul to the devil for revenge... They say she kills anyone who trespasses on her husbands grave... and she lives in THIS VERY FOREST!"
</p>
<p>
	The assembled faces illuminated around the flickering campfire light were less scared by the tale of lost love, revenge, and witches magic than they were completely plastered on a potent combination of Bartles & James and Zima's dredged up from the bottom of someone's uncles' forgotten old cellar freezer.
</p>
<p>
	A type of drunk not felt since people thought Flock of Seagulls were the height of fashion and Trickle Down Reaganomics could be mentioned casually by a Ninja Turtle.
</p>
<p>
	All except for one, Mark Steinbrenner, who hadn't heard a word of the entire sordid tale thanks to the sound of his own heartbeat drumming in his ears. His eyes were focused tightly onto Emily Rosenbaum, who was seated across from him wearing her most flattering cheerleading sweater, which is probably a real thing but if it isn't then this is a fantasy story and it's real in this setting, fuck you.
</p>
<p>
	For her part, Emily was politely pretending not to notice Mark's constant vigilant gaze, partly as not to hurt his feelings in any way and partly because she was genuinely pretending it wasn't happening with every fiber of her being, as hard as she possibly could. She was paying as much attention as this situation would allow to her boyfriend Harvey's tall tale. "That was a good one, babe! Not a clich√© or derivative set up at all, Jeff, I mean Harvey!"
</p>
<p>
	"That's too lame, Harvey! You can't expect us to buy that horse shit, can you? You're bullshitting more than your dad did in divorce court. He lost it all to that mean ol' bitch mom o' yours!" Greg said with a loud braying laugh that echoed off of the jagged old oak trees that surrounded the clearing. Greg is a giant piece of shit, but we'll get back to that.
</p>
<p>
	"What the fuck did you just say to me, you fucking cuck?! You fucking liberanal beta cuck leftist woke mob crisis actor?!" Harvey bellowed, leaping up from the log bench and throwing both hands around Greg's throat. He began shaking the smaller boy back and forth by his neck violently.
</p>
<p>
	"Harvey, don't!" Emily yelled "Hey voted for Nader!"
</p>
<p>
	"WHOA there pardner!" Cowboy Bill shouted as he threw himself between the two of them, his spurs clinking in the darkness. Both Emily and Mark grabbed the boys and pulled them apart as best they could. "Let's rustle up some understanding and rope n' brand us some forgiveness, 'fore high noon rolls around!"
</p>
<p>
	"Did you hear what this grodey little chode said to me?!" Harvey yelled, swinging his fists over Cowboy Bill's head, disheveling his perfect ten gallon white stetson cowboy hat with tooled leather banding and dipped crown.
</p>
<p>
	"Your mom said plenty to me... about my dick! It's apparently very long and strong not to even MENTION bound to get the friction on!" Greg sneered back, yanking his head away from each of Harvey's wild swinging hands.
</p>
<p>
	"I'VE HEARD ENOUGH OUTTA -BOTH- A YOU VARMINTS!!" Cowboy Bill bellowed, causing everyone to stop in their tracks and look to him. "Now we ain't gonna beat John Adams High School next week in the big Eastern Conference Showdown Bowl if'n we turn on each other now!"
</p>
<p>
	There was a moment of tense silence before both boys solemnly nodded. "Sorry Cowboy Bill..." they said in unison.
</p>
<p>
	"You guys are gonna kill em at the Big Bowl Football Alliance Game." Mark said, pushing up his coke bottle glasses, adjusting his retainer, cleaning his braces, rubbing his oily pimply skin, hiking up his pants further and adjusting his pocket protector. He's a nerd, is what I'm getting at.
</p>
<p>
	Cowboy Bill pulled Harvey and Greg into a huddle and whispered low between them, "And don't forget, we brought this dweeb Mark up here to do heinous but blatantly homoerotic shit to him which will embarass and ostrasize HIM and not us for some reason!"
</p>
<p>
	The three of them turned their eyes back to Mark like cats in a cartoon leer at a mouse, like straight outta fucking Tom & Jerry - you know the one with the black cat with the cigar and derby hat who works with Tom? Uh.. anyway
</p>
<p>
	"What's up, my new best friends group?" Mark said, dweebily.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh we just got a favor to ask of you, Skidmark. That's your new cool group nickname by the way, it's way more dangerous like uh.. like a motorcycle thing. Skidmark!" Greg said while barely containing his laughter with his hand.
</p>
<p>
	If this was real life you'd have to be a genuine fucking moron not to realize something was up at this point, but Mark didn't. He lit up, leaning forward on his log with a bright smile over his oily little cherub's face. "Oh boy! I'm Skidmark now! That's way better than my list nickname... Pantshitter!What do you want me to do, buddies?"
</p>
<p>
	"We just need ya to go into the woods and collect some more wood for the fire!" Harvey said, " Can you handle that ya little piss-pants fuckboy bitch I mean ol' pal?"
</p>
<p>
	"Will it help us win the Bowlerama Tournament Game?!" Mark said with the excitement of a small dog about to piss itself.
</p>
<p>
	"...uh.. yeah, sure cowpoke. It'll help us win the Championship Tournament Footie division. Whatever'n y'all need ta' hear to get the fuck outta here." Cowboy Bill said, exchanging glances with the other boys.
</p>
<p>
	"OH BOY OH BOY!" Mark said, leaping up and charging off into the darkness just outside the ring of gnarled trees surrounding the glade. A few moments of silence following before a thin white light clicked on past the trees and continued on.
</p>
<p>
	All three boys groaned and Emily laughed. "He took the flashlight, you sentient cumrags. What are you gonna do now, stumble around in the dark playing grabass trying to scare the little twerp for the rest of the night?"
</p>
<p>
	The boys exchanged glances and Harvey shook his head, grinning to himself. "Nah, we're just gonna let him get lost out there. We've got plenty of Bartles & James left, let's party!"
</p>
<p>
	They all four cheered and began popping tops and clinking bottles of that refreshing fruity wine cooler available anywhere better liquor is sold. But Greg split off from the group and walked to the edge of the grove to take a piss.
</p>
<p>
	He stumbled around in the dark playing grabass as was earlier predicted for a few minutes before he completely tripped over something hard and sturdy, falling face first into the sodden earth behind it. "What the ominous story element fuck?!" he exclaimed, fumbling back up to his feet and squinting his eyes against the darkness. He had tripped over a small marble tablet sticking out of the ground, with a broken cross on top of it, though not upright like most would be. It was rough hewn and far too dark for Greg to make out the name written on the front of it so instead he just dropped trow and took a long, nasty fucking drunk Zima piss all over it.
</p>
<p>
	"HAR HAR!" Greg guffawed like a complete fucking moron. And to even take it a step further how fucking stupid this dude is, he drew back and kicked the pissy stone out of the ground and into a nearby thicket bush, laughing the entire time. Dude didn't even care he got his own piss on his sneakers like what the fuck?
</p>
<p>
	The steady hum of the wind blowing between the leaves suddenly stopped.
</p>
<p>
	Mark was wandering through the fallen Autumn leaves, each step crunching loudly as he timidly pressed on through the darkness. His flashlight bobbed up and down, illuminating the slight dirt trail in front of him as he darted from one side of it to the other to pick up small sticks wherever he could find him.
</p>
<p>
	"Skidmark to the rescuuueee!!" he whisper-yelled, posing heroically with the bundle of sticks beneath his arm and the flashlight pointed at the sky. This is the exact moment that the wind stopped in the deep dark woods and unfortunately for Mark also the moment his flashlight went dim. He dropped the bundle of sticks and began to smack his flashlight against his palm over and over. "C'mon, c'mon..! I'm gonna #2 my courderoy shorts...!"
</p>
<p>
	But no light came. The only thing lighting the trail now was the pale, dim light of the waning moon overhead, peering down into the woods through interwoven webs of branch and tree like a single lidless eye ever-present and ever-watching. Mark shuddered.
</p>
<p>
	He looked around as best he could, squinting in the darkness, until what he saw caused him to clench every muscle in his body, but you KNOW especially his bhole TIGHT.
</p>
<p>
	Across the trail from him in the distance light from the moon reflected perfectly in three sets of eyes, staring unblinkingly directly at him. He shivered in the dark but moved not a single muscle as he met their stare, his eyes saucer-dish wide. The complete silence of the woods was broken then by the croaking of frogs. The eyes.. they were frogs. Of course, duh! Mark's b-hole loosened to its normal circumfrence which was none of your business, thank you very much.
</p>
<p>
	He turned and continued to slap the flashlight and jangle the batteries within as he tried to trace his steps back to the camp. He didn't remember going far enough out that he wouldn't be able to see the campfire but it was nowhere in sight so he must have.
</p>
<p>
	He'd only gotten a dozen feet down the path before he was stopped dead in his tracks. A loomingly large black shape stood in the path before him, not having slowly walked toward him, or having stepped from the bushes or something - it simple wasn't there and then was. It moved so slowly at first as to be impercetible. Mark backstepped away from it only once and between blinks the shape was upon him, it's hands reaching out through the still night and grasping at either shoulder with digging, forceful fingertips.
</p>
<p>
	"AAAAHHHHHHH!!" Mark screamed, closing his eyes and wincing away, but a familiar guffaw stopped his vocalizing instantly. He opened his eyes and Greg stood before him, enveloped in the darkness still, but completely recognizable in his stupid cutoff denim vest like he was somehow even shitter Bono.
</p>
<p>
	"God damn Shitmark, you're twice the bitchboy we thought you were!" Greg continued his guffawing, slapping Mark on the shoulder a few times.
</p>
<p>
	"I just... I just didn't know it was you..! And it's SKIDMARK, not shitmark, that's mean!"
</p>
<p>
	"Whatever, let's just get back. Come on, Skidmark." Greg walked past Mark now, not in the direction Mark had remembered coming from the campfire, but in the complete opposite direction. Back where Mark had gotten lost.
</p>
<p>
	"That's... uhm.. that's not the right way, Greg. " Mark offered timidly.
</p>
<p>
	Greg stopped in place. "You're not trynna be a lil' cuck boy are ya...? I ain't even drilled your mom for oil yet and you're whinin' at me like I'm your stepdad. "
</p>
<p>
	Mark grimaced, "Look my stepdad Steve is a good guy, ok! He even gave me the Hewlett-Packard from his last marraige, it barely has any chip crumbs in the keyboard, AND it has 3D Pinball Space Cadet on it, so... so eat my butt!"
</p>
<p>
	Greg's shoulders slumped and something fell onto the ground in front of him with a wet, putrid slorp. The squelching sound of wet movement continued as his body began to convulse slightly, twitching back and forth in the darkness. Then the horrid cacophony began... twisting, snapping, crunching bones... every kind of painful, violent sound filled the silent night as his body did not turn toward Mark.. but contorted, shivering and shaking back and forth til he met face to face.
</p>
<p>
	But even in the darkness, Mark knew the god awful truth of Greg, now. The moon illuminated just enough to see the gaping, seeping, bone-filled crevasse where Greg's head and chest had been, ripped and rendeded away to reveal a maw of unfathomable gore. A voice came from deep within the void where Greg once was, gutteral and inhuman "You shouldn't have said that...."
</p>
<p>
	Mark's scream echoed off of every tree in the woods, and he ran as fast as he could, back toward the campsite, toward his friends, toward any measily modicum of the idea of safety. His feet beat against the ground hard, mud spattering in each footfalls wake, but he never, not once, dared to look behind him.
</p>
<p>
	"My lost love demands blood...blood!" the screaming, twisted, inhuman voice called out through the woods behind him, the voice echoing as if miles away but felt painfully close to just behind his ear.
</p>
<p>
	He ran through complete silence, only the sound of his own breathing, his own feet, could be heard for so long, but still no fire came into sight. After what felt like an eternity of running the silence was split by a soul-curdling scream in the far distance. But it was human... A girl's scream... Emily!
</p>
<p>
	Mark turned in that direction and ran, instinctively, with no idea why or what he would do when he got there, he ran. Tree limbs scraped his face, spider webs stuck to his skin, brambles tore into him, and he didn't stop, didn't even slow down, until he crested the edge of the gnarled oaks back into the familiar clearing where the camp had once been.
</p>
<p>
	But now there was no fire, only further darkness, and standing at the edge of the clearing was Harvey, his arms drawn above his head, and clasped between his two meaty hands was a gigantic stick. He brandished it for purpose and drew it back to strike in front of him.. and there on the ground, screaming and pleading for her life through tears was Emily, backing away and holding her hands up - begging for her life.
</p>
<p>
	"No.. no.. you can't--" the stick came down onto her face, over and over again, the sound almost as horrific as that which followed Mark through the woods for all this time.
</p>
<p>
	Mark closed the distance between himself and Harvey quickly, pausing only to grab the shovel they had brought along to quench the fire they made. Mark was never very athletic, but fear and adrenaline surged through him this night and when he swung the shovel at this thing that he knew was once Harvey's head, it hit true, and it hit hard, sending him spiraling toward the ground in a pile.
</p>
<p>
	Mark dropped to the ground beside Harvey, staring wall-eyed at what he had done. Harvey slowly bled out onto the grass and dirt, motionless, his eyes open but no life flickering behind him. Mark could not look away, his hands trembling as he dropped the shovel onto the ground.
</p>
<p>
	Then....they laughed. Harvey and Emily both. Shrill, cackling, mocking laughter filled the glade as their bodies melted away. It was if the earth beneath them slowly swallowed them, layer by layer, skin to muscle to bone to nothing and they never stopped laughing until nothing was left.
</p>
<p>
	At first it was the adrenaline crash and the fear that kept him silent and still... and then it wasn't. Every muscle in his body strained against some unseen force. The eyes in the woods... the frogs he had seen so far away, were here now, staring at him from beyond the edge of the glade. Unblinking, all-seeing, they stared. There were four of them at first, but slowly more eyes opened in the darkness, one by one, until the entire forest seemed to be filled with them.
</p>
<p>
	His flashlight, laying on the sodden earth next to him where it had dropped from his pocket, suddenly switched on. The eyes reflecting back to him in the woods were suddenly illuminated, too bright to see. He squinted as hard as he could against the light and when his retinas adjusted, his blood ran cold in his veins and his tears slid down his frozen cheeks like rain.
</p>
<p>
	There were no frogs in the forest staring at him. Each set of eyes that were set upon him, reflecting moonlight then flashlight, were the lifeless, glazed, dead eyes of hundreds upon hundreds of severed human heads. Each head hung from a tree branch, waving slowly but steadily, though their eyes never left him.
</p>
<p>
	The first four who had appeared, directly in front of him, poured blood from their necks, their skin far less pallid, their eyes not yet drained of life... Harvey. Greg. Emily. even Cowboy Bill who thank god was at least still wearing his Stetson.
</p>
<p>
	Each severed heads grotesque mouth then began to move in unison with the others, a gutteral, inhuman voice from both within them and without them, filling the woods and Mark's ear drums up to bursting "My lost love lies buried here... headless and blameless... and so shall he remain until the day this hatred is satiated.... for love... my dear..."
</p>
<p>
	The flashlight went out.
</p>
<p>
	Fingers, far too long, with far, far too many joints, slid into Mark's dim peripheral vision. He could barely feel them. There was a twist... and a yank... and Mark Steinbrenner never felt anything again.
</p>
<p>
	He never had a chance with Emily anyway. Oh and the team lost the Super Turbo Championship Edition Football Finals.
</p>
<p>
	The End
</p>
