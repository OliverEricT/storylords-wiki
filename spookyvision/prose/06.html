<p>
	Another town, another library, another library staff disgusted and stupefied at the mere sight of him - Pavlov Flinch was on a mission.
</p>
<p>
	For months now he was plagued by dreams. Not the kind of dreams he usually dreamt - with Benny Hill music and modest-by-today's-standards lingerie models running to and fro comically that we as an audience are supposed to assume he bangs, nor like those dreams where his dear old mom dies, leaves him the car, and he moves in with Flo from those Progressive Commercials then goes HAM on her like only he knows how, no... these were nightmares of unfathomable shape.
</p>
<p>
	He dreamed of murders, monsters, psychopaths and killers, eldritch abominations breaking through our paper thin reality and driving the entire world mad, of gurgling monstrocities for which there were no names - and all under a blood red moon.
</p>
<p>
	At first he had blamed his nightmares on years and years of undiagnosed mental illness, or maybe drinking uncontrollably at pretty much every waking moment, maybe even his mother's recent obsession with binge-watching Friends. God did he ever fucking hate David Schwimmer. No wonder that dude's career dried up the instant he wasn't on this godforsaken sitcom any longer. Suspension of disbelief is impossible when you have this human garbage bag sucking face with JENNIFER ANNISTON?! WHAT?! She wouldn't even fuck Flinch in his DREAMS, man!
</p>
<p>
	Still the nightmare's continued and he began to feel them seeping into his every day life. He could no longer loiter at the YMCA waiting to steal people's business casual clothing from their lockers like he used to. There was no joy in it left. He'd gone on a search, across the US... well from Jersey down a little ways, he's not MADE OUTTA MONEY y'know. Motel 8 ain't eight dollars anymore!
</p>
<p>
	He found himself perusing through the bookshelves upstairs in section G of the Cabbell County Public Library, in the heart of Huntington, West Virginia. The books were neat and all, probably full of words and shit, Flinch assumed, but that wasn't why he was here. He'd gotten a tip from a fortune teller woman who was appropriating the fuck out of one of those Eastern European peoples that it's still culturally acceptable to do that to - but she was dead on the money with that info.
</p>
<p>
	Here, sitting on shelf 16, row 8, was a small, leatherbound journal, slipped between two non-fiction books about West Virginian history. Flinch slid it out and drew his cheeto-dusty fingers across the once-clean cover lettering.
</p>
<p>
	"Journal of Kayla S. Hunter, Marshall University, 1999."
</p>
<p>
	He thumbed through it quickly, weighing in his mind whether he absolutely HAD to read or not. Most of the pages of the journal had been ripped out before one date, and after it. The journal was honestly only a dozen pages long maximum, with a bevy of blank pages at the end. He grunted to himself. Fuck... I guess he HAD to read. God damnit.
</p>
<p>
	He sat down criss-cross applesauce in the middle of the row and flipped to the first page with writing on it. And at a 3rd grade level, he began to readâ€¦
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	December 20th, 1999.
</p>
<p>
	I can't talk to anyone about this. Hell, nobody is going to believe me either way. It's been a week now and everything is back to normal like nothing ever happened and I can't live like this - pretending what happened didn't happen. The town of Buffalo Creek isn't just gone, it NEVER EXISTED. How in the hell does a town just stop existing?!
</p>
<p>
	Alright... let me get my bearings here. I think I'm going to tear this journal up and just leave this part. This is the only part that really matters. I need someone out there to know what I've been through and why I'm going down the path I am. I guess it'll be business as usual for everyone else, forever.
</p>
<p>
	My dad works as a conductor for CXO Railroads so he was overjoyed when I told him I was going to Marshall for an Engineering Degree. He was less thrilled when I asked him for a night shift job at the Buffalo Creek Rail Depot. It was just until I graduated and could get a real job and it was the only job I could think of where I wouldn't be robbed constantly working a night shift - big hello to 7-11 on 5th Avenue. Probably up to their 5th robbery this week as I write this.
</p>
<p>
	He was worried about me. Rail Depot's aren't really known to be the spot that young black college girls hang out safely most nights - I knew that as well as he did. But it would look damn good on a resume when I applied to any railway engineering jobs. Well... better than drink slinger at Pecker's Bar would anyway. Yes, that was a real bar in Huntington, WV you can look that shit up, I'm serious. They had a knockoff Woody Woodpecker for a mascot and it was super assaulty in there.
</p>
<p>
	Anyway
</p>
<p>
	I had been working there for 2 years at this point, and used most nights to work on my final engineering project proposal when I wasn't doing the quick rounds as per my security officer title. Even during those I mostly just kicked rocks around and listened to my cd player when it wasn't skipping every time I breathed the wrong way.
</p>
<p>
	Nothing interesting had happened in my entire two year stint as a security guard. I've caught three couples trying to bone in the brush at the back of the junction - one of them the star quarterback and the lead actor playing Romeo in the Huntington High production. He was drinking somebody elses poison that night. I think they're married now, which is more than I can say for most other railcar fornicators. I found a hatchet once and thought maybe there was a murderer about and my job was fun for about ten minutes 'til I called it in with my supervisor and he told me it was his. And it was for chopping WOOD like a BITCH. All in all it's the most boring job you could imagine. Or it was, anyway
</p>
<p>
	Around midnight on the 13th, I started hearing the sound of a distant train whistle. If you grew up in WV this isn't the most uncommon thing to hear in the night but there's always something a little haunting about it. The problem this time is I was sitting in the main office of the train depot where any train would be heading to - and not a single locomotive was due to come through until 6:14am. I sat there for quite a bit trying to figure out where that sound could have come from but eventually I bundled up and stood out on the glassed-in observation deck behind the hospitality desk to see if I could see anything in the distance.
</p>
<p>
	The instant I looked down toward the entrance gate at the side of the roundabout there was just... a train there already. Moving slowly toward the trainyard, lumbering slower than anything I had ever witnessed, to be honest with you. The fact that the two gigantic metal double gates to the tain yard were CLOSED made this amost like watching a disaster play out at half speed. But the train was barreling down at it, somehow I could tell it was going way faster than it looked.
</p>
<p>
	I ran inside the pavillion and grabbed the announcement intercom radio and started screaming into it at the top of my lungs " STOP! STOP! YOU'RE GONNA HIT THE FENCE! IT'S REINFORCED INTO THE CONCRETE UNDERNEATH IT! YOU'RE GONNA CRASH!"
</p>
<p>
	I hunkered down behind the desk, waiting on the sound of steel exploding and keeping my head down in case of shrapnel posthaste but... it never came. Just the sound of a train powering into the station roundabout, clicking onto a maintenance rail, and slowing to a dead stop at the end. I was more than a little confused, I would have described it as 'butt-fuckingly confused' in fact.
</p>
<p>
	I walked back out onto the observation deck and stared slackjawed down at the old gray steamer passenger train parked there spewing it's noxious smoke from undercarraige to steampipe. This thing looked like it had been ripped from a basement virgin's hands and the depths of his electric train set collection and just inflated up to life size. Don't fret, I'm sure the virgin has something else he's adept at to do with his hands in his grandma's basement all day - Nintendo 64 exists.
</p>
<p>
	I stood there dumbfounded for what felt like an age before I finally noticed that the passenger cars in this train.. weren't empty. As a matter of fact they were absolutely full to the brim. Inside were row after row of people standing packed shoulder to shoulder, unmoving even though the train had come to a full stop. I tried to crane my head around to peer out the windows but I just couldn't get a good look into the train car.
</p>
<p>
	I remembered protocol suddenly and somewhat shakily walked back into the front office and picked up the old peach colored dialtone phone from the desk and as quickly as I could dialed my supervisor's number.
</p>
<p>
	"What in the hell are you doing calling me at 1 in the morning, Kayla?! I'm tryin to do meth and watch Popeye cartoons in PEACE like any RESPECTABLE MEMBER OF SOCIETY?!" he yelled through the garble of the landline at me the instant he picked up.
</p>
<p>
	"A uh... a train just pulled in, Martin." I sputtered out.
</p>
<p>
	There was a long pause before he responsed with a resounding, screaming "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! I've barely rotted ANY of my teeth on this shit, I can't be too fucked up to understand yet!"
</p>
<p>
	I explained the situation from the beginning to him as best as I could muster into words. I've written hundreds of papers on complex mathematical and physics concepts but I have no clue how I explained it good enough for this drug addled divorcee to understand that night. He finally got it though, and told me to go ahead and call the cops in since it could be a stolen train. I was pretty fucking incredulous about this fact as the outlaw Jesse James hadn't been seen in these parts in at LEAST a fortnite, but I listened and did what I was told like a good employee.
</p>
<p>
	I dialed 911 and the phone rang exactly once before a soft click interrupted the tones. There was a moment of silence then that hurt my ear for some reason that I remember very clearly, and then another harsher click and a voice came on the line that seemed entirely out of place on an emergency line.
</p>
<p>
	"Hello." the voice said plainly, but politely.
</p>
<p>
	"Uh.... hello? Is this 911? I've got a kind of.. an emergency, I guess." I stammered a bit, unsure what the fuck was even going on.
</p>
<p>
	"And what's your emergency?" the voice said in an unbefitting chipper tone.
</p>
<p>
	"Uh.. I'm at the Buffalo Creek Train Depot and an unscheduled train has just pulled into the station carrying a load of passengers. We're not scheduled for another train until after 6am and it's a coal load train. ...as a matter of fact we only get two passenger trains a week through here for maintenance so it's all-around strange... My supervisor told me to call you because the train might be.." I choked on my words a bit here, realizing how fucking stupid this had to sound to anyone who wasn't 10 Popeye's deep smoking cleaning supplies in his underwear, "..stolen."
</p>
<p>
	"Ah, I see. Just sit tight, dear. I'll be there momentarily." And the line went dead. No dialtone, no hang-up sound, no nothing. Just dead silence.
</p>
<p>
	I stepped back onto the observation deck and stared out the window at the still-smoking but totally stationary train and it's passenger's below. The people inside looked almost like mannqueuins honestly. That's where my mind kept going - they aren't moving at all, they look so pallid and stiff, they were definitely just store dummies.
</p>
<p>
	I hapened to peek up at the sky for a moment to let out a heaving sigh when the clouds parted above me. I don't remember hearing or reading anything about it coming but there dangling lower than I'd ever seen, closer than I'd ever seen, was the moon -blood red and illuminating the entire clearing of the trainyard in scarlet light.
</p>
<p>
	KSSSSHHHHHHHHH....
</p>
<p>
	I snapped my head back down to the train below just as the doors finished opening along the sides of the passenger cars. From each one of them slowly walked multiple lines of people, in lock-step, shuffling from heel to heel like in a daze, like propelled by destination and not by desire whatsoever. I clapped my hand over my mouth to stop myself from reacting but I could see all of them clearly now... every one of them was wearing their sunday best in white but were covered in coal soot from head to toe, matted in their hair and in their clothing in thick poundage. Black, white, native, asian, they looked like were from everywhere but just looking at them you could tell exactly where they were from -- here. West Virginia. Nobody breathes the black lung air like we do.
</p>
<p>
	They filed out without any system, seemingly no destination, without a word or a glance between them. A few of them held hands as they walked but never looked at anything except the ground below them. Their heads hung and moved as a pendulum as they walked on. I was transfixed, I couldn't take my eyes away from them.
</p>
<p>
	DING DING DING
</p>
<p>
	The bell at the front of the hospitality desk pierced me through like a knife, shooting me upright and bringing me back to reality for a moment. But the instant that sound rung out in my ears, every single one of the shuffling soot-covered people below stopped dead in their tracks and snapped their heads up to look straight at me. Dozens upon dozens of pairs of sunken black eyes focused all upon me. I stumbled back away from the window and slammed into a folding chair, knocking it over with a metallic clatter. I turned my eyes away only for an instant to right myself but when I looked back out the window they were all back to shuffling away from the train cars, as if nothing had ever happened.
</p>
<p>
	DING DING
</p>
<p>
	I unsteadily made my way back out to the hospitality desk and found myself feeling a sinking, deeply uncomfortable feeling in my stomach that overwhelmed all sense of fear or apprehension I once had. The feeling is like when you've just gotten karate kicked in the gut by your younger brother after he finished that 42 hour kung fu movie marathon on TMC and you had been eating nothing but Taco Bell on a dare from your friend Alicia who was just trying to get you to fart in front of Tyree at the party tomorrow night because she was in love with him and knew you also had a crush on him and honestly Alicia's a backstabbing bitch anyway because she tongue-kissed Chad Thompkins and you called dibs on him at the Spring Fling last year anyway but she's such a fake bitty that she didn't even care about the pinky swear you made over Christmas Break. That kinda deep painful feeling.
</p>
<p>
	Standing in front of the desk was an unusually tall man, dressed completely in black finery, with his hands crossed behind his back. He looked somewhat official, with slicked back black hair and a heavy darned woolen black coat over slacks and loafers but the only pop of color on his entire being was a pair of round-rimmed sunglasses with bright red lenses. His skin was pallid white and he would. NOT. stop smiling. That kind of foney baloney corporate smile with absolutely no warmth behind it, that showed way too many teeth.
</p>
<p>
	"Hello Miss, you called 911 earlier about an emergency? How may I address you?" His voice really made me uncomfortable for some reason. Something about it seemed too deep for him. Or too... something I guess. It's hard to put into words, really.
</p>
<p>
	"Kayla Hunter. You don't look like a cop to me..." I was debating on calling 911 on him at this point. I don't really remember why I didn't.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh a Hunter, eh? Just like me." He chuckled a little to himself in a way absolutely no one likes. "Oh no... no." He spoke in such a chipper voice it would be almost impossible not to recognize him from the phone call earlier. This was the person I'd spoken too before, I would stake my reputation on it. "I'm a representative of The Silverbood Society. We are an organization of... like-minded samaritans who handle this sort of problem. The police wouldn't be much help for a..." He paused for a moment, rubbing his chin with his hand. I could see now he was wearing black woolen gloves as well. "...train robbery."
</p>
<p>
	"Oh uh..." By this point I was feeling kind of delirious. It must have been the adrenaline of the situation kind of draining out of me now that I was talking to someone or something but I couldn't focus on anything. I know now I should have called the cops, the real cops, even against my better judgement because fuck police and fuck everyone who likes their shrimpy-dicked floppy vaged bullshit, but I didn't even think about it then for some reason. I just couldn't FOCUS.
</p>
<p>
	"Never you mind. This kind of thing is sort of our speciality." He nodded to me and turned to walk away. Something about him walked out of the room kind of reminded me of one thing, though
</p>
<p>
	"Wait, you didn't tell me your name or anything... don't you wanna know what's going on, even?"
</p>
<p>
	"Oh, no, I'll be just fine taking care of it on my own. Please do me a favor and stay in here where it's safe. For both our sakes." And he was gone, out the door.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly I remembered how fucked this entire situation was, like a lightbulb had popped on in my brain finally, and I ran down the back stairs of the station, and out into the biting cold chill of the night. I barely even noticed the chill as I ran as fast as I could toward the train. It took me only a few moments of running across the tracks before I realized something that had eluded me as well - all of the people were gone.
</p>
<p>
	I frantically looked from side to side and couldn't see a single one of them any longer. I ran around to the front of the train depot, to the other side of the welcome station, all the way across the annex to the edge of the fence to the property. They were there alright, far beyond the fences, lumbering just as slowly through the woods, their white clothing - even covered in coal dust and soot, almost glowing in the darkness of the woods that surrounded the train yard. They were heading toward the town of Buffalo Creek, slowly but surely.
</p>
<p>
	I stood there at the fences edge for what felt like a lifetime trying to figure how they had climbed the fence so fast, gotten over the roll of barbed wire at the top, down to the other side, and continued on so unabated. It could've been minutes for all I know. I don't really know.
</p>
<p>
	Eventually I decided that I had to get onto that train and I had to find out who the fuck had conducted it into the train yard to begin with. I'd never seen the person get out of the engine, so for all I knew they were still in there. I set out at a sprint this time, the cold night's air burning in my lungs as I ran.
</p>
<p>
	When I made it to the engine car, I leapt the distance from the track to the step and latched my hand onto the guardrail in one motion - I don't think I could be that athletic for a billion dollars at this point but somehow I did. I swung around the open door and landed on the top step into the engine room and I can't even say I was surprised by what I saw at this point.
</p>
<p>
	Crumpled, by itself, in the middle of the standing area inside, was a large red and white robe with an extremely long pointed cap. I was at least thankful this motherfucker wasn't wearing a different color of this shit but it didn't set my nerves to any setting lower than EN FUEGO when I saw it. It was genuinely the most mundane part of the entire night so I decided to reserve judgement until I found the owner of it.
</p>
<p>
	I hopped down off the engine and landed in some leftover mud from last week's storm - just my luck, and my sneakers sunk into it way deeper than I'd imagined when I hit. Thankfully these were some shitty old BK Ratchtech or I would have shit a brick then and there and used it to bash the weirdo in black's head in myself.
</p>
<p>
	I wish I could describe this next part better but I honestly can't. Something leapt at me. Something HUGE from up above me, on top of the engine car, and sent me careening out of my sneakers and into the mud, head over heels, rolling to the edge of the gigantic puddle. I struggled as hard as I could to get back up to my feet, to get eyes on what it was, but something gigantic latched around my waist and flung me like a god damn rag doll through a fucking plate glass window directly into my supervisor Martin's office. I remember my back slamming into the edge of his desk, and rolling out into the floor.
</p>
<p>
	You couldn't even imagine the pain if you tried.
</p>
<p>
	I remember screaming at the top of my lungs, and clawing around on the floor for anything to protect myself with. I think I picked up a chunk of the glass I'd just passed through painfully and gripping it hard enough for my own blood to streak down it.
</p>
<p>
	There was this clicking sound outside, this warbling, clicking noise that I can't even describe but it was sickening to my ears. I could feel myself shaking every time it filtered into the room and I could feel my muscles tensing as it got closer... and closer... and
</p>
<p>
	BOOM!!
</p>
<p>
	The door flung open and Martin stepped through, wearing his uniform and a bathrobe for a jacket. His eyes darted around the room frantically, hands on his raggedy old gray head, screaming out.. at me. "WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO?! You've destroyed my office, holy shit!! You didn't get to..."
</p>
<p>
	He ran full sprint, overtop of me, past me, and yanked open one of the bottom drawers of his desk. He held up a 45 pistol in one hand and a gigantic glass jug of moonshine in the other and then began a-hootin' and a-hollerin' like only the horrific stereotypes of a people are capable. "PHEW! At least you didn't destroy my gun and muh hooch!" he squeeled.
</p>
<p>
	Something sharp and dripping soared pretty cleanly through his neck and out the other side, silencing him instantly. He dropped the jar of hooch on the floor as the thing sheered upward through the middle of his head and split in it half. I barely even registered his body hitting the linolieum behind me as I turned my eyes to the doorway.
</p>
<p>
	It felt like it filled up the entire room as it came through the door, like breathing out itself into my space. A swirling, faceless torrent of meat and bone encircling a vaguely humanoid form, shifting and undulating itself to move it reeled it's bladed appendage back into itself, gushing a small waterfall of thick blood onto the floor as the blade pierced back into the middle of it's constantly moving body.
</p>
<p>
	I don't remember if I screamed. I don't remember if I thought to run. I only remember grabbing Martin's stupid gun and squeezing off every single bullet in it directly into the middle of that thing. I may as well have been throwing cotton balls at it. It didn't flinch, it didn't make a move even, it just stood there - rivers of meat and sinew rolling over each other to form and reform a somewhat humanoid being before fragmenting and sluicing once more.
</p>
<p>
	When it did finally move I did scream. I remember thinking even in that seering white hot moment of primal fear that I didn't know I could scream that loud.
</p>
<p>
	It's midsection sprung in half for a moment and it stopped, bending forward as if it was caving in on itself, and then, I kid you not, a fucking SWORD, like a god damn fucking knight's sword from Excalibur and shit, sprung out of the place where it's stomach should have been, then caught fucking FIRE. And not just normal fire, but straight up blue and white fire that ate the thing from the inside out, burning it like napalm from core to where it's skin should have been.
</p>
<p>
	The thing burned away right in front of me, filling the room with a putrid stink I'd never experienced in my entire life, worse than any Taco Bell could produce.
</p>
<p>
	And standing behind it, holding the sword out in front of him like King fucking Arthur, was the man in all black from before, who smiled just as disengenuously at me as ever. He withdrew the sword, and stepped back, placing a case from his back onto the floor between us. I didn't even remember his carrying a case in to begin with. I sat there dumbfounded as he unclipped the case and opened it up, revealing a bunch of bubbling fucking green ooze inside of it. I'm talking like Nickelodeon gak over an open fucking fire - just bubbling and boiling like a god damn witches brew. And he dropped the whole sword into it, slapped it closed, snapped the latches, and slung it back over his back as if that wasn't the cherry on top of the wildest shit I'd ever seen sunday I'd just lived.
</p>
<p>
	He smiled as he handed me a business card I shakily took, barely even registering what I was doing.
</p>
<p>
	"Look me up sometime if you're interested in this type of thing. Usuaully people don't survive."
</p>
<p>
	I don't even remember watching him leave. I just looked down at the black business card he'd just handed me and squinted to make out the gold lettering on it. "Indrid Cold."
</p>
<p>
	I came back a couple days later to pick up my shit after I quit. Martin was there, alive and well. He talked like Martin, smelled like Martin, dressed like Martin. But it wasn't him. His office looked immaculate, even his jar of hooch was in the bottom drawer. Not a speck of blood anywhere.
</p>
<p>
	I watched the news to see if anything ever happened to the town of Buffalo Creek once all those people made it through the woods to get there. Nothing ever came up. I tried to Yahoo search and you know what I found? There is no town on Buffalo Creek. There never has been. Now tell me why in the fuck there had been one there MY ENTIRE LIFE before that night? No one remembers it even fucking existing. My friend Valerie is FROM THERE and she thinks I'm nuts every time I mention it. Says she lives ON Buffalo Creek, there is no town there.
</p>
<p>
	So I write this and leave it here in hopes that someone like minded will find it. Someone corageous enough to follow me down the rabbit hole and find out what the fuck is going on out there at night, under the full red moon. Someone with the wit and the stomach to deal with what I've dealt with. If that's you, look me up in the Marshall University directory. I'm sure I'll have more info than this by then.
</p>
<p>
	Cause I'm going out there alone for now. And I'm going to find out what this "Silverblood Society" actually is.

</p>
<p>
	Pavlov Flinch closed the small leather journal and tucked it into his overcoat surreptitiously. He turned to walk away but stopped, turning back and snatching a book called "Human Sexuality & Taboos" off the adjacent shelf, shoving it deep within his overcoat as well. You ever wonder how the fuck they just put shit in there in movies? The pockets inside those kinda coats are usually pretty small but people be putting fuckin' TVs in there and shit, what's up with that?
</p>
<p>
	Anyway
</p>
<p>
	Flinch walked out the double doors of the front of the Cabbell County public library and stood there on the street corner in the early evening air. The smell of mediocre ass spaghetti that's been around long enough for people in this town to all agree to pretend it's good for some reason permeated the air from Jim's Spaghetti down the street, and the sound of ballet class muffled through basement studio windows filtered out over the sounds of traffic and conversations on the street level. Some jackoff on a mountain bike wearing full Live Strong regalia holds up traffic for a half a mile behind him because he refuses to use the bike lane. People enjoy a nice pepperoni roll in this trying time. This is Huntington.
</p>
<p>
	Flinch turned his eyes down the long street toward the rising buildings in the distance, flagged by large posts that had green flags fluttering in the wind, even visible from this distance.
</p>
<p>
	Marshall University.
</p>
<p>
	He shoved a whole week-old donut directly into his gullet, smearing the pink frosting over the side of his mouth. Then he started walking.
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
