The Twilight Between Waking & Sleep

Prompts: Draculas & Clowns

By Jeff Pennington


“FFFUUUUUUUUCCCCKKKKK!” screamed Pavlov Flinch, holding his hand over his mouth to stop himself from retching. The car he was bitch seated in was skidding like Dom Toretto outside of Josh Henderson’s bedroom window when he’s recording a podcast - straight around the corner of an old dirt road onto an even shittier dirt road adjacent to it.


“Somebody shut him up, now!” Alyssa Medero screamed from the driver's seat, her white-knuckle grip on the steering wheel being the only thing keeping everyone inside the car alive. 


“With pleasure.” Kayla S. Hunter muttered, taking a handkerchief out of her pocket and using it as a barrier between her skin and his - as she always did anytime she was forced to interact with him - to press his hand harder into his mouth and muffle his pathetic screaming.


“You’re taking this surprisingly well, Dev.” Jason said to Dev from over the seat between them, before catching sight of the sickly pallor over his little friends features. “Oh… shit, dude, are you gonna…?”


“It isn’t a matter of if, it’s a matter of WHEN…” Dev said gravely.


“LET’S HURRY THE FUCK UP!” Jason screamed.


“SHUT UP, EVERYBODY SHUT THE FUCK UP, THIS ISN’T 50CC ON MARIO KART YOU KNOW!” Alyssa screamed back in return, yanking the steering wheel onto yet another dark, empty back road to follow the dimly glowing glint of red tail lights in the distance they had been unable to catch up to for seemingly endless miles now.


But after an hour or more of chasing, the distance between them started to shrink rapidly. Just past the treeline ahead of them, the RV they had been chasing screeched to a halt, its tail lights instantly dimming and the darkness and distance making it hard to tell what was going on ahead of them any longer.


“Wait, wait, wait, they stopped!” Jason yelled out, pointing out the front window.


Alyssa jolted on the brakes, causing everyone in the car to violently lurch forward against their seatbelts, the wind getting knocked out of four sets of lungs at once. Flinch on the other hand was sent flying directly into the front seat into a disgusting human ball like a shaved Sonic the Hedgehog wedged in the drivers cab. He let out a loud yelping scream and then unfurled as best he could, his legs draped over the shoulders of Alyssa and Dev.


“Get OFF of me, you piss-stained garden gnome!” Alyssa growled out, shoving Flinch back towards the back seat. 


Dev leaned heavily against the door and window on his side, his face basically melting off his features in pure nausea and disgust.


“I got him, you just drive!” Jason called out, reaching up and grasping onto the back of Flinch’s jacket and yanking him back into the backseat like a grown adult pulling a toddler back from running at an amusement park. 


Flinch hit the seat and smiled his weak half-busted smile, “Oooh, strong boy.”


“What is your DEAL, man?” Jason screamed out in frustration.


“It’s nice this isn’t just happening to me, for once.” Kayla said offhand.


Alyssa shut the lights off and slowly lurched the vehicle forward into the darkness. She squinted to try and catch sight of anything in front of her, but the underlights of the car could only illuminate a few feet in front of them as she went.


But it wouldn’t be too long before they broke the treeline as well, and were instantly hit with a beautiful sweeping vista completely lit in blues and deep purples by the full moon which hung low in the sky above them. Sweeping fields and trees dotted the landscape in every direction before them but dominating the landscape was a gigantic old style gothic manor, complete with high steeples and towering buttresses along its side.


“Oh god… it’s Dracula’s Castle…” Dev spoke in a hushed, reverent tone under his breath. “I didn’t even bring a camera! How am I ever gonna prove to the guys online I met Dracula IRL?”


“Draculas don’t show up on film, dingus.” Alyssa said absently, her eyes scanning the dark shadow in front of the mansion for any sign of the RV as they approached.


“Isn’t that just because film used to contain silver? Like the whole not showing up in a mirror thing?” Kayla retorted, rubbing her chin as she did.


“I would have brought a digital camera, I’m not an amatuer at this.” Dev scoffed.


“An amatuer at taking photographs of Dracula?” Alyssa asked.


“I’ve taken a few photos of goths in my day.” Flinch said to pretty much no one.


“I’m getting out of the fucking car.” Jason announced, unsnaking his seat belt from around his midsection and then throwing the door open. 


Alyssa slowed the car to a stop as Jason hopped out into the night and began to creep toward the front of the massive manor house. He kept low to the ground and squinted into the darkness to make out the shapes within the inky blackness.


The others followed suit, one by one - though one had to be pushed out into the darkness to get him to follow. Each of them pressing on into the darkness with only the vague outline of their compatriot directly in front of them to guide them.


—-------------------------------------------------------------------------

“I don’t understand…” TK said softly, her voice a million miles away from her - lost in a deafening hum of halogen light bulbs and static electricity.


“You have been alone for a very long time.” the cold, calculating voice returned to her. The electrically cracking monotone of the flickering faceless being that called itself Nil. “I will rectify that. Your mind, what it is capable of, will serve the Gestalt. The perfect being. We will become a part of it, together.”


“What…?” TK struggled to maintain a grip on herself, her grip like a sieve, the sand of her very being falling through her fingers into the nothingess of the endless whiteness. “I don’t… I want to be me…”


“Come now, Teresa. When has that ever been true…?” the voice cooly retorted, filling up the space where her self used to be. “You were raised by foster parents who feared you. Surrounded by people who instinctively pushed you away. Who knew the horror you could unleash instinctively even if they had no true concept of it. Even Alyssa…”


“No…! She and I we’re… we’re gonna…” TK felt it slipping. She couldn’t see anything any longer, couldn’t taste the iron oxide sizzling in the air around her anymore.


“Whoa, this place is mondo freaky, dudes and robo-dudes!” a voice broke the monotony instantly, shattering the whiteness around them into fragmented walls with black depths between them once more. TK was standing in the middle of the room, whole again, facing down the flickering glitch ghost before her, but they weren’t alone.


Floating beside of her with his incorporeal hand placed on her shoulder was pretty obviously Dips, I mean you fuckin’ heard what he said, who could it have possibly been otherwise? That cool ass cartoon dog Poochy from Itchy & Scratchy? He’s not even in these stories, dumdum, keep up.


“What is the meaning of this…?” Nil said in a sparking, glitching tone that seemed almost emotional for a moment.


“Dips!” TK cried out, feeling a sense of relief in herself she had never experienced before in her life.

“THE one and only Dipsinator, baby! I’m here to totally pull a Luke and Obi-Wan on you, partner! Let’s get outta this wild hallucination, ok?” Dips smiled a bright wide smile, sliding his sunglasses down his nose as he pointed at her with the fingerguns.


“Pointless.” Nil spoke in a reverberating tone which seemed to come from everywhere at once. He held out a jittering flashing arm toward Dips and instantaneously the ghost began to glitch and jitter in the same manner, sending him into violent convulsions.


Dips tried to scream but couldn’t, the sudden shock of feeling pain for the first time in almost 30 years overwhelming him to the point of bleariness. He shook and shuddered and mouthed screams but no sound came from anything he could accomplish in his writhing agony.


“WHAT NO!! DIPS!!” TK screamed out, taking a step forward but stopping instantly, having no clue what to do to help. A feeling of panic, of helplessness, of fear overwhelmed her, caused her to completely freeze up, and tears welled in her eyes. The sound of the humming halogen bulbs began to grow louder once again.


But TK gripped her fingers together into fists tightly then, and the tears at the edge of her eyes began to vaporize in the suddenly growing heat.

—----------------------------------------------------


“BOOM, BITCH!” The gigantic oaken double doors of the Arklay Mansion exploded open as Jason’s boot caught just the perfect angle in the middle of them to splinter the wood and send them dangling off their ancient brass hinges from the force of his kick. The light inside the mansion was dim, but modern, and sudden, so it still caused the entire crew to recoil away for a moment as their eyes adjusted.


“SO neato!” Dev cried out in response.


“Well they definitely know we’re here…” Kayla muttered, shaking her head.


Alyssa just looked at Jason with judgemental eyes. 


“...what?” Jason finally broke the silence. Then a moment later “WHAT?”


Alyssa walked past him, shaking her head as well. Without a word she dipped her hand into the back waistband of her jeans and returned with a 9mm pistol, which she quickly primed for firing and aimed around the room.


“Holy cow, she’s got a piece!” Dev cried out in shock.


“God damn.” Kayla said, with a little too much of a tone of being impressed in her voice.


“What exactly do you do for a god damn living, Alyssa?” Jason asked, incredulously.


“I’m a florist.” Alyssa said without cracking even the slightest smile.


“Ok, I actually like this one.” Kayla said with a devilish grin crossing her lips.


“Me too.” Flinch said, creepily. Everyone else in the room groaned in disgust at once.


But this actually turned out to be pretty damn fortuitous for our heroes since one of the people in the room at the time who this disgusting wretch of a mole man made groan was actually Miller, the Gestalt Chrysalid from back in Whitesville, who was standing at the top of the stairs at the other end of the foyer.


“YOU!” Jason screamed out, teeth gritted tightly. 


“Yes, yes, ME. What if that, your fucking catch phrase, Bart Simpson? What’s next “I Didn’t Do it”? “Eat My Shorts, Gestalt?” Please.” Miller said with vitriol in her voice.


“The threat this season seems a lot less serious than last season did…” Kayla remarked to no one in particular.


“Who the hell is this now? I don’t even know this one.” Miller gestured with both hands at Kayla. Kayla opened her mouth to speak and Miller did the ‘zip it’ hand gesture at her instantly. “I don’t care. I will never care.”


“Well that’s just generally bad manners…” Dev muttered. 


Alyssa pointed her gun up at Miller and squeezed off two shots pretty instantly. The first shot went through her shoulder, causing her to stumble a step back, and the second pierced directly through her forehead, causing her entire body to lurch backwards from the force.


“God DAMN!” Kayla yelled out.


“Wow, my heart is definitely in arrhythmia now!” Flinch yelled out too. “It’s unrelated though.”


But Miller’s body lurched forward suddenly, and exploded open from the middle outward, splitting in half like a cocoon falling away as her full Chrysalid form emerged from inside of it into the air, unfurling it’s massive wings which filled up the gigantic foyer from one wall to the other. She floated into the middle of the room and cackled a loud, high pitched, buzzing cackle which caused everyone to recoil at once.


“Oh god, I think it stopped beating…!” Flinch yelled.


“KILL THEM, BURRMANS!” Miller screeched out, pointing down into the foyer with a long, clawed finger.


Emerging from the dark on either side of the room underneath the stairs were Bud and Luanne Burrman, their eyes faded white and pupil-less, their teeth seemingly sharpened into fangs. They sprung toward the gathered group near the door, screeching an inhuman and violent scream.


“Don’t hurt them, they’re under mind–” Dev managed to get out before Alyssa turned her pistol toward Bud and blew a hole directly into the middle of his skull, causing him to lurch backward and then fall limply into the hardwood floor beneath their feet.


At the same moment, Kayla unsheathed her cane sword and swung it into a wide arc, the blade sluicing almost imperceptibly through Luanne’s neck. She posed with her arm outstretched and her blade glinting in the low lights for a moment before Luanne’s head slid from her shoulders, bounced on the floor once, and then her body crashed to the floor heavily.


“...control…” Dev finished, with slumped shoulders.


“Two less boomers.” Jason said with a shrug. Everyone nodded in silent agreement. Even Dev.


“ENOUGH!!” Miller spread her arms out, her eyes flashing a brighter, lit up red which burned with hatred and virulence. The room began to spin, coalesce, and fall in on itself, each of her assembled foes losing their balance and falling into the yawning void she had created below them.


All was suddenly black for a moment.


When the light had returned to their eyes, Jason, Dev, Alyssa, Kayla, and Flinch were all standing in the middle of a gigantic dirt ring. They squinted their eyes into the bright blinding lights high above them, through the darkness at the edge of their vision, and saw row after row of bleacher seating. Large tentpoles raising up into the void above them, more rings of dirt edged by red and white banding reaching out into the nothingness beyond them, a deep red tint at the farthest edge of their periphery. 


“Is this a fucking circus…?” Jason asked incredulously.


“Doesn’t Miller trap you in one of your worst nightmares usually?” Dev asked with the same bewilderment in his voice. “I used to LOVE to go to the circus when I was a kid! Before I found out about how they crucify the elephants if they don’t paint good.”


“Until you found out WHAT?” Kayla yelled.


Just then, from the darkness around them, gigantic red eyes began to slowly sift into reality, bobbing back and forth in long steady motion. The group all stood ready for a horror to leap at them from beyond their sight, each of them ready to meet their greatest fear.


But what shuffled out of the darkness was just a fairly tall clown dressed like a stereotypical 1920’s era train-riding hobo, complete with bindle and stick. He grinned wickedly from cheek to cheek and reached a gloved hand up to honk at his big red nose as he stared them down. From the other side of the room a much more stereotypical Bozo-style clown in a big yellow and red polka-dot fat suit slid from the shadows, juggling big red balls in the air as he never broke eye contact with everyone in the group at once somehow.


“...Clowns? Who’s afraid of clowns? They’re jolly and funny and always bring the most illegal drugs and fireworks you could ever want into town.” Flinch broke the silence, but then quickly added, “Or so I hear, unless you’ve got money on you.”


“Seriously, what the fuck is going on?” Jason asked.


“Well I think Miller’s power is somewhat limited. Remember what Alyssa said about how she and TK had the same nightmare when under her power last but it wasn’t anything she’d ever personally been afraid of?” Dev explained, dweebously.


“Yeah, it was like a corporate hellscape kinda nightmare. I never worked that kinda job, but TK did once and she hated it more than I personally hate this guy now.” Alyssa shoved her thumb at Flinch.


“That’s fair.” Flinch returned.


“I hypothesize that she can only prey on one fear at a time and has to tailor her illusions based on the fear of only one person, no matter how many people she’s trapped inside. That’s why Jason saw his brother in our shared hallucination.” Dev said, shoving his glasses up his nose like a Revenge of the Nerds character minus the blatant sexual assault.


“So who’s fear is this? Who’s afraid of a fucking circus clown?” Jason asked, looking around at each of his compatriots.


“Not me.” Kayla said in a practiced monotone, her eyes wandering around in the darkness above them idly. “That’s a real kiddie thing to be afraid of. Real bitch made kinda shit, you know? Couldn’t be me.”


Everyone in the group took turn looking at each other, except for Flinch who was staring off into the middle distance with his eyes completely unfocused, not a single thought in his brain.


“It’s ok to be afraid of things, Ms. Hunter.” Dev said brightly. “But hey, these guys don’t seem very dangerous, so there’s that!”


Everyone turned to look at the clowns in the moment, who drew their hands back up out of the darkness to revealed hundreds of bloody, dripping blades, chainsaws, axes, pikes and jagged straight razors exploding out of the ends of their arms - their heads elongating upwards to reveal row after row of serrated, bloody teeth which began to whir around in a circle like their were a motorized garbage disposal, but human sized.


“AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!” every single one of them began to scream at once.


But just as quickly as reality had changed before at Miller’s behest, they were all shunted violently back to reality all at once, slamming into the hardwood floor of the foyer at the Arklay Mansion.


“FUCK!” Jason screamed as he hit.


They all turned their eyes back up to the top of the steps, and each of them felt a sudden pulse-pounding shock at what they were greeted with.


Miller twitched. Well, one half of her did. The other slowly fell to the floor with a loud, wet schlorp, flopping in its own purple juices for a moment before finally sitting still. The other half followed suit more slowly, doing no flopping once it hit the floor this time.


Standing where she had once stood was a man in a black overcoat, tattered and busted it still fit him perfectly and accented his wavy black hair along the way. He turned his dark, deeply underlined eyes down to the assembled group, withdrawing his right arm from the air which slowly seemed to shrink down and regrow a layer of human meat and flesh overtop of it, returning it to its normal shape and size. He unrolled the sleeve of his coat down over it and shoved the newly formed hand back into his pocket.


“RYO?!” Kayla screamed out, her eyes wide and her jaw dropped. “What the fuck?!”


“Oh yeah, I did know who that guy is…huh…” Flinch said to no one, yet again, because no one ever wanted to acknowledge he was there.


“You know this murdering scumbag?!” Jason gritted his teeth in frustration. “I thought I fucking killed you, Tachibana? Dropping fucking heavy machinery on you isn’t enough?!”


“I don’t have time for either of you.” Ryo said flatly. “One of you left me for dead and the other one actually tried to dead me. You can hold hands and fuck yourselves together for all I care. I’m here to destroy Gestalt, once and for all.”


“Whoa, whoa, whoa!” Dev cried out, running to get in between Ryo and the others with his arms outstretched to the sides. “This guy just saved our lives! And he’s done it before, for all of us! Let’s take a second to cool down and actually discuss whats going on here!”


“We don’t have TIME for that!” Alyssa yelled out, picking her pistol up off the floor and making certain it still had ammunition in the clip. “TK is in here somewhere and god knows what they’re turning her into or doing to her. I don’t give a SHIT about any of your stupid vendettas, I was my girlfriend back and I’m going to GET her back!”


“I’ll help you.” Ryo said flatly once more, then nodded to her with silent assurance of his words after.


“Yeah… yeah. That’s what we’re here for. We’ll find your girl and shut this secret society shit down. Then we’ll have a LONG conversation about what happened in Whitesville last year, Ryo.” Kayla said with a deep frown on her face. As far as she knew, Ryo had abandoned them in their eleventh hour and left them to face a horrorshow alone. She knew nothing of what had happened to him since.


“Man…. FUCK IT. We’re gonna find TK and I’m gonna get my fucking revenge, finally. That’s what this is about, THAT is why I’m here.” Jason glared at Ryo, who said nothing to him in return.


“Well I’m personally gonna go ahead and head out…” Flinch said, turning with a wave over his shoulder and walking back towards the door.


“Wh… you’re leaving?” Dev said with shock in his voice.


Everyone stood in silence and watched as Flinch walked out the door in complete silence, save for the sound of the Nintendo DS startup ding and the telltale opening music from Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga dissipating into the night outside.


“And nothing of value was lost.” Kayla said flatly.


Bwoooosshhh! 


Everyone turned to the strange sound effect behind them in time to see a translucent blue figure be fired straight through the wall without harming it at all and land in the center of the foyer in the fetal position with a near-inaudible thud.


“Dips!” Dev cried out, running towards him at once, along with Jason and Alyssa. Kayla stood transfixed at the ghost boy - the literal first ghost she had ever seen in her life - that everyone else seemed to already know about?


BOOOOOOMMM!!


The double doors at the top of the stairs exploded open, sending wood and brass shrapnel flying in every direction. All of the living members of the story dropped to the ground instantly around Dips’ coiled up body, avoiding the brunt of the detritus that was flying around like bullets in the air.


Slowly floating across the threshold, three feet in the air, with her short black hair coiling around her face and her eyes completely blotted out with inky darkness, was TK Kanzaki - the focus of their little rescue mission, surrounded by wavering, blistering energy.


“TK!!” Alyssa cried out, stumbling up to her feet to try to run to be with her - but just as quickly as she had lurched up, Jason grasped onto her wrist to stop her in her tracks.


“WAIT! She was possessed before, remember?!” Jason growled out, hauling himself to his feet alongside her. “She could blow us apart with a thought, you can’t just run up and expect hugs and kisses to fix this!”


“How the hell do you dispossess a psychic? I’m not as well-versed in fucking GHOSTS being real as the rest of you.” Kayla spat out vitriolically. 


“I-I don’t know…! This is way outside my field of expertise! I’m more of a Frog Men and Braxton County Monsters kinda guy!” Dev cried out.


“No one knows what that FUCKING MEANS.” Jason screamed in return.


“Wait, dudes! DUDES!” Dips shot up in the middle of the crowd, throwing his hands up in the air as he floated above them. “She’s totally simpatico, bros! That’s her in her noggin, not the freako monster guy anymore!”


Everyone turned from Dips back to TK and watched as she slowly floated down the steps and both of her chunky boots touched down on the antique carpet at the bottom of them. She dropped her arms to her sides, the blackness draining out of her eyes, and her body slumping forward slightly.


“TK!” Alyssa yelled out once more.


TK raised her head slowly, and blinked an absent blink at the group assembled before her. A moment passed, but a small, weak smile crept across her features. “Hey guys… long time no see.”


“YESS!!” Jason cried out, as he, Alyssa, Dev, and Dips all crowded around TK and grabbed onto her at her shoulders and arms, smiling brightly and laughing as they all embraced together.


“TK I thought I’d lost you…” Alyssa whispered in her ear. TK just smiled and got up on her tippy toes to press her forehead to Alyssa’s.


“That couldn’t happen in a million years.” TK whispered back.


“Yo this group hug is BOSS, dudes!” Dips yelled out.


“Alright, I hate to break up this Handjobs Across America shit you guys are on but we’re still inside a fucked up evil mansion. Can we get the hell out of here yet?” Kayla said impatiently.


“No.” TK said plainly. “There’s someone….something… in charge of all of this. Every time I’ve been mind-fucked by anything lately, even myself, I end up in this white room with this glitching digital ghost. I thought it was an illusion, like maybe Miller was doing it or something, but I know it isn’t now.”


She turned to look up the stairs into the room she had been standing it. It was a long white hallway with railings along each wall that seemed to stretch so far into the distance as to be impossible. The door at its other end was barely a dot in their vision.


“I can feel it. The thing that’s caused all of this. The white room. It’s beyond that door.” TK said with narrowed eyes and a balled fist at her side.


“TK, this thing took over your mind and made you come here, you can’t be serious.” Alyssa aid with shock in her wavering voice.


“Well I’m with her and I’m dead fucking serious. This thing is the reason Archie is dead, and I’m going to fucking kill it myself. I ain’t leavin’ until Gestalt is fucking gone for good.” Jason growled out, hefting his silver-tipped fireman’s axe up and laying its blunt haft against his shoulder.


“I guess I’m in the business of stopping apocalypses so I’m not leaving either.” Kayla said with a shrug of her shoulders.


“What about you?” Alyssa said with a glance over to Dev.


“Are you kidding? Guys like me DREAM about getting into scenarios like this! All I gotta do now is prove aliens are real and get a match that isn’t catfishing me on Tinder and I’m set for LIFE!” Dev said with a wide grin.


Alyssa smirked ruefully and shook her head. “I’m not letting you all get killed. I’ll stay too. And besides… we took my car.”


“Well alright, dudes and dudettes! We’re gonna be REAL AMERICAN HEROES bros, just like Hulk Hogan, my dudes!” Dips cried out happily, throwing his hands up in the air in celebration.


“uhhh...anyone wanna tell him about what Hulk Hogan is known for nowadays or…?” Kayla whispered to the group.
