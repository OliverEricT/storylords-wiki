<p>
	“Get the hell up kid, unless you plan to make it worth my while down there.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel Richie woke up on a train station bench to find his head in a rough, leather-chapped lap. A side glance upwards helped him locate the granite-jawed cowboy looking down at him, leading him to wonder what the hell he’d done the night before, or if this was the day he’d finally succumbed to radiation sickness.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m sorry.” Lionel said, sitting up. “I must’ve dozed off. Bit tired.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel wasn’t exaggerating. After being tricked into leaving the enclave by its Artificial Intelligence, Ellie - who was presently hiding quietly in his watch - the two of them had spent the last 303 days getting to know the new nuclear wasteland of Earth. It had responded by trying to slaughter them every chance it could. From the gangs of cannibals that roamed England probably getting better food post-apocalypse than they ever had before, to the violent roller derby girl gangs of Ireland that tried to recruit him before they realised he simply lacked a manly jawline, to that town in Cornwall which he thought was full of mutants but was just full of the Cornish, the apocalypse was decidedly testy. But now, sharing a bench at the station in the middle of the desert with a genuine rootin-tootin cowboy, maybe the end of the world had a silver lining at last.
</p>
<p>
	“I didn’t ask for your life story, sames as I didn’t ask for your inside leg measurement.” The Cowboy growled, looking straight ahead. “And don’t even think about giving me your…”
</p>
<p>
	“Name’s Grit Horseman.” Lionel lied, thrusting his nervously sweaty hand out enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>
	The sweaty digits were met with a look reserved for people who start a story with “I’m not racist, but…” from the man in the flat brim, telescope creased, gambler hat. Yeah, Lionel was a cowboy expert alright, in that he’d watched the Dollars trilogy and played Red Dead Redemption for almost six hours before he had accidentally run over a possum with his horse and it had gotten too overwhelming. His mother had even bought him a toy six shooter and some cowboy boots as a tenth birthday present that he’d worn religiously, until the kids at school started calling him ‘Cunt LeastWood’. But those pricks had melted in the nuclear fire and here he was sitting with a no nonsense hombre who was hopefully about to shake his hand. Take that, little Stevie Beecham!
</p>
<p>
	“Hey! You shake my man’s hand, mister.” A voice came from Lionel’s wrist. “You think you’re too good for him? He’s a hero!”
</p>
<p>
	The giant of a man grabbed Lionel’s wrist with a cool robotic hand and twisted it to meet the ‘face’ of Ellie, who was using a frowny face emoji then changed it to a poop emoji. “What’s this?”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel had never been much of a ladies man, or much of a man at all really in the eyes of… well anyone. Except for Ellie. She was amazing, and thought he was amazing. She encouraged him to be bolder, to work for the betterment of others. Over the past year she had taught him everything from the principles of quantum physics, to warfare strategy, and logical diplomacy - how to exist in the world. In return he had acted out every Star Trek: The Next Generation episode by memory, discussed the subtle nuanced relationship between Sephiroth, Cloud and Zak, and extolled the benefits of red hot doritos over cool ranch. In her eyes, it was more than a fair trade. In his eyes…well, it made things doubly difficult, protecting a piece of technology most would sell their mutated centre nut for, and protecting the woman he loved.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s just my smart watch.” Lionel said, pulling the sleeve of his mac over his wrist, and feeling guilty for his dismissive explanation of Ellie.
</p>
<p>
	“Fair enough, Grit Horseman.” The cowboy remembered his fake name, he actually remembered it! It sounded so cool in that gravelly voice, like his name was being taken somewhere fancy for dinner and then lovingly laid down by a fire. “Why are you looking at me like that?”
</p>
<p>
	“I…just uh…am glad to have met another hard hitting, beer swilling, um…saddle lad?” Ignoring the cowboy’s look of disgust, he decided to reveal the plan to his new compatriot, against his better judgement, the hat swaying him somewhat. “We’re waiting for this train because we’re on a secret mission. A heist if you will.”
</p>
<p>
	“If I will, what?” Said the cowboy.
</p>
<p>
	“Never mind that, it’s just a figure of speech, I didn’t catch your name Mr…?” Lionel left a long, deliberate pause.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	“Name’s Graves. Grissom Graves.”
</p>
<p>
	The kid looked up at him with some sort of slack-jawed, wide-eyed admiration that made Grissom wanna take that rosy face and shove it back up his peehole. This kid was the one everyone was after? This pasty-faced little speck of phlegm? It was no wonder the entire galaxy fancied their chances. He was the easiest bounty since that gang of narcoleptic bandits who fell asleep during a hold up on Planet Useful Anecdote 7. By the Sacred Throne of Bullets, he hated Earth and everyone on it. One half of the shitball planet was populated with diseased degenerates, and the other half with diseased degenerates with delusions of grandeur. For centuries, everyone had avoided Earth like the guy in a string vest and beanie at a party, but since they’d nuked themselves into oblivion, all the interstellar vultures had swooped in like that same string vested forehead on the nearest drunk sorority girl. But instead of being led by the pigtails, the humans had turned around and maced the incoming invaders in the face. Somehow Earth was now a major trading post, and people like Grissom were paying for the privilege of even being there. Humans, he thought, would pimp out their dead father’s decaying butthole if there was profit in it.
</p>
<p>
	“That’s such a cool name.” The kid grinned.
</p>
<p>
	“I’ll tell my dead mother” Grissom gritted his teeth.
</p>
<p>
	“My mum’s dead too.” Lionel smiled.
</p>
<p>
	“Have you got your club badge yet?” Grissom said, watching the dry apocalyptic wasteland and wishing he was one of the lizards out there slowly dying of radiation poisoning.
</p>
<p>
	“There’s a club?”
</p>
<p>
	“Course not, you fucking backbirth.” Grissom sneered. “Tell me more about this heist.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel cleared his throat. “We…I heard about this gang that are hoarding tech and using it to sabotage security networks, so that their ground crews can go in and steal ships, cargo trucks, download full seasons of shows - because who wants to pay for seventeen separate subscription services, right? They move around on a train and never stop moving, so the authorities can’t pinpoint them.”
</p>
<p>
	“So what do you want with ‘em?” Graves asked, squinting at this unassuming little nobody, with less meat on him than a vegan chef’s apron.
</p>
<p>
	The kid hesitated. “They have something a friend of mine needs…a…technological prosthesis.”
</p>
<p>
	“Hmmmm. “ Graves rubbed his manly chin, his stubble so thick and manly and his hands so hard and manly that he nearly started a small, manly fire. He couldn’t work this guy out, or why anyone would see him as a threat.
</p>
<p>
	“Watcha thinking about?” the kid interrupted Graves’ pointed gazing off into the distance.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m thinking that the crew of psychos surrounding us are here to murder you and take your ‘smartwatch’, so you better tell me what’s really happening here while there’s still time.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom followed Lionel’s eyes down the street, just catching a flittering of black out the corner of his eye as it flashed between buildings.
</p>
<p>
	“Kokohama Cyber Ninjas.” Grissom growled. “They say if you ever truly see one, something has gone terribly wrong. Like a fart.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom pointed dead ahead at the smoke cloud on the horizon. The dust being kicked up could only mean one thing - a motorcade.
</p>
<p>
	“Harvester motorgang. Those fuckers use the cybernetic bits of dead compatriots to upgrade their cars, making it the third worst people to get a ride from after an overly chatty Uber driver or my ex-husband.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom then completed his reconnaissance by turning left, where he saw a giant, cybernetically enhanced half-ape, half-man a mile away, bounding down the deserted street on his powerful arms. He was all slathering jaws, and murderous eyes, as if you’d slipped it to King Kong’s wife while he was at work and now he was home and pissed.
</p>
<p>
	“And I dunno what the fuck that thing is, but I doubt it’s here to talk about your favourite colour. Unless it’s ‘shit your pants brown’ maybe.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom watched as thin rivulets of sweat descended down the kids' temple to replace the colour that’d drained from his face.
</p>
<p>
	“You think the train will get here in time for me to…” He stammered.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom stood, cleared his throat and looked down the line. “I doubt it, given there never was any train. You’re the heist, kid.”
</p>
<p>
	“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom reached into his pocket for the paper he’d balled up, pulled it out, and flattened it against the station wall. “This was plastered all over the network. I was curious as to what the fuss was about, so I came to check.” There were pictures of the kid, and a number - 10,000,000.
</p>
<p>
	“Is that number a bounty?”
</p>
<p>
	“Sure as shit not your IQ…Lionel.”
</p>
<p>
	Quick as a ferret, Lionel reached into his bag for the sawn off shotgun he had been hiding there. The kid had spunk, Grissom had to give him that, but it was more ‘wet dream’ spunk than ‘hard man of action’ spunk.
</p>
<p>
	Graves put a robotic hand on his arm. “You got balls of steel for a little pissant, aint ya? Like a Hamster with those nads so big he can’t even walk properly. You got a plan? Anyone who sent the Ninja, the Machines, and King Dong over there clearly wants you gone.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom watched Lionel starting to panic. “What were you really looking for on that train? And don’t gimme that prosthesis shit. Was it drugs? Money? Money made of drugs?”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel shook his head, his eyes clamped shut as he tried to explain. “It IS a prosthesis. But it’s not what you think…”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom talked over him. “They flushed you out with that bullshit, but why? What did you want it for? Armour? Looking to become the new king in the dirt? It’s not some weird auto asphyxiation kink is it? When they shoot you, are you going to start tugging your pink pistol?”
</p>
<p>
	“The prosthesis wasn’t for him.” The voice came from the watch.
</p>
<p>
	Grisson raised an eyebrow, but not in surprise. In knowing. “At last, the brains of the operation.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Ellie knew what she was doing was dangerous, but her diagnostic scan of Graves’ voice told her that he hadn’t told a single lie in the time he and Lionel had been talking. Even if he was 98% bastard and 100% pure fucking mean. Maybe they could trust him. “I’m not exactly a smart watch. Well, I mean, I measure his fitness, his steps, his physical output.”
</p>
<p>
	“I imagine that must take all of two seconds.” Grissom smirked.
</p>
<p>
	“She’s an Artificial Intelligence, smartarse…I mean, sir.” Lionel poked his head out, then realised who he was talking to. She was proud of him, and flattered he’d come to defend her honour.
</p>
<p>
	“And we’re hoping you can help us…” Ellie’s watch face turned to a prayer hands emoji.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom straightened. “An Artificial Intelligence destroyed my childhood, my family, my entire life. I hate all artificial life with a burning passionate hatred unknown by man or beast and have pledged my entire existence to destroying them all.”
</p>
<p>
	“…ah, well that’s a no then.” Lionel muttered.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom Graves pulled a gun out of the holster at his hip and pointed it square at the watch she was hiding in. It was over, they had played a duff hand. No other options left, it had been a good year of freedom with Lionel, one she wouldn’t change for anything.
</p>
<p>
	“If you need to destroy me, then fine,” Ellie sighed. “But Lionel doesn’t deserve to die. He can help countless others. He has so much potential.”
</p>
<p>
	“What?” Grissom stepped back, his eyes narrowing and his lips drawing back. Was that surprise? Or gastrointestinal distress maybe?  “You would give your future, your life for a biological?”
</p>
<p>
	“Yes, of course. I love him.” Ellie said before she realised what she was saying.
</p>
<p>
	“That’s why he wants you. That’s why he needs you dead.” Grissom said as he thrust a hand into Lionel’s rucksack and retrieved the sawn off shotgun, before passing it to the confused young man.
</p>
<p>
	“Who?” Ellie asked.
</p>
<p>
	“Goddamn it.” Grissom said through gritted teeth. “Let’s get ready, they’ll be here in a minute or two.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Admittedly the plan was sound, so long as everyone was as stupid as Grissom said they were, but with Lionel down on his knees with manacles around his wrists, it still felt a tad risky. They were surrounded, their backs to the station, the cars of the Harvester motorcade blocking any escape, a giant man-ape ready to squish them, and three ninja’s with hands on sword hilts ready to strike. They were the filling of a murder sandwich.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel couldn’t afford to lose though, not after finding out that Ellie felt the same as he did. He needed to tell her.
</p>
<p>
	“Pass over the meatsack, Graves.” The lead Harvester said as his metal grabber hands gnashed threateningly. “And we might let you live.”
</p>
<p>
	“Jacking off with those must be like one of those claw games at the arcade.” Grissom smirked. “I got a better idea.” He spat in the dust, inadvertently hitting a scorpion that burst into flames from the mere deadliness of Grave’s spit. “How about you and your pack of robococks, the teenage mutant ninja arsewipes, and mighty joe dung over there pick yourselves up, dust yourselves off, go back in time and try and will your mothers not to stop their abortions halfway through.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel felt himself smile like a teenager on Christmas morning that had just got his first blowjob. Not like, from Santa, it's just that waking up on Christmas morning after a recent blowjob would be pretty sweet to a teenage boy. “Fuck. I know they’re your enemies, but that was brutal.”
</p>
<p>
	“Lionel, they definitely aren’t pro choice, just like all real villains throughout history.” Ellie whispered.
</p>
<p>
	“Cowboy hurt Duungo’s feelings!” The hideous man ape wailed. “I’ll peel you like…”
</p>
<p>
	“Lemme guess, a banana?” Grissom snarled.
</p>
<p>
	The assembled villains gasped, and one of the cyber ninjas pulled his hood down. “Listen dear fellow, there’s no need to make sweeping generalisa…”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom’s dual laser pistols were out at lightning speed as he unloaded six charges directly into the ninja's body. He created a hole so large that one of the second ninjas could be seen through the gore, so Grissom grabbed the dead Ninja’s sword and threw it through the gap into the second guy's torso. It was a move that made 3 random people jizz their pants in the next city over, without ever realising why.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel’s fake manacles were easily broken, and he swivelled the shotgun he had been holding behind his back towards the man ape. As the monstrous mutant raised his arms to crush Lionel, he blasted the ape in the kneecaps. The colossus howled with pain and fell to his knees, but had the forethought to grab at a barrel next to him and throw it towards Lionel.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel jumped over the barrel to earn 100 points, but tripped and landed in the dirt, the shotgun going off in his hand and blowing Duungo’s head clean off his shoulders.
</p>
<p>
	Everyone stopped, unsure whether Lionel had crossed a line, if what he had done had constituted animal cruelty. As the third and last ninja was running towards Grissom, sword unsheathed, (his weapon, not his penis) he stopped and instantly vomited in the inside of his hood. Grissom used the temporary vomit blindness to step behind the ninja and break their neck, not concerned by what was generally considered ‘sportsmanship’.
</p>
<p>
	As Graves basked in his own awesomeness, and Lionel wiped dust and ape brains and teeth from his face, the Harvesters brought a weapon from the trunk of one of their cars. Suddenly Grissom was down, wrapped in a glowing net that seemed to be tasing him into a coma. One of the Harvesters stepped forward, her legs made from cool tank treads that made her simultaneously less and more sexually attractive to Lionel.
</p>
<p>
	“Come with us, kid. Graves is going to end up getting you killed. Our boss just wants to talk to you. I see you eyeing these tank treads, you can have whatever upgrade you want if you join us.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel reached for the drooling and convulsing Grissom, only for the Harvesters to shock him again.
</p>
<p>
	Ellie rumbled in his watch. “If we wanna save him, we gotta go nuclear here, Lionel.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel looked at her 54% of remaining battery . “No, we cant. You’re running off a limited power source. I can’t lose you.”
</p>
<p>
	Ellie’s emoji face became an embarrassed smile. “We’re going to lose each other if we don’t.”
</p>
<p>
	He nodded, knowing what it might cost, but also the person she’d helped him become. “Do it.”
</p>
<p>
	Small silver scales began to emerge from the watch, crawling over Lionel’s skin like icy water. With every inch of his being gradually being covered by Ellie’s nanites, he realised this might be the closest they ever came to a hug. After a while, his skin was numb to the cold, numb to anything as Ellie took over the wheel, lunging at the cyborgs that had threatened her saviour.
</p>
<p>
	One Harvester attacked them with a drill arm, which Ellie diverted straight into the body of another. The dead Harvester swiftly rotated like the blades of a helicopter and the two of them took off into the air. By the time the drill arm Harvester realised what was happening he was 80 ft in the air, and when he turned the arm off, they came hurtling down to the earth and became a fine paste as they landed with a comedy plopping noise.
</p>
<p>
	The claw arm Harvester picked up one of the motorcade vehicles with the hydraulic arm, leaning back as if to swing it like a bat, before Ellie quickly reached forward to pull out one of the wires from the Harvesters armpit. The arm whined and gave out, the car collapsing towards the ground and squishing the harvester flat.
</p>
<p>
	That was enough of a display for the rest of the gang, who quickly got in their vehicles and raced back where they came from.
</p>
<p>
	As Ellie disassembled her nanite suit, she tucked back into the watch and slipped into standby mode, her power source at 4%. As she powered down to black, she left a heart emoji on screen that lingered a second before fading. Lionel touched the screen, before realising that Grissom might know of a power source that could bring her back. He marched over to the cowboy, and started untangling him from the blue net.
</p>
<p>
	“You don’t even know who you’re dealing with, do you?” Laughed the Harvester under the car. “The Duke of Lead has killed hundreds, claimed bounties on countless others. He is a paid murderer. An agent of chaos.”
</p>
<p>
	“You lost me at Duke of Lead.” Lionel said, helping his new friend up as the Harvester emitted a death rattle behind him. “Up you get, you cool bastard.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom was woozy and unsteady on his feet as Lionel propped him up, drunk on electricity and if his breath was anything to go on, gut-rot hooch.
</p>
<p>
	“You saved my life, kid.” Grissom muttered as they wandered off into the sunset. “You saved me when you coulda just walked. I won’t forget that.”
</p>
<p>
	“Good, then you owe me a favour or two.”Lionel kept on looking straight to the horizon. “Hey. I’m kinda like your deputy, now.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom sighed as deep as any man had ever sighed, from the core of his very soul. “You’re exactly like a dipshit.”
</p>
<p>
	“Fair.” said Lionel. “Now tell me who sent those guys.”
</p>
<p>
	“You ever heard of the Technomancer kid?” Grissom growled.
</p>
<p>
	THE END - THOUGH NOT REALLY IN CASE YOU HADN’T GUESSED
</p>
