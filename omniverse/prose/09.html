Chapter Nine - Trouble or Nothing

They say in space no one can hear you scream, but as the ship did another 9G turn and Lionel pitched a screeching fucking fit in the seat next to him, Grissom Graves thought that particular idiom was as useful as a no-dicked bull in a studding competition. The Conveyance of Grissom Graves - named such as Grissom felt there was no need for frou-frou imagery when picking a name for his dope spaceship -  flew between two asteroids, then activated dual tractor beams to grab them and slam them together at one of the pursuing Harvester ships. As it flattened the pilot popped out of the top of the ship like toothpaste out of a tube. Seeing the opportunity to kill another Harvester scrub, Grissom turned the ship back into the fray.

“Danger. Danger.” The computer warned. “Harvester ships in weapons range.”

“You’re not going back into that mess are you?!” Lionel pleaded. “We barely got out by the seat of our definitely not urine-soaked pants.”

Grissom grabbed the computer’s speaker and ripped it out, coating them both in a shower of sparks. “I don’t take instructions from any machine, not even my alarm clock!”

“And that is why breakfast is always ruined!” Lionel put one hand on his hip and straightened out the ‘Kiss the Cook’ apron he wore that Grissom had corrected with a sharpie to say ‘Kick the Cook’s Ass’. “Yet still you complain!”

The ship arced back and cut the floating pilot in half with a wing, spraying blood all over the view screen. “And if you think I’m cleaning that, you’ve got another thing coming!” Lionel pouted.

Grissom banked right suddenly to avoid a volley of Harvester fire and to smack Lionel’s head against the sensor controls at the side of the cockpit. He exclaimed in pain, and Grissom chuckled. The kid was a pain in the ass tantamount to ruptured haemorrhoids, but the Lead Duke needed the Artificial Intelligence inside his watch, it might just have been the only thing that could kill the technological twat that had laid waste to his whole planet. But Ellie was on standby mode until they could find some sort of compatible power source for her, having sacrificed the last of her battery power saving him and Lionel from an ambush of dickheads back on Earth. She was next to useless for now. The boy, by comparison to the glorified paperweight attached to his wrist, was somehow even more useless.

A barrage of lasers hit the ship, alarms ringing out as the vessel rocked from side, which accidentally activated the ships date night protocol. Marvin Gaye started blaring from the intercom and the lights changed to a cool mood lighting. “Status report!” Grissom ordered as Lionel rushed to the panel to get a damage readout. He turned and grimaced to Graves.

“What?!” The bounty hunter growled. “How bad is it?”

“The damage-readout machine has been destroyed!” Replied Lionel.

“Where’s the nearest inhabited system?”

Because the navcon was also broken, Lionel pulled an A-Z (Alpha Centuri - Zeta 9) from the shelf and flattened out one of the maps. As he thumbed the index, then slowly unfolded a map onto the control panel, the ship rocked back and forth as it was hit again and again. The map rolled back into a scroll, and Lionel sighed deeply and slowly rolled the map out once more.

Before Grissom succumbed to the urge to kill his dawdling compatriot, he switched to long range sensors, then long long range, then the “only with a full tank of gas” sensors, but there was nothing there.

“Looks like this is it, Lionel.” Grissom said, wondering what they’d put on his gravestone, secretly hoping it was just a picture of a middle finger. “Time to go down in a blaze of glory.”

“Wait!” Lionel screamed in a pitch so high Grissom was worried he’d caught his ball hair in the airlock. “ What’s this?” He pointed on the map to an odd, dark blue splodge in the shape of a whale.

“Kalandra.” Grissom muttered. “We don’t wanna go there kid, trust me.”

“We don’t have a choice, Grissom. If you’re serious about restoring Ellie and getting back at that Technowizard guy you hate so much, do we have a choice? Or would you rather be blown up? Don’t answer that, it was rhetorical.”

After giving Lionel a hard stare that would’ve made most men run home and crawl back up into their mothers’ front butts, only to get an equally hard stare back, he punched in the coordinates for the whale and hit the slip drive.

If there was a place where hell seeped from the butthole of the universe, threatening to peel your skin off and shout racist, homophobic, or sexist obscenities in your ear while you tried to die peacefully - well, it was probably New Jersey - but the Geldon Shroud was a close second.

The giant space whale - or geldon if you were in the know - floated there, dead and rotting. Nobody knew how it had died, some say it’d been part of some great space war, some say it’d died of a broken heart when its mate had died, and some said that the only way to a true democracy is the dismantling of the entire capitalist machine. The point is, no one knew how the geldon died, but they knew that the placcid, space faring beast was full of valuable substances, and the crimelords that had settled there had made a spaceport to exploit those promises. There were the geldon bones, which could be mined for material stronger than tritanium, or the congealed digestive serums that were more valuable than gold pressed diamonds in the shape of a sweet booty. Disgusted? Well, google ‘ambergris’ before you come at me, and once you realise that everyone who wears aftershave or perfume has been spraying sperm whale bile all over their necks, then we can talk, ok?

The Conveyance docked in one of the recharge stations in a Geldon Tooth, and as Lionel and Grissom disembarked, the bounty hunter leaned in to side talk to the human. “Listen, the Geldon Vale is a dangerous place, I want you to stick to me like glue and say no-thing to no-body, you hear me?”

He turned, but Lionel was nowhere to be seen. A quick scan of the area revealed that Lionel was talking to a scorpion tailed merchant who was trying to get him to sign a contract. Grissom marched over, punched the bug man straight in the face and pulled Lionel over to the main concourse. “Just what the hell do you think you were doing?”

“That nice bug said he liked my face, and wanted to make me famous.”

Grissom closed his eyes and sighed, before bending down to get in Lionel’s face. “That was a Vorcho, they make clothes from humanoid skins. You would’ve made the most famous coat in all the Vale. Stick with me, and I’ll keep you from trouble.”

As they turned back towards their target, seven burly looking security officers stood with guns pointed at them.

“Grissom Graves.” a modulated voice said. “You and your charge are to come to see our manager.”

“Yeah, well you tell your boss they can come get me themselves if they want me, whoever it might be.” His fingers grazed the phase pistols, and the guard gritted his teeth.

“Kalandra wants to see you.” He said in a robotic voice.

******

Lionel and Grissom were marched through a casino, past the craps tables, the trademark old ladies at the slot machines, and the sweaty smell of desperation and cigarillo smoke often associated with these places.

Feeling as if this was possibly the most depressing location to spend your last moments, even for someone who had spent the last few years in an underground conclave in the midst of an irradiated wasteland, Lionel looked down at his watch, hoping and praying that Ellie would give him some encouragement, but the face was black. Before long, they came to the back offices of the casino, and a giant, wooden, carved door that someone was obviously overcompensating with.

“Wait here.” The guard held Lionel at the shoulder and halted his progression. “The boss only wants to see Mr Graves.”

Graves gave him the nod, and the ensemble went in, leaving Lionel to a bench outside. He sat down and spent a few seconds planning how he was going to give Grissom the pouting of a lifetime for not demanding he be allowed to come too, when he noticed a server emerging from a small service hatch running parallel with the main office. He ducked in before the door could close, and shimmied down the walkway until he came level with the air conditioning vents at the far end.

“Grissom Graves, it’s been a long time.” A voice as slick as a honey covered ferret came from the neighbouring room.

******

“Not long enough.” Grissom tipped the brim of his hat, part in respect and part to still feel the small, concealed pistol buried in the inside of the band.

“Checking for your gun?” She asked, a smirk on her face at his visible annoyance at being found out. “I may not be a Duke of Lead anymore, but I still remember all the old tricks. Did you think you could sneak in and out of the Vale without me noticing? I run this whole place now.”

Kalandra was as beautiful as he remembered, and even though it had been thirty years, he still felt a tug - in heart and pants - at the sight of her. She wore a dark blue dress, coupled with a formal jacket that still bore the crest of her duchy - a Gresson hawk with her family’s guns in place of the wings. Her long, purple hair was tied into a long series of braids that were wound together at the bottom, much the same style as Grissom’s mother wore the day she died.  “I didn’t even think of you at all, Kalandra.”

She smiled, and Grissom couldn’t help but want to kiss those full lips again - or murder her. It was a complex emotion he couldn’t quite get his head around. “I see you have a new little sidekick following you around, Grissom.”

“He’s not a sidekick.” Grissom had to lie, if she suspected how important he and Ellie were to Grissom, she might take them. “He’s just baggage. Kid is useless as a dick on an incel.” Huh, he realised, the kid did mean something to him. Something arose in him that he was proud of - he had feelings! He thought they had been buried after the destruction of his world, and then dug up and burned when that guy at the armoury had got his name wrong and said “Bullets for Kissom Graves!” in front of a whole shop full of people and they had all laughed at him. That had almost been worse than his homeworld dying - he didn’t wake up in the night with a cold sweat over the planet, but that armourer?

A big sulking harumph noise came from the side vent, and Grissom shook his head as Kalandra’s smirk grew even wider. She gestured to her security and they left the room to retrieve the idiot. “You never were a good liar. Will this one die as horribly as the last? Do what I did, Grissom - give up. There are no Duchies left, our people have been scattered amongst the seven sectors. Ondar flew to the edge of space, now he’s mad and thinks he’s king of the space hamsters. Fincher lost an arm to the Harvesters and is a hermit, Denarius hasn’t made contact in over ten years. We’re going extinct, Grissom. The Technomancer won. He murdered everyone we loved, my father, your mother, Emme..”

“Don’t speak his name.” Grissom almost growled. He wasn’t looking to talk of Emmeth, he couldn’t.

Two guards dragged Lionel back through the door, squirming and trying to kick the much larger men. “Let me go, you bullies. I have an attendance certificate belt in a karate taster I got at the mall, you know?”

Kalandra laughed. “The waif amuses me, as does your obvious affection for him. Tell me what you want, relic.”

“Ship repair.” Grissom hesitated, trying to appear indifferent. This next item might be a stretch, play his hand. And he had a hand of twos. Like the number two, he hadn’t shat in his own hand just to be clear. “And a regenerative power source of about 70 zetagels.”

Kalandra raised an eyebrow in shock. “That would be enough power for a whole city, or a colony ship, or…” There was that silky smile again. “Oh you. You’ve found a weapon, haven’t you? Going off to start your little war again, eh?”

“Don’t see how that’s any of your concern.” Grissom stared her dead in the eye. How far had she gone? How far strayed from the path, merely a step? Or was the path but a distant speck in her rear view now? “Can you do it or not?”

“Oh, I can.” She moved from behind her desk and perched on the edge, arching her back so that Grissom would get distracted by her body. He drank it all in, but gritted his teeth. No man nor woman had ever distracted him from a mission, even that mission to kill that cult leader who had surrounded himself with those nude supermodel followers. Had he been tempted? Of course. Had he let himself be crowned as their new leader and had every one of them every day and night for what felt like eternity, learning new pleasures every minute of every day? Undoubtedly. But had he completed his mission first? You’re damn straight he had. “But here, you play for such a prize. This is a casino, Grissom. The bigger the prize, the bigger the stakes. Give them the list of suitable games.”

A security officer passed them a small list and Grissom beckoned Lionel over to read with him. The kid was being pissy for some reason, but he had no time for it. “I’ve never played a game in my entire life, have you?”

Lionel tutted, affronted. “Come on, does ‘roll for initiative’ mean anything to you?”

“It means I’m filled with the desire to sock you in the jaw.” Grissom pushed the list into his hand. “Pick one.”

Lionel scanned the list. “Death Wheel sounds like it might be a bit…’deathy’. And slot machines have really low odds of winning, unless they’re different here?’ He asked Kalandra.

“If by different you mean 0.7% chance of success and lethal kicks to the groin to those that fail?” Kaladra said, bored and picking lint from her dress.

“No to slots, then.” Lionel shook his head, ticking off the options. “No to plague bait, no to lung pull, no to castration hold’em.”

“Definite no to castration hold’em.” Agreed Grissom. “What about that one?”

“Go Fish? I know that one!” He walked with the list to Kalandra’s desk and slammed it down, pointing feverishly. “We’ll play Go Fish.”

Kalandra waved a hand. “Take him away to prepare.”

At that, the security forces grabbed Lionel under the arms, much to both he and Grissom’s surprise. “What the hell are you doing, Kalandra?” Grissom growled.

“I didn’t say who would be competing now, did I?” She stared as Lionel was taken away. “Go with him if you want, maybe you can give him a pep talk, or at least find out his burial arrangements.”

******

“Look, Grissom, it’s just a game of Go Fish, I used to beat my cousin at it all the time. Admittedly, there was a bit of cheating, and he was dropped on his head three times as a baby, but it’s not a tough game.” Lionel jogged on the spot, still mad at Grissom for his dismissal of him. It wasn’t a new sensation, to feel underestimated, underappreciated. He was the least favourite child growing up, his father not putting pictures he’d drawn on the fridge in case his other siblings drew better ones, even though he was an only child! But he’d saved Grissom’s life, been flying with him for a few months now. To be dismissed so completely was just cruel.

“Kalandra is a casino running crimelord, Lionel.” Grissom rubbed his goateed chin and looked deep in thought, or constipated, it was really hard to tell with Graves. “There’s no way this’ll be easy for you.”

Lionel gritted his teeth, and turned to face him in this dressing room they had placed him in to prepare. “And I’m such a loser, I couldn’t possibly win this on my own?”

“Glad we’re on the same page.” Grissom was looking out at a giant arena housed in the Geldon’s rib cage that was filling up with people, all seated around a central pool of liquid fifty metres in diameter. What the hell were they doing?

“Fuck you, you pompous, hat wearing, saddle sore.” Lionel said before he realised what he was saying. “I know you don’t ride a horse, so that last one was redundant, but fuck you, you cowboy wannabe.”

Grissom turned, as furious as Lionel had ever seen him. “What’d you say to me, little man?”

“You heard, Clint Queefwood.” Lionel couldn’t back down, wouldn’t back down. “Get out of here. I don’t need your help, I can win a game of cards on my own.”

Grissom strode to face him, Lionel’s eyes coming just barely to the Duke of Lead’s chest. What would he do if Grissom tried to fight him? He could nipple cripple him maybe?

“You’re going to die. And when you’re gone, I’ll pluck that computer off your wrist and use it to kill that chrome-skulled cock ring without a second thought for you or her. You’re a boy, Emmeth, playing at…” Grissom’s face paled, and he shook his head, as if to banish whatever memory had taken him. Lionel went to touch Grissom’s arm, to ask him what was wrong, but Graves barged past him and up the stairs, leaving him alone in the dark.

The blood pounded in Lionel’s ears so loudly that he didn’t hear the attendant coming down the stairs to pass him the equipment required for the challenge. As he passed a shocked Lionel a sharpened trident and polished shield, Lionel could only ask. “I’m sorry, just what are the rules of this game?”

******

“Why, he has to fight a Krellan, of course.” Kalandra said matter of factly from her seat in the corporate box next to Grissom, both of them overlooking the geldon bone arena. He felt her eyes on him and tried to stay neutral, but his jaw clenched uncontrollably as he watched Lionel try and fail to lift the shield higher than waist height, then nearly stab himself in the groin with a trident.

“A Krellan seems overkill, doesn’t it?” Grissom muttered as nonchalantly as he could muster. He had taken down a Krellan as part of the Lead Trials, on the path to getting his guns. It had nearly killed him with its ferocity.

Kalandra watched him like a hawk, not interested in the fight even as the gongs started sounding for battle and the crowd cheered in swelling anticipation. “You care for this boy. He’s not just cannon fodder for you.”

“So what if I do? He’s going to die soon. You beat me, just like you wanted.”

Lionel was currently doing some half assed stretching, pulling a leg behind him and giving up after a second of discomfort.

“You really are a fool, my love.” Kalandra put a hand to Grissom’s. “I don’t want you beaten, I want you to give this up and live. Finally live.”

The gongs and cheering fell silent, it had begun.

*****

Lionel stood on a rickety platform that swayed in the ebb and flow of the water and tried not to think of the bilious feeling in his belly. He had only been on a boat once, when his dad had tried to get him to come fishing in order to make him a man - whatever that had meant. After puking four times, including on the single fish his dad had been able to catch that day, they had driven home in silence. Top tier parenting as always, dad.

Lionel suddenly realised that the arena had fallen silent. Thank god he had stretched. He readied his giant fishing fork thing, and waited. A deep gurgling and bubbling came from beneath the surface in front of the platform, a churning of water just off the…what was that part called? The bow? He tried to remember his Star Trek. Yes, the bow. Thank you, Mr Data. A small tentacle flopped onto the raft, scrabbling for purchase. Lionel watched the poor thing climb pathetically up onto the wooden platform, and then went to pick it up to make sure it was ok. As he held it in his hands, he got up close to watch its tiny cute eyes blink in unison. “You alright there, little fella?”

Thick, fibrous tentacles burst from the little creature and wrapped themselves around Lionel’s waist. As he dropped the creature to the platform with a plop, it shook and burst its outer skin, inflating out and growing. By the time Lionel realised what had happened, the thing was twenty feet tall, its mawlike mouth as gaping and wide as the holes in JK Rowling’s terf arguments, and as unnecessarily violent as your average police routine stop and search. As it lifted Lionel into the air, he wondered if this would be the end.

******

“I mean I want you to give up this war and live a life, you cretin.” Kalandra smiled, as genuine as when they were kids. So she was still in there, the girl who’d taught him how to hone his trigger finger…and how to shoot guns, too.

Grissom was vaguely aware of a screaming, and thought he may have seen a tentacle drift by, but he was too preoccupied with their discussion. “I appreciate what you’re trying to do, Kali, I do. But I can’t let this lie. If it takes my dying breath to kill him, I’ll do it.”

Kalandra sighed, as the crowd gasped in horror. “We’re not to blame. If we had’ve been there, we’d have died too.”

The crowd emitted a collective “Ooh” as Lionel was thrown through the air. Grissom bowed his head. “We were slacking off, the nine of us were off playing when we should’ve been fighting. We were deserters.”

“We were kids. All of us. Just like your soon to be dead friend out there. If your mother’s consort hadn't gotten us off world we would have died alongside everyone we ever knew.” Lionel screamed as Kalandra went on. “So, you chose the continuation of your mission as your prize from me. Want to change your mind?”

Grissom looked deep into Kalandra’s eyes as Lionel screamed for Grissom, but he couldn’t hear the kid. A few rows forward, two audience members vomited, and a baby cried at Lionel’s plight. “What do you want in exchange for his life? Just ask.”

“I want you to forgive yourself for what happened to Emmeth.”

Grissom swallowed hard, but didn’t cry, because crying was weakness, and weakness was for birds, the weak birds. “He was a kid, he tried to follow me on this quest for revenge and I turned him away. And he went his own way anyway. It got him killed.”

“It was his choice, and it looks like you’ve got a second chance. Don’t waste it.” Kalandra gestured for her guard, then looked out into the arena, where the Krellan opened its mouth and lunged towards Lionel. “Guard, bring him i…oh, good lord.”

*****

Lionel jolted up in bed, only for the wound at his shoulder to force him to slow down and come slowly to a sitting position. He rubbed the bandages and winced as the injury stung him, then found his shirt and gingerly pulled it around him.

A voice came from the dark corner of the room, it was Grissom. “Turns out the Krellan feeds on emotions, namely bravery. When it bit into you, you were so toxic to it, it spat you out and died of cowardice poisoning right there on the platform. They’re calling you The Yellow King, they’re having a parade for you right now.”

“Really?” Lionel lit up.

“Nah, we had to move you to a secret location so they didn’t riot and kill you.” Grissom was no good at this stuff. “I just wanted you to feel better. You ready to go?”

Lionel hopped off the bed carefully. “What about the power source?”

“Kalandra called it quits at the ship repairs. We’ll get Ellie fixed up somewhere else Lionel, don’t worry.”

The walk to the docking tooth was brief, and as they entered the ship and closed the airlock, Lionel sighed for what was probably the fiftieth time since they’d left his hospital bed. The Duke of Lead didn’t want to add one more burden to his shoulders today, but he didn’t want this fucking sulk hanging in the air like a bad smell. “Ok, spit it out. What has your panties up your crack?”

“I heard you, you prick. Calling me useless baggage.” There was water in his eyes, but Grissom gave him kudos for not being one of those ‘single-tear’ people. “You think that because you have five inches over me in height, and probably length, and that you can shoot a gun with your chiselled arms, that you’re somehow braver than me, somehow more equipped for this mission.”

“You coming on to me, Lionel?” Graves furrowed his brow, he wasn’t good at subtext.

“Let me tell you something, mister. I’d crawl over broken glass, over your dead body to get Ellie back for a minute to tell her I loved her. And however far you think you’ll go to complete this mission, I’ll go one inch further.” Lionel poked a finger at Grave’s chest, only for him to look down at the finger and run his tongue across his teeth, causing Lionel to instantly retract it. “Sorry. Don’t punch me.”

“I can’t apologise, I don’t have it in me. But I will tell you I had a brother once. He was a monumental pain in my ass every single second of every single goddamned day. I’d crawl over glass to have him back too.” Grissom remembered Kalandra’s words, each syllable still stinging his soul. He pulled a small silver pistol in a holster from his hat band and gave it to Lionel, who looked at him with such reverence Grissom saw Emmeth’s eyes staring back at him for a second. “If we’re serious about this mission, I’ll have to teach you to use his gun.”

“Will you tell me about your brother?” Lionel asked.

“If we get the right narrative prompts.” Grissom nodded.

Lionel took the gun out of the holster and immediately shot a hole in the ship, which nearly triggered a catastrophic hull breach. Luckily, they were able to plug the hole, and Lionel was given a pricing gun to practise with until he was ready. He only priced himself four times that first day.

THE END
