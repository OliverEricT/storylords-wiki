Episode 15:  To Thine Own Self Be A Giant, Angry Crocodile.


Prompts: Religion and Bazooka


By Rich Masters



Asher dodged the throng of people like your dad dodged the responsibility of raising you, and moved through the marketplace, trying not to stab anyone as she was jostled back and forth by the idiot townsfolk of the Velitean colony going about their usual, mundane little existences. All of her senses were assailed by the place and its inhabitants, but the scents of the market were intoxicating. The smell of exotic spices, filleted fish and meats, syrupy pastries, and the lavender lotions floating off the oiled, cut bodies of the sexworkers who were showing more flesh than the butchers market stalls. You notice how a lot of these stories have started out with mentions of sexatoriums and massage parlours? Never say I don’t cater to my audience, you freaky little sex perverts.


“Care to have your worries stroked away, my lovely?” One of the lithe men called to Asher as he hung out of the open doorway, and simultaneously hung out of his small speedo. “You can come spend some time in my hands.”


“She’d have to sit on your face, Mallin, your nose is longer than that cashew nut you call a penis.” Purred a woman in clothes so transparent it was like she was wearing the ghost of clothes. “She looks like she needs a few curves pressed against her. Or maybe she needs the services of our benefactor’s deft touch? Your worries will be gone or your entire money back.”


In truth, Asher was more in need of a frontbutt boogie partner than your mum after she’d been kicked out of her book club for returning her Mills and Boons novels with all the pages stuck together. My god, Liz, just go out and get your man on, couple of drinks and the gin smell will mask the scent of your pathetic loneliness and desperation. I know Bob left, but that was 10 years ago, and he was a waster anyway. Go rent How Stella Got Her Groove Back and pull yourself together, you still got some good years left in you, girl, don’t waste them thinking you’re not desirable. In fact, you don’t need no damn man! You’re a wonderful human being and I don’t care what they’ve been scribbling on the public bathrooms about you having herpes so bad that sex with you is like dipping a dustbunny into sulphuric acid. You’re you, and that should be enough.


Wait, where the hell was I? Oh yeah, Asher could do with some sex. She’d been on Velit for the last four months, keeping her head down (not because she was giving head, because we all know from the sexually charged last paragraph she wasn’t getting any) and trying to keep out of the way of history. But god, she was hornier than a triceratops, eating a cream horn whilst learning the french horn who also happened to have a raging boner.


She took both the sex workers’ hands and let herself be led into the building with a sigh. She was just so tired and so alone, and if she didn’t get fucked soon she might drown this whole city in a splooshnami. She was led into a room of soft curtains and strong pillars - and the decor was nice too - HEY OH. But seriously, it was like a old world hareem in here, to be clear just in an aesthetic way and not in the keeping sex slaves way which is not cool, and I’ll go out on a limb and and say this is a Storylords endorsed opinion - especially now Greg’s not here this week.


The woman stood at the doorway as she directed Asher to the bed and dimmed the lights. “You can disrobe behind the screen, bathe and cover yourself with the sheet. The manager will be in soon. You are in for a treat, he’s a maestro of joy, an auteur of orgasms. Just relax and melt away.”


Asher peeled her clothes away, dropping her skins to the floor in a heap, and showered the dried blood from her torso, before heading over to the bed and slipping under the sheets face down.


The door opened. “I’m just going to put on some music to set the mood.”


The first bars of sandstorm by Darude played and Asher’s face twisted in disgust at this messiah casanova. She lifted her head slightly to see two limbs, blurry in the low light as they came towards her.


“No peeking. I trust you are comfortable?” The man said as he approached and placed his hands on her back, they were warm and vibrating, like a massage chair. She groaned at the relaxation that transmitted across her whole body down to her toes.


“Mmm hmmm.” She said, barely able to string words together. She turned as he slipped himself between the - wait for it - sheets, the word was ‘sheets’ you horndogs, and he took her face in his hands and kissed her, a firm but tender kiss that was exactly what she needed, and the best kiss she had ever received - and she’d been kissed by Bellar the demon with seven tongues, and lemme tell you, those tongues made your average tentacled fuelled Hentai look like a cat o’ nine tails…unless you’re into S7M and then those two things might be the same to you. Look I can’t keep up with all your kinks, you dirty heathens. She ran her hands down his body, felt the toned muscle, the soft hair, the…cybernetic parts?


She pushed him away, and as he fell to the floor, he landed with a bone cracking crunch. As Asher rushed to the lights and switched them on, a broken Hallgrim lifted himself to his feet and relocated his metallic shoulder servo. “Listen lady, if you want the rough stuff, you gotta pay a little extr…Asher!?”


She rushed over to Hallgrim and pulled him to her, wrapping her arms around him. “Thank god.” She whispered, sounding close to tears. “I thought I was going to die here all alone. Are the others with you?”


Hallgrim enthusiastically, but cautiously returned her hug, but hover handed because he knew that she was like a domesticated tiger - happy if everything was perfect, but if she were hungry, tired or just plain fancied it, she’d tear your junk off and dance around in the blood fountain just for the hell of it. Look, Hallgrim had never seen a tiger and regretted the comparison instantly, alright? “No, I’ve been here a year and a bit on my own, none of our friends from our time are here. I thought you’d all left me, I was…it’s so good to see you, Ash.”


She looked into his eyes, a look passing between them - she’d obviously thought the same thing. She kissed him on the cheek, so happy to see him. “Erm…should we maybe get dressed.”


 “No need to be embarrassed, Ash. I’ve run this bordello for a year now. I’ve seen it all, mate. We’re both grown ups, we’re friends. We need to just get over it and move on, right?”


A year had obviously changed him, there was no double entendre, no smutty remarks. Amazed by his maturity, she pulled away from him, revealing herself to the overly cold air conditioning. Hallgrim tried his best not to look down, but the tendons in his neck pulsed as if they were tearing. Sweat dripped from his hairline, and Asher sighed. “Just look, before you burst a blood vessel.”


He looked down at her, eyebrows lifted. “Wowzers! Those are the best sweaterberries I’ve seen outside of Nips Chesticle, the Sheriff of Gash Gulch from Midnight Plowboy.” He whistled. “Killer on the streets, killer ‘tween the sheets, eh?”


Against her better nature, Ash rolled her eyes. “Thank you. I know that in your own, borderline problematic personality, you’re at least trying to be complimenta…what is that digging into me?”


Hallgrim shrugged uncomfortably. “Would you believe I had a new usb port installed down there?”


Asher pushed him across the bed and he landed in a heap on the other side of the room. “Why you?!” Asher screamed. “Of all the scummiest people I could’ve gone back in time and found, R Kelly, Lauren Boebert, Hitler, or the worst criminals of all time…writers who write a scene in a tv show with a phone conversation, but neither of the characters say goodbye and yet still understand when to hang up the phone…why did it have to be you?”


“Maybe you were drawn to me somehow. The groin wants what the groin wants, they say.” 


Asher went to pull her dagger from her sheath, only for Hallgrim’s oily, speedo nearly- wearing employee to burst through the door.


“Hey! You don’t interrupt an artist at work!” Hallgrim shouted at him. “I was about to start slinging paint at my favourite canvas.”


“You were more likely to be playing with your own brush, Spanksy.” Ash pulled on her clothes, as Hallgrim wrapped himself in a robe.


“Sir, they’re back.” The attendant said, and Asher suddenly became aware that people were screaming from outside and it wasn’t the usual screams from a Sexatorium. Hallgrim looked up at Asher with a look of panic.


“Splicers.” He hissed


***


The gormless townsfolk of the Velitean colony were lined up down the main parade of the town as a group of splicers - Velitean soldiers spliced with animal dna, like animorphs but cooler, because I wrote it - rode in on horses. There was a gorilla man in a small bowler hat, a rhino man carrying a boombox, a woman with the head of an eagle and the body of an eagle (or an eagle woman I guess is the efficient to write that), a wolfkin for all the furries out there, a younger snake woman, a dogman who was scratching his own head with his foot as he sat atop the horse, and at the head of the pack, an Alligator who was even bigger than Oryx. As soon as they dismounted, the horses stood up and rubbed their aching backs, because they were splicers too, but unfortunately weren’t unionised, and so were subject to misplacement in the workplace. Join or form a union, people. It’s the only way your bosses will take care of you, mainly due to fear.


The Alligator stepped forward, and it was then that Asher noticed they were all carrying weapons. laser rifles, laser swords, laser tech-9s, and in the hands of their leader, a large bazooka that wasn’t a laser bazooka per-se, but it did have a laser sight on it.


“They are armed to the teeth.” Asher whispered to Hallgrim in awe.


Hallgrim pulled his hood up over his easily recognisable Norn face. “Yeah, this point in history is around the time the combined powers want to go to war with the Reap. Tensions are high and every man and dog are packing on this planet.”


“Such as?” Asher asked.


“That dogman.” He pointed and Asher clipped him around the head.


A silence fell over the crowd as the Alligator levelled the bazooka at the people. “Yo, yo, yo party people and animal people who also like to party, make some noiiiiiise! For those newcomers to our colony and those in the back or with hearing difficulties, my handle is Grennix. I and my Splicer bois, much like some of you Veliteans assembled here, like some of the human and Norn families standing with them, come from rough rider families that fought for our freedom, cos freedom is trip as shit, yo. Our peeps rip and teared in a war through the universe and came together bonded by the spilling of our blood, ain’t that right Rex?” He looked over the dogman.


“Sorry, bro, what you sayin’?” The Dogman said with his tongue in his butthole.


“Never mind my dawg, you go to town on that brown gold. Now dis gangster ‘gator - the straight up double G - here to spit the truth. We gotta join the movement to take down dese Reap threatening the peace. You know what they all say, to keep the peace you gotta keep the gator gangster gat shooting, be it the truth or bullets.” He laughed. “Man, that was a trip G, write that down, Valis!”


The female snake sighed and brought out a notepad labelled, ‘Grennix’s rap lyrics’ and slowly wrote something down.


“That’s Valis.” Hallgrim nudged Asher. “Oryx’s sister, the one he had to kill.


“Now, I’m a reasonable mangator, so I want to talk to the Mayor so that I can take this here township under my protection like I have the other five on the colony so that we can all join in the glorious battle and likely get our faces shot off.’


A confused whisper rippled across the crowd, as the people looked at each other.


“Ooooooh,” Asher nodded. “He’s mentally deficient, I understand now.”


“He may have all the charisma of a hemorrhoid suppository, but that moron has developed a big following, mainly due to fear.” Hallgrim muttered. “These people need guidance and the only person offering any resistance is…oh here he is.”


A large, bumbling man with a flop sweat and a bad combover named Seldick Skids, stepped out of the crowd and walked into the centre of the assembly, wringing his hands. Unfortunately, somewhere down the street, a little girl by the name of Cutesy Pinchercheek was practising her tuba for the big college sportsball game halftime show at the weekend, and as she played some oompa music it synchronised with his footsteps to make poor Mayor Skids seem all the more ineffectual.


“Hello again, Mr Grennix.” The Mayor said, sweating profusely. “Our answer is the same as last time, it’s a ‘no’ I’m afraid.”


Grennix stepped forward and cast a huge shadow over the nervous Seldick. “No, is it? Well we’ll see, Mr Mayor.” He yelled out to the crowd. “Tell you for what, homie-steaders, you gots a day to change your brainwaves and get in line with the big dog…not you, Rex.”


Rex’s pricked ears went down and he whined in disappointment.


“And if you don’t change your mind, I’m going to kill you all before you have the honour of dying for me in battle, it’s a win win.”


Seldick cleared his throat in an uncharacteristic display of bravery. “I…erm…that is…to say…I make the decisions for the people here…the answer will still be…”


Grennix snapped forward in a flash, before Seldrick could even finish what we’re all sure would have been a rousing heroic defence and not just more babbling and nervousness, and when Grennix stood back up, Asher saw that the man just sort of ended at the ribcage. The townsfolk screamed and exclaimed, as Grennix spat up Seldick’s blazer and wiped his snout with it. “One day, motherfuckers!” 


He turned the bazooka into the crowd and fired a spray of pellets into the masses. One landed in Hallgrim’s hands and he unwrapped it to reveal a bright yellow T-Shirt with Grennix and his crew on the front, with tour dates for his new rap gig, ‘Gatorjams’. “Well, I’ve found our next date, Ash.”


“I would rather date Rex the dogman.”


“Makes sense, he’s got a long tongue and low enough standards.” Hallgrim muttered. “I’d certainly consider it.”


Grennix gestured for the Horsemen to get down on all fours. They groaned and then let the others back into their saddles and galloped off into the mid afternoon haze.


As the town strip cleared out, leaving Asher and Hallgrim in the middle of a cloud of dust, Hallgrim leaned in. “So, remember I said none of our friends from our time were here?”



***


The pair walked past a wooden sign that stated ‘all comers welcome’ and up to a small shack at the end of a swampy road three miles outside town. The building was surrounded by an allotment of fruits and vegetables that were being grown. There were cucumbers in the garden, but which plot were they in? Go back two episodes to find out which of you are right, and which os you have my eternal scorn. In amongst the dirt, on his knees in the mid afternoon sun, was a large crocodile in Dungarees and a handkerchief knotted on his head. He spun around to see the two intruders on his little plot and stood up, immediately walking towards Hallgrim. The Cyborg frowned, and Asher took a step to place herself between them, hand darting to the dagger at her waist.


“Hello Oryx. We have to talk.” Asher said.


The younger Oryx flashed a smile at them. “And as I told your humerous friend on numerous occasions, I am not interested. I don’t make bedfellows with Norn, whatever yarns he spins. I mean no offence by that, obviously.”


“Bedfellow? Mate, we’re buds an’ all, but I ain’t looking to go down to your below bayou, if you catch my drift?”


“Shut up.” Asher hissed, before turning back to Oryx. “So you have met Hallgrim before, which explains why you dislike him…wait, he didn’t try to put his penis in you, did he?”


Oryx laughed. “No. The ridiculous miscreant simply implied we were best friends in the future, his lies so transparent they defy all logic even without considering the preposterousness of time travel. I don’t think I could ever be so much as acquaintance with a Norn, not after the war.”


Asher squinted in disbelief, the math just didn’t add up. “It has been three centuries since the galactic war, what are you talking about?”


“Splicers can live extraordinarily long lives due to a combination of DNA resequencing and recreational drug use.” Oryx went back to gardening, tilling the earth with a trowel. “I have a tortoise Splicer friend who is approximately a millennia old. I don’t mean to be rude, but I have many duties to perform in order to get my harvest down to town, what is it that you require from me?”


Asher walked over to the plot of land he had been attending, she hated to pull him from this. “There is a man Grennix in town who…”


“I know, he and I were soldiers together.” Oryx waved a dismissive hand. “Your friend has told me a number of times that he will be the death of those in the town and that I should challenge him. ” Oryx sneered. “We were shock troopers, used as mindless anger fuelled weapons. I committed heinous obscenities, killed so many. I am not that man anymore.”


Hallgrim whistled. “So is that why you’re a giant puss now? Taking yourself away from the people who need you? Maybe if they’d known what a coward you were, they could’ve spliced you with a January 6ther.”


Asher glared at Hallgrim. “Will you…”


Hallgrim cleared his throat. “Nah, fuck that, let him hear this, he’s not pretty enough to be this dumb. He’s so stupid, he’d suck a dick for a ride and then still walk.”


“You are a juvenile.” Oryx hissed over his shoulder. “Your words can’t hurt me.”


Hallgrim strolled over to Oryx, crushing the carrots he had pulled from the soil deliberately under his heel, then bent down to whisper. “But going back to town and slipping it to your sister might. I wonder what it’ll be like to be spliced with a python twice?”


Oryx roared and lifted Hallgrim off the ground before slamming him back to the dirt, destroying his entire crop of cabbages. Drool dripped from his protruding teeth onto Hallgrim’s face, which stared into glassy red eyes that had lost all control.

 

Hallgrim spluttered, choked by the giant claws around his throat. “There you are, there’s the guy I know who wouldn’t let innocents suffer as he pretends to be Old MacFucking Donald.”


As he saw his own reflection in Hallgrim’s chrome eye fixture, Oryx recoiled, throwing himself back to the ground and releasing Hallgrim’s throat.


Asher, sighed. ‘Is this wonderful display of testosterone over? I am very impressed, yes, yes, big brave men, giant peepees all around.”


Oryx’s big, reptilian hands came up to meet his face. “Why? I tried so hard to escape this. Why would you make me like this again?”


“I’m sorry, mate. Truly.” Hallgrim said, patting his future friend on the back. “But we can’t escape the stepping stones that make us who we are, they’re a part of us, and coming to terms with that makes us whole. I’ve tried not to be an absolute dynamo in the sack and all around heartthrob, but I can’t fight nature. And you’re a hero. You are my best friend. And the man I know wouldn’t let innocents suffer.”


Asher lifted some of the crushed vegetables, placed them in Oryx’s basket. “Shall we go save your people and your sister, Martha Stewart?”


Oryx stood, a darkness to his face as he scowled and strode off. “Let’s go.”


Asher gave Hallgrim the side eye as she followed a ways behind. “You really think tough love was the way to go?”


He let her walk on, and watched her as she joined Oryx. “Is there any other type, Ash?” He muttered to himself.


***

“Yo, dis is my jam, boi! Play that song louder.” Grennix yelled from his table in the saloon, where he played laser cards with his crew.


“This is a piano, sir, I play as loud as the instrument allows.” said the laser piano player in the corner (look, it’s the future, I’m just adding ‘laser’ to everything, alright?)


The saloon went quiet, apart from the scooting of Grennix’s chair across the wooden floor. He marched over to the pianist and snorted out a breath that blew the man’s hat clean off. “I was just about to start beatboxing whilst my friend talked about his new nitrous injector on his ‘64 Laser Impala, yo. (OK I’LL STOP NOW) So are you saying that my anipals aren’t going to be able to listen to the underbeat whilst I improve upon said song with my lyrical love? Are you an Ali-hater, bro-ski?! This is my township, man, mine!”


The pianist started stammering, and Grennix laughed and turned to his crew. Some laughed nervously, not really into the intimidation techniques. Valis got up from her chair and turned towards the door. “I’m done, this isn’t leadership, this is kids stuff.”


Grennix gritted his teeth and his narrow eyes narrowed even further as he watched Valis push through the doors into the lit street beyond. He nodded to Rex. “Go pull that bitch back in here, dawg.”


Rex shook his jowls, covering his compatriots with slobber, and hopped off the chair after her, no sooner had he left the saloon, he heard the noise a dog makes when you accidentally tread on its tail, followed by “Aw, shit.”


“Rex?” Grennix called into the night. “Rex, you chasing that cat again, or is someone holding a laser pointer?” (LOOK THAT’S AN ACTUAL LASER THING, OK?)


“Guess again.” A growled voice came back from the gloom outside. “You and I have business to confabulate on, Grennix.”


“Oryx? That you, homie?” Grennix laughed, picking up his trucker's cap and aviator shades and resting them backwards on the top of his head precariously. “I thought you were one with nature and trees and shit, yo? You coming back to the Grennix Gang?”


“Something like that. Why don’t you join me out here so we can discuss it?”


***


Grennix walked into the street, flanked by his followers. Surrounding the saloon - and Grennix’s small ring of stones he had previously had set up to settle any and all disputes, from trade to divorce - were the inhabitants of the other five townships of the colony, standing firmly behind Oryx. 


Grennix stepped down to the street, before sauntering into the circle. “Well croco-damn, man! You brought all my peeps out to watch me take full control? That’s thoughtful of you, Oryx, gotta say.”


Oryx stepped into the ring and took off his reading glasses. “I’ve come to inform you, you’re not welcome in this colony anymore, Grennix. Take your repugnant ideas and your terrible whiteboy gang tendencies and go.”


“You challenging me, Bro? You challenging the Warrior?” Grennix unbuttoned his chequered shirt and threw it to the floor.  “You trying to fuck my sloppy seconds?”


“I’m sure it’ll feel brand new after the first half inch!” Hallgrim yelled, and Asher elbowed him in the ribs.


“I’m not challenging you, Grennix. I’m pointing out that you are no longer welcome any…”


Grennix threw his sunglasses at Oryx, who caught them just in time to see the charging alligator through them, who careened into Oryx and took him to the dusty floor.


“I been practising in this ring for the last 9 months, ya punk. I fought y way up from nothing. You can’t mess with this.” Grennix said as he buried his knee into Oryx’s ribs. “You ain’t got the scales to be a leader, you ain’t got the foresight, the strategy.”


Oryx grabbed Grennix’s knee and twisted him down with him. “You have two brain cells and they are fighting for fifth place. I carried you during the war, Grennix, I won’t help you any more.”


Grennix got to a knee then pounced on Oryx,the pair locked in a death roll that kicked up a cloud of dust. Asher stood on tiptoes to see what was happening, but could only make out the shapes. “I can’t separate them, I cannot see who is who.”


Hallgrim shrugged, and Asher noticed he had somehow secured popcorn from somewhere, offering her a piece. “Why don't you yell ‘see you later’ and see how each responds?” 


“Your mother should have taken it in the face.” Asher shook her head. “Should we get involved?”


Hallgrim considered. “We do that, Oryx loses face, and we need him to take control.”


“Why?” Asher said. “Why is that more important than just taking Grennix down?”


“You remember where he and I were when you first met us?” Hallgrim said through a mouthful of popcorn. “Oryx told me a while back about what led him to be incarcerated, it ain’t pretty, kid, but it’s making a lot of sense now. He’s got a rough road ahead of him.”


“And you’re pushing him towards that?” Asher was mad, remembering how she herself wound up in the demon dimension. “That’s so wrong.”


“So necessary.” Hallgrim sighed. “Oryx and I agreed when we first started travelling through time, we keep each other on our paths. Our friendship, our destination is important. I won’t let anything stop us freeing HUM13, or saving Kellan, or grabbing Florgo. I won’t lose my friends again. I won’t lose…” He looked at her.


As she realised what he was saying, she straightened slightly. “Hallgrim? What do you…?”


The assembled crowd cheered and the pair of them were doused in a sudden torrent of blood as Oryx tore Grennix’s tail clean off, and threw it into the distance. Rex the dogman hurried after it, tongue hanging out.


“Yield, Grennix.” Oryx and he were both bloody and battlescarred, breathing hard, an alligator tooth protruding out of Oryx’s arm. “I won’t ask again, but I won’t kill you.”


“Grennix is too much of a real G for anything less than first place, my brother.” He clutched his arm, which was bleeding profusely from a slash of Oryx’s claws, then charged, head down at Oryx, who sidestepped. He tripped over Oryx’s trailing tail and fell, smashing his head with a sickening squelch of blood and bone on the stone ring.


Oryx bent down to his former friend, taking his clawed hand in his. “I’m sorry, Grennix.”


“No sweat, friendo.” Grennix muttered through a snout full of blood and gore. “I go to a better place, to the great Def Jam in the sky, where rims are always spinning, booties are thicker than a submarine door, and grills are golden forever. Take me home, god.” He died in Oryx’s arms, and nobody was sad.


“People.” Oryx said to the assembly. “If you’lll have me, I intend to unite us all under one banner, to tell Ilima and Norn and Velit that we no longer wish to fight their wars, that the Reap are no enemies of ours. We can finally be free.”


A cheer went up, but credits did not roll.


NINE MONTHS LATER


Hallgrim was pissed, and Asher knew it. “What has you so low in corners of mouth?”


He put down the pen he had been doodling with and stared at Asher. “In’t it obvious? We should’ve rifted by now. We got lizard lips back on his path, our chapter here should have finished. We’re already 10 pages in, what is this, a Jeff Pennington special?”


She smiled, and continued monitoring the scanners. “This is the first time since the day I was lost that I feel truly content. I have had no need to sheath my dagger in months. It is wonderful to have a break from it all.”


“Aren’t you missing the others?” Hallgrim said.


Asher nodded. “Of course, but we have been helping Oryx to petition Ilima to leave us alone.”


Hallgrim sighed. “That just makes it worse, it doesn’t work. The Pillars will turn up and glass this planet and everyone on it, just like they did before.”


Ashe got up, walked over to him and wrapped an arm around his shoulder. She kissed him on the cheek. “You have said this until you are blue in face. He doesn’t care, I don’t care, the people don’t care. They have to try. They do not want to give up home. Let them have hope, my…”


The scanner sounded, and Asher gave Hallgrim a panicked look. She rushed to the readout, which showed a solitary blip on the screen. “Ambassador?” She asked.


“Just wait.” Hallgrim kept his eyes down.


The blip on the screen got larger, and Asher dared hope, but suddenly there were two more blips, then five, then ten. Hallgrim stood and moved to the scanner, placing his hand on her shoulder. “I’m sorry Ash, I really am.” He whispered.


Oryx rushed into the comms shed and took a place beside them. “Is this it, Hallgrim?” He asked. “I have Valis sending people to the shelters, and our soldiers are ready to engage.”


“I’m sorry buddy, it won’t be enough. You are the best friend I could have hoped for, in any timeline.” Hallgrim hugged Oryx, then went and sat next to Asher.


Making for the door, Oryx turned back to them, Asher was sobbing, the colony meaning as much to her as it did to him. “Everything will be…”


A pulsing rift of violet electricity ripped open next to Asher and Hallgrim, pulling them both from their seats and dragging Oryx towards it. Hallgrim grabbed the back of his chair and Asher’s hand, but he could feel himself slipping.


“Oryx!” He shouted against the noise of rushing air, and his hand slipped from the chair back, the Rift taking both of them in an instant.


Oryx pulled himself towards the door, but just as he saw the ships in low orbit start to attack the planet with pillars of superheated plasma, he was sucked into the Rift after them.


THE END
