S2 Episode 14:  Small Cuts


Prompts: Rivers & Graffiti


By Rich Masters


Prefix, I have had a grand total of four hours of spare time this week, which may result in a poor quality story by the typical Masters standards, one potentially littered with random tidbits of interconnected tomfoolery with seemingly nothing to link to this story. If you have any valid concerns or critiques about the narrative quality of this tale, please deliver your comments by whispering to my boot as it careens towards your face.


Florgo and Kellan spent their third day marching through the desert to the hazy, ominous structure in the distance that stood like a dark tear against the light horizon. She had the odd sensation she had been here before, but that might have been the four alarm Rift hangover and very real threat of dying of thirst. Like seriously, she was drier than a post-menopausal camel’s vagina after watching Boris Johnson speak on the economy. My god, how could the British could employ someone so dumb to run their country…oh wait, we have a history of accepting upper class twats with no qualification to rule us don’t we? cough cough the monarchy cough.


“All things considered, I’ve been in worse places.” Florgo said cheerily as they walked over the dunes. “The cold wastes of Norngarrd, the heated Velitean volcanic lakes, that time Hallgrim took me to that singles night and we got robbed by those lizard people he told me were descendents of the Kardashians, which wasn’t that far fetched when you think about it given the actual Kardashians turned out to be life sucking reptoids.”


“I could do without the cheeriness, Forgo.” Kellan dragged Doomcock tiredly, causing deep trenches in the sand behind her. It had not responded to her commands for days, and it almost seemed to be blocking her natural Rifting abilities. Who knew where the others could have ended up - somewhere else on this planet, in this system, or in any place or time in known and unknown history. They had as much chance of finding them as an average sized penis in that Pit of Sarlacc that your mother calls her private parts.


“I’m sorry, I’m just trying…” He started, but she waved a hand at him. 


“No, I’m sorry.” She sighed. “Rifting is the only thing I’m supposed to be able to do, and I fucked it up. I'm as crushed as a kid on careers day when her dad brings in his crypto investments.”


Florgo looked up at the midday sky, the sun already burning down on them. They would have to get into some shade quickly, or they’d burn like a redhead in a light morning fog. “We don’t know that. We don’t know why we were split up. Or why the hammer refuses to comply. All we know is the Rift brought us here, and that’s usually for a reason. Hey it’s not like I’m strong enough for magic at the moment either.”


Kellan nodded, but said nothing, determined to get to the structure in the distance. The closer they got, the lighter the hammer seemed to feel, as if it were propelling her there, as if it wanted to be there.


After another hour, they could clearly make out the craggy, wind eroded tower. Kellan understood why it seemed familiar - She had been here before, hidden in the vaulted high ceilings whilst she watched her future self justify her actions - it was the ancient ruins of Mt Barboros, the home of the pillars of Ilima. It was covered in graffiti. ‘Long Live the Amrays!’, and ‘The Pillars have fallen!’ and weirdly a cool S smoking a joint with sunglasses on and wearing a backwards cap.


 A man came from behind a cropping of rock, whistling tunelessly. He gestured to his compatriot who sat atop that same rock. Both were dressed in a hodgepodge of armour and gear, made up from Norn, Velit and Iliman styles. It all looked tarnished and thinned, as if it had been worn down over decades of misuse. “Well, well, well, Elodie. Lookie at these here lookie loos, come lookie looing at something they think is lookie looable.”


“New least favourite character.” Said Florgo. (along with Jeff and Josh.)


Elodie pointed a gun at the two wanderers, as she scratched her head with a small knife. “You said it, Davvik. I dunno what you said, but you sure said it with your mouth.”


Kellan noticed the sores on their skin, the facial deformities, the limited intelligence. They were either in some post war apocalyptic Ilima, or somehow the top of Mt Barbaros had been transported to modern day Florida. Now, I know, I know…We have listeners, and probably patrons from Florida, but come on - even you guys must get that Bugs Bunny, ‘sawing off Florida’ impulse at times. I’m aware you can be a good person in a bad location, I’m on this podcast for example.


Fun Fact the first - trypophobia is the phobia of tightly packed holes. Coincidentally the diametric opposite of yomommaphobia, which is my fear of large gaping ones. BACK TO THE STORY!


Kellan tried to raise the warhammer- getting it as far as her knees - as Florgo brought his book out and made some weird Dr Strange symbols with his hand (don’t bother watching the movie if you don’t get that reference, you ain’t missing much), but it was clear as crystal that they were about five minutes away from an idiot induced death.


“Lookie, the little dweebus is using a book of toilet paper like a weapon!” Davvik laughed as he pulled a small dagger from his belt.


“At least we’ll have something to wipe the blood off our boots with.” Elodie smiled before her face was suddenly covered in blood. She turned to watch as Davvik collapsed to the ground next to her, a craterous hole where his face used to be, a marked improvement on his looks.


“I thought I told you fuckers to get off my lawn?” A voice came from the ruins of Barbaros, and from the shadows stepped a woman dressed in skins, carrying a long rifle that looked like Callus, Wrath’s old longsight rifle. She wore the remains of Wrath’s bear helm, but it was cracked and broken all over, and grey hair poked through the holes in the metal.


“Kellan?” Florgo whispered towards the old woman.


The older Wrath approached Elodie, pointing the barrel of Callus directly at the space between her eyes, and also coincidentally, the space between her ears. 


“Please, Wrath. Don’t kill me, I was just trying to find something to trade for flood.” Elodie cried.


“You come here again, you’ll be trading sucking air for spitting blood.” Wrath slung the gun over one shoulder, and then walked past the scavenger to address Kellan and Florgo. She looked the two of them over as if surveying them. “What the hell are you two doing here?”


Elodie lifted her head with a smirk, and pulled her pistol up to Wrath’s back. Before Kellan could even warn her, Wrath pulled the trigger on her slung rifle that shot behind her and took Elodie’s head clean off her shoulders. “The end is where the bullets come out, dumbass.”


The heat took Kellan, and she passed out, Wrath’s helm the last thing she saw before black.

“But…how did you survive?” Kellan heard Florgo through the ajar door. “We saw the tanks…”


Kellan pulled herself out of the bed and set her feet on the cold floor of the bedchamber, looking around. This was once Grorp’s room, the rhyming bastard who had killed her mother. She went to the door and peered out, where Florgo and her future future self were sitting in the Quiet Hall, around the blue flames that used to signify the sessions of the Pillars of Ilima. She was at least twenty years older than the last time they had seen each other, her long grey, braided hair undercut to keep it neat and prevent the need for it to be cleaned. She looked cooler than she had any right to look. Kellan was surprisingly pleased to see her, and not simply because it meant she herself would survive to that age.


“Doomcock is pretty good at last minute escapes.” Wrath said. “That and smashing dickhead’s faces in.”


“Then can it send us back?” Kellan said as she pushed the door open. “Our friends, Asher, they’re all lost.”


Wrath went to her and hugged her, and Kellan found herself returning it. It felt like a hug from her mother, and suddenly all she wanted to do was bury herself in the thick, furry skins. She opened her eyes wide, suddenly realising that they were Asher’s old skins. She looked up at Wrath, who instantly understood. “They’re alright. For now, they’re fine. I promise.” She pushed her away to hold her at arm’s length to have a look at her. “You already look so much older, so beautiful.”


“Weirdly odd way to compliment yourself, bitch.” Kellan laughed.


Wrath smiled. “And still just as much of a twat.”


“What’s happened here, Wrath? This doesn’t look better. I thought you sent us away to change the future? ”


“You mean you don’t appreciate sand and mutant killer gangs with the IQ of a pot pie? When I was younger, not as young as you, but younger than me, but older than…you know, middle me…I thought we could change it all, just as my future self thought I could, and her Wrath probably thought she could.” Wrath grabbed some rolled up parchment and headed to the table. “But we could have been locked in this cycle for centuries. We can make small amendments to the timeline, but it’s like taking a diversion to see that statue of Paul Bunyan holding a hotdog, you still have to come back to Route 66, or risk being stuck in hicksville forever.”


Fun Fact the second- the original number of Route 66 was route 69, but people kept meeting up in the middle to try out weird sex positions, and considering the road goes through Oklahoma, they were worried about the sudden increase in birth rate of cross eyed babies, so they renamed it. No need to check that fact, I do my own research, ok?! BACK TO THE STORY!


“I thought if I didn’t look at Wrath’s instructions, if I ripped up her note…” Kellan felt such a fool. “So there’s no hope of changing things then?”


“I didn’t say that, did I? I just said we hadn’t found one yet. The big things will have to stay the same, the difficult choices, the awful steps. But the little things, the smallcuts, might just be the difference. The dates you went to, the Titanic, the old west, the bigfoot, that psycho cowboy and his talking squid that forged Doomcock, I went to all those places too. But, there are small things that are totally different. My Wrath didn’t know about Grorp turning on us or she would have told me, my Hum13 died on the Titanic when that bitch Rose couldn’t share a door properly, and maybe the weirdest one - I have no idea who you are.” She pointed at Florgo, who was taken aback.


“I wasn’t with you when you went out on your own?” Florgo said, astounded. “So I’m not boring, I’m unique!”


“I wouldn’t go that far, Harry Routiny.” Kellan said, patting him on the shoulder. “Then why did you let me take Florgo with us in the first place?”


Wrath shrugged and flattened out one of the scrolls on the table. “Because at that point, why not? The world was crashing down around us, if I could’ve sent you with the ‘95 Chicago Bulls, Dom Turetto, the Golden Girls, and Goku, I would have. I’d have taken any help I could get.”


Florgo felt an emptiness in his guts, he wasn’t meant to be here, he was surplus to requirments. “What do you have there?”


Kellan joined Wrath at the table, and saw an old and yellowing map with golden M’s placed all over. “It’s a map. by a company called McDonald.” She turned to Wrath. “Were they some sort of cartographer?”


“Yeah, leading the way to diabetes and beef with such low grade the cows had to subside on college sports scholarships. This was one of the countries from Earth That Was, a place called America.” Wrath smoothed another map over the top of the McDonald’s corporate map. Bar some severe coastal erosion and the large parts of blackened desert they called the Glass Fields, the maps were almost identical. “And this is Breakthrone, and there next to the hand of water, is…”


“Ilima.” Kellan muttered. “They told us Earth That Was was gone.”


Florgo got on the floor and slammed his fist into the ground. “Those manics! They blew it up. Damn them all to hell.” He looked up, with a smile on his face, as Wrath and Kellan rolled their eyes. 


“What do you see in this doofus?” Wrath said.


“Less and less each day.” Kellan sighed. “What about the Greywoods?”


Wrath hung her head. “They stoked the fires of war, and stripped this whole planet of its lustre. Whatever they did seemed to trigger an entire ecological meltdown and I’d say this planet has as much chance now as a woman not having something she’s done for years explained to her by a man without asking.”


“Well the reason…” Florgo began, but shut his mouth when they both turned to him. “I mean “Shut up Florgo, you penis-laden idiot”.’


“There’s something up with them. Something terribly wrong. All I know is they’re not who they say they are.”


Doomcock started flickering, spitting sparks from the head of the warhammer. Kellan felt it tug at her soul, and she reached for Wrath, her fingers phasing through as they went to touch. “I need you.” Doomcock tore a hole above them, from which sunlight poured into the room. Kellan mouthed a goodbye to Wrath before the two of them were ripped upwards into the Rift.


“Nah, you don’t.” Wrath smiled as the Rift closed, the lines etched in her face gathering around her eyes and mouth. “Knock ‘em dead, me.”


***


Florgo opened his eyes into the early evening sky to the sound of children laughing. He looked around for Kellan, but she was nowhere to be found, even though the sweet imprint of her butt graced the sand next to his.


“Kellan, I want to go home!” a young voice whined from the distance.


“Catch me then we talk, pussy!” Another, slightly older voice returned.


He sat up and moved to the ridge, then hunkered down. There amongst the mountainside, skipping and jumping over the ragged peaks of rock, were two small girls. One sported straight blonde hair, and the other, older girl had wavy auburn locks. She looked like…


“It’s me.” Kellan said next to him. He jumped at the sound of her flat voice, the pain buried deeper than your average Terf’s IQ. “Annoying little prick, aren’t I?”


“Is..Is this…”


“The day Asher was lost?” Kellan nodded, she looked out, past the girls to the stunning cityscape ahead of her. Ilima - the white city - stood proud with the crystal buildings surrounded by cool blue lakes. She missed it. Her mum, her dad, her brothers. Who knew if they were even alive? Who could even remember their names, even though they seemed important back when the story was first being written, who indeed? Kellan had sworn the next time she returned, it would be to put things right and free her planet, but here she was about to re-witness the most traumatic event of her childhood. Even worse than that time a kid shit his pants in assembly next to me while we were singing The Lord Of The Dance. I mean full on shit his pants to the point we had to evacuate the hall. Turns out Barry, that just sticking everything you found on the floor in your mouth all the time makes you have gut rot. I can only assume he had found a turd and stuck it in his mouth, for how bad that river of shit was. Fuck you, Barry, you weird little fecal castastrophe.


Florgo was speechless, and watched as the two girls frolicked and teased each other, as they entertained themselves with the useless shit kids do, until the words became sharp and young Kellan pushed Asher a little too hard, and she tripped, crashing hard to the stone outcrop. Asher yelped in pain, and called her a name your sensitive little ears couldn’t cope with…you pussy ass little bitch Klemens.


Young Kellan laughed. “Hurt your widdle knee? Need to gwow some lady balls if you’re going to be a gweat Duchess.”


“At least I have a place! I’m not adopted, you hanger-on.” Asher said, wiping a tear from her eye. 


Kellan grabbed Florgo’s shoulder, and he slowly turned to her, she was crying, tears flowing freely. “Don’t watch Florgo, please. I can’t have you thinking worse of me.”


“I couldn’t think any worse of you…I mean..I won’t think worse of you.”


“So comforting, Florgo.” Kellan shook her head. 


“Yes ma’am.” He muttered. He turned, like he had a hook in his mouth. The young girl in front of him shook with anger, and the stones beneath her started lifting from the ground, like when superman flies in a Snyder film. Quick aside, how stupid is that? Like, just let the man fly, he’s a kryptonian not an excavator. 


A Rift opened between them, a tear of red that pulsed and crackled as if it were your mum before she takes her gonorrhoea medicine. Crackling electricity struck the rocks next to Asher. She slipped on the unsteady ground and fell towards the Rift. Young Kellan caught her by the wrist, leaning forward over the rock she was standing on to reach her.


“My first Rift.” Kellan whispered. “The one that I thought killed my baby sister.”


Florgo watched as Asher started climbing out of the Rift, using the crevices in the rock face to pull herself out gradually but surely. “Kellan?” Florgo whispered.


Kellan watched as young Asher pulled herself up, nearly out of the Rift as young Kellan pulled. She pushed Florgo to one side roughly and took his position on the rock overlooking the two children. Her sister could have her freedom back, could have a normal childhood, could maybe not grow up to be a stabby psychopath with a weirdly unexplainable Russian accent. She found herself smiling, and turned to Florgo hurriedly, but found him shaking his head.


“We can’t let her stay here.”


“What do you mean? We..we…could save her!” Kellan was spluttering, desperate.


“Wrath said we couldn’t deviate, that we had to do small cuts.” 


“This isn’t a fucking self help book, it’s my family.” Kellan snapped.


“And she won’t become the sister you know now if we save her. You won’t be the same. You’ll destroy all we worked for.” Florgo said. “We’ll kill our friends. Wipe them away like bird bones from a spell mat when casually researching love spells for no reason relevant to this conversation.”


Kellan shook her head. He was right, she knew it. She couldn’t lose Oryx, or HUM13, or her young, but older sister. “I can’t…I can’t…wait, what are you talking about bird bones and love spells?”


Florgo reached a hand out towards Asher. “Lavestis.” He said, before Kellan could stop her.


Asher’s foothold cracked and turned to dust, and she fell. It was slow motion, both Kellans watched as their sister fell into hell, as her screams filled the outcrop like my screams filled that assembly hall as Barry Rider’s poop gusher flew towards me. Fuck you again Barry, I hope maggots are eating your dysentary ridden corpse.


Kellan’s chest felt like it was going to cave in, like Florgo had pushed her heart into the Rift along with it. She watched as her screaming young selfran from the scene, desperate for someone to help her, scared by what she’d seen. The guilt that would plague her all her life, the loss of her sister, was her best friend’s fault? 


“Why?” Kellan sneered.


Florgo swallowed. “I..I didn’t have a choice, I did it so that you wouldn’t have to…” He reached for her, but she pulled her arm away, disgusted. She swung Doomcock at him, which he barely dodged.


She looked at him as if she would Rift the very flesh from her bones. “If I see you again, I’ll kill you.” Kellan stood, hopped over the rock dune with Doomcock in tow, and threw herself into the Rift. Florgo yelled after her, but it was too late. And as the Rift began to close, he cursed under his breath, and jumped in after her.


Fun Fact the Third - this week on Friends, laugh at Monica’s clearly undiagnosed ADHD and Bipolar conditions, Phoebe's sociopathy, Rachel’s white privilege as she gets promoted through sheer luck, Ross’ weekly homophobia, controlling behaviour and self loathing, Chandler’s obvious depression and Joey. TV Guide 1994 says Follow the lives of six reckless adults living in Manhattan, as they indulge in adventures which make their lives both troublesome and happening…WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?! BACK TO THE STORY!


***


The heat of the demon dimension was unbearable, a heat that baked dog turds white on the pavement, that pasted your clothes to your computer chair, that still wasn’t quite as humid or annoying as Florida. I mean it was filled with old boomer Floridians, but still. Hell was better.


A hand took Kellan’s and pulled her up to her feet, and she gritted her teeth to shout at Florgo before realising that the hand was green and warty. As she stood, the full gravity of her situation hit her. A Dick’s Sporting Goods ran by a horned demon that only sold hunting hats, a starbucks, a man on the porch of his rocky cave who was bleeding from a slow knife wound onto his own feet but didn’t seem to mind, mimes everywhere - like this random demon was crossing the street and he walked around two mimes who looked like they were carrying fake glass, but instead of fake glass, it was real glass they were carrying, and when the demon walked into it and broke it, they took the shards and shivved the guy with it. There were offices where people had to watch demons through one way mirrors use software that they used everyday, but the demons didn’t know any of the hotkeys! Every tube of toothpaste was squeezed in the middle and there was toothpaste around the lid and there were stray pubic hairs in the paste caked there. There were random one hour meetings ran by people with a 100 page slide deck filled with walls of text that the presenter was reading word for word. There was James Corbyn. That’s it, just James Corbyn, he was there, the Hitler of television. 


Kellan grabbed Doomcock, and looked feverishly around for Asher, but the place was filled with demon and humanoid, being tortured, bored, or otherwise inconvenienced. There was no use, she’d never find her in this. A hand reached up and tugged at her shirt. The demon! Maybe he would know how to find her.


She hunkered down as a woman ran by her, aflame and screaming, after she’d taken a dip in the river of magma. Wait, did I do ‘Rivers’ already? With the way I phoned these in, who the fuck knows anymore. Kellan looked at the little demon, who was almost ethereal, a creature of smoke and gloom. He flashed a fang filled grin at her.


“Can you help me? I need to find my sister. I’m Kellan.” She stretched her hand out.

The Demon took her hand and shook it wildly. 


“If finding your sibling be your aim,

Follow old Grorp, for that be my name.”


THE END
