Rock Out with Your Sock Out

By Rich Masters

Prompts: Socks and Katanas

In the depths of space, as wide and open as your mum’s legs, and as cold and dark as your dad’s reason for leaving you, the recovery ship Lighthouse floated powerless. Inside, seven crew members stood between Tamia Santo and her destination. With the crimson laser katana she held in her hands, she knew they wouldn’t be enough.

“Engineer Santo, you are ordered to stand down!” one sneered.

Tamia smiled. “Stand down?! You guys will all be lying down in about thirty seconds. B…because you’ll be dead!”

“You need to work on that smack talk, girl. You’re making me wish I’d been dug up by some curious dog.”

Tamia looked down at the Katana in her hand, it throbbed harder than the ‘back massager’ she had brought aboard the Lighthouse. She released the hilt and brought the hand covered with a sock to her face. The sock shook its ‘head’, somehow looking disappointed, even without eyes.

“You’re embarrassing me, Hijoki.” She hissed.

“I’m embarrassing you?!” The sock hissed back. “ I could eat a bowl of alphabetty spaghetti and shit a better comeback than that.”

“You’re embodying a sweaty sports sock, you don’t even eat!” She whispered, suddenly aware that the crew she had recently been a part of were staring at her in confusion.

***RECORD SCRATCH***

Now I know what you’re wondering, ‘how the hell did a newbie engineer cum straight A student like Tamia Santo become a crazy space samurai with a sock puppet’…oh wait, you're questioning my use of the word ‘cum’? Cum doesn’t just mean jizz, you filthmonger, it’s used to describe things that have a dual function - like a study-cum-bedroom. (Heheheh ‘cum bedroom’.) Well, wonder no more, because we’re going to do a flashback! Consider the above a cold open, like your ex’s legs. Hey oh!

Tamia opened the airlock to meet with silence, and she and Captain Hawklin stepped off their shuttle and onto the cold derelict in full environmental suits that only smelled vaguely of the stale farts of the previous user.

The sleazy Captain came up behind her and placed a hand on her shoulder. “Well done, spanner jockey.” He had known her for five weeks, and didn’t even remember her first name apparently, so this physical contact was in no way appropriate. She’d considered reporting it, but the crew were all really chummy, sickeningly so, like some sort of (shudder) family. It was odd, but Tamia had resolved to just suffer it out on her rotation and then put in a transfer as soon as her contract was up and her promotion was secure. She just had to make sure that Hawklin knew that the derelict would be the only thing he would be docking with tonight.

“I’ll head to Engineering, see if I can get the power back up.” She said. Hawklin confirmed he would head to the bridge - probably to check if the chair was comfier than his and if the deceased captain had any good booze or drugs. Avoiding Hawklin’s leering gaze, and resisting the urge to punch a dude in the face for the 50,000th time in her life - she was of course a woman, and well practised - she jogged towards Engineering.

Tamia hadn't been with the Blue Raven Salvage unit very long, salvage always seemed a bit in poor taste, especially in the deep sectors. The reason for finding derelicts this far out was normally dumbass colonists disembarking without enough supplies, as if they’d never played Oregan Trail, or a Captain gone mad in the deep black and spacing their crew because he thought they were space pixies, or some giant space creature thinking the ship was a potential mate and fucking the cargo bay into oblivion. You know, the usuals. But she’d been found on a ship like this, the soul survivor when the environmentals had failed and her parents had just enough time to put her in a space suit before they’d asphyxiated.

After she had spent a good thirty minutes in the true engineers style - pretending to work while she napped - she flicked the most obvious switch she could find and rerouted power past the damaged relays from the portable generator she’d brought from the Lighthouse. Lights flickered on and she gasped, but you know, in a brave way. She rounded the panel and finally saw fully what had done for the ship’s engine: a dead body lay skewered to the main panel to the rear of the hyperdrive engine with what looked like a sword hilt. As she approached, Tamia noticed the patch on the jumpsuit of the once humanoid-kebab - The Blue Ravens. But that didn’t make any sense, they were the first ones to report to the scene, weren’t they? After calling Hawklin but getting nothing in return - the dumbass hadn’t even turned his communicator off silent - Tamia’s curiosity got the better of her, and she decided to pull out whatever had made her fellow Blue Raven into a man-cicle. She realised suddenly that she hadn’t brought her gauntlets, so quickly removed one of her white insulated Engineer socks and pulled it over her hand.  Tamia reached a hand to the hilt gingerly, and as her socked fingers glanced the steel, hot electricity shot through her hands and her vision went immediately dark.

“Tamia, you freed me.”

***

She woke with a start in the Medbay, all alone, Doctor Banyo and his staff nowhere to be seen, in one of those gowns where your arse hangs out the back. Why did they make people wear these things? Was it for ease of going to the toilet? Because lemme tell ya folks, few things makes taking a shit less dignified than flapping loose fabric threatening to dunk itself in the toilet bowl.

“Doc?” she yelled to the far end of the room. “Why do they make people wear these gowns, few things make taking a shit…”

“Be quiet, child. You’re going to give us away.”

Under the sheet, something stirred. She took the crisp white covering in her left hand and pulled it back, and as she did her socked hand rose to meet her. “Now listen.” It spoke, her fingers inside involuntarily parting to form a mouth. “Don’t freak out.”

Tamia looked around for the doctor, even more convinced she needed to speak to him now. A life smoking that sweet Delta Nine Leaf had obviously taken its toll.

The sock looked her up and down. “You’re not mad, though yes, you do smoke too much. I am the spirit of Lord Hijoki.”

“You going to spin me a yarn? You get it? Yarn, because you’re…you’re a sock. And a hallucination.” Tamia jumped out of bed and searched for her clothes, but they were nowhere to be found, as absent as her sanity.

“I’m not a hallucination, I’m the spirit of the Captain of the ship you were on. Have you heard of the Clan of the Photonic Blade?”

“Oh, please let this not be a Space-entology type thing, I’m not interested in some subliminal cult pyramid scheme.”

“Don’t be disrespectful, girl!” Hijoki chided her. “Our race can transfer their souls into objects when near death, so that our knowledge can be transferred to our descendants.”

“Yep, that all sounds totally sane. I’m totally convinced.” She nodded as she made her way out of sickbay to the briefing room, in her arse-less gown with a talking sock on her hand.

Hijoki sighed. “Please don’t let me have transferred into a fucking idiot. Or worse, yet another murderer and thief.”

“Woah woah woah. You might be a stress or drug induced hallucination, but what makes you think I’d be a murderer?”

“You think that dead Blue Raven was sight-seeing on our ship when I stabbed him in his heart?”

“What are you saying? I don’t put much stock in stories told by a sock. Get it? Stocking? Because you’re a sock.” She giggled.

“You seem to be an intelligent sort, so let me explain this in terms a cabbage can understand. The Blue Raven company aren’t Salvagers, they’re Scavengers. One of their ships disabled our vessel and airlocked my crew, ready for you lot to follow a week later and grave rob.”

“I don’t believe you.” She said, stopping in her tracks. The crew were obnoxiously cute, except for Captain Hawklin, who while skeezy was always talking about honour and duty and all that eye roll worthy stuff. “We’ll see what the captain has to say about this.”

The two walked the rest of the way in silence to the briefing room, until Hijoki started humming that ‘munuma num’ song from the Muppets, and by the time Tamia arrived at the briefing room door, she found they had begun harmonising. “Oh stop.” She whispered as she realised.

As Hijoki began to defend himself, a voice cut through their argument, a voice she identified as the science officer, Lt Garrington. “Why the hell did they leave the body there, sir? Surely they realised they were a person down?”

“According to Commander L’Tain, they couldn’t prise Ensign Phabix off the panel. He tried to fight that samurai looking alien Captain of theirs with a welding iron.” This voice was Doctor Banyo. (Banyo? did I call the doc that. I gotta be honest, I’m too lazy to scroll up to check and this guy isn’t going to last much longer, so it’s diminished returns you know?)

“I told you, girl. Your crew are a bunch of savages.” Hijoki coughed and then spat a ball of lint out. “This is intolerable, Tamia. I cannot be a sock forever. How do we transfer me to a new body?”

“Darned, if I know.” Tamia giggled. “Darned. Because, you know…”

“I’m a sock, yes I understand.”

Chief Engineer Hettio was next to speak. “We followed the Oathkeeper? That ship full of jackasses could’ve bloody let us know. I wouldn’t have sent the young’un over with the Captain if we had’ve had some bloody warning. Whole mission was a bust if we can’t get that Maguffinium out of their safe!”

“We going to have ta kill her?” That was Chell, the ship’s chef…was Tamia the only one that didn’t know?

“We have to, we can’t risk the Captain finding out about this.” Hettio sneered. So…Captain Hawklin didn’t know about this. Could Tamia use this to her advantage?

Tamia stood with her back to the wall, took a deep sigh and weighed her options.

“What are we going to do?” Hijoki asked.

“I dunno about you, but I’m looking out for myself.” Tamia huffed and entered the room. Ten of the senior staff sat huddled around a centre table, where the sword was held in containment. As she walked in and sat, as graceful as she could with her butt hanging out, ten sets of eyes followed her. Oh wait, eleven: Lt Quatroclops was there too.

“You don’t have to worry about me, I’m in.” Tamia declared, looking them all in the eyes unwavering, except Quatroclops, where wavering was necessary. “I don’t know these people, who cares what happened to them.”

“How can we trust you?” Quatroclops asked, steepling fingers in front of his face.

“Well, I can tell you all about this.” Tamia brought a hand up and revealed Hijoki to the assembled crew. “So we can figure out how to put him back in that sword and get that Maguffinium.”

Hijoki writhed around, unable to free himself from her hand. “You traitor! I came to you for help!”

“He’s the Captain of the ship, he should be able to help us get in their safe.” Tamia smiled.

The comms system sounded. “Engineer Santo, please report to the captain’s ready room.”

They turned to Chief Engineer Hettio. “Go. Take the sword and keep it with you, fucking thing doesn’t work anyway. See if you can figure out how to get your sock puppet back inside. Don’t tell the captain about any of this.”

She left, hilt in hand, keen to see her CO, but taking a slight detour first.

***

Captain Hawklin sat at his desk, listening to the classical piece, ‘Bubble Butt’ by the composer/military man Major Lazer and reading the old classic novel, Ready Player 4. “Oh Cline, you’ve done it again. “ He said, before putting the book down at the sound of his door chiming. “Enter.” He ordered.

“Captain!” Tamia rushed in. “The senior staff, they’re involved in some sort of conspiracy. They’ve been disabling and robbing ships!”

The captain rose, concerned about his young charge. “Tamia, are you certain about this?”

“Absolutely, sir. They’re actively working against your wishes, to hide their activities from you.” Tamia said, feeling her sock-companion’s relief at the reveal of her bluff.

“Security to my ready room.” Hawklin put a hand to Tamia’s shoulder, giving it a small squeeze as he smiled. “ We’ll sort this out, Tamia. Nearly everyone on this ship is still loyal to me.”

The doors whooshed open to reveal Commander Quatroclops at the head of a five strong team. “Come with us, Engineer.”

The captain looked exasperated. “Damn it guys, I told you I didn’t want to be disturbed with the details. Kill, steal, dress up like juggalos for all I care. Do whatever you want to make the cash, I just want to finish my book! I’ve got 14 more volumes to go. Let’s take her down to the brig.”

(Editors Note: If you didn’t know the captain was evil for reading Ethan Cline, than I don’t have anything more to say to you.)

“If the Technomancer hears of this, we’ll be mincemeat. Get her out of here.”

Tamia felt like the prize turkey on Thanksgiving, and as she walked down the corridor led by Hawklin, she knew her giblets were well and truly cooked.

“Hey, numbskull.” A voice at her hip whispered. “You got a damn sword, remember?”

“How?” Tamia muttered from the side of her mouth.

“Put your hand on the shaft.”

“I’ve fallen for that trick too many times before.” She smirked.

“Lords above girl. Hold the sword!”

She reached for her belt and pulled the sword off the clip she’d used to tether it. It ached in her hand, ached to be free. All it’s power, dead until now, came flooding through her fingers and ignited the blade, Crimson and terrible and fizzing with power.

It lit the hallway like an early morning club, but there would be no early hours groping, no terrible grinding dancing, just seven murderers and a sharp edged justice bringer…and a talking sock of course.

Tamia hit her communicator twice, and the contingency plan she had set up in Engineering on her little detour - a cascade failure in the hyperdrive, triggered. The ship powered down and listed helplessly, the only light a crimson light sword that was going to fuck seven bitches’ days up.

And with that out flashback is done, and the standoff is finally here.

The security crew had their stun sticks at the ready, probably before there was a threat, because even space cops are cops, and a woman with a name like Tamia was never coming out unscathed, was she? ACAB, even in space.

“Walk away.” Tamia whispered. “Let me get in the escape pod and you can keep all your arms and legs and fix your broken ship.

Captain Hawklin smirked. “Get her.”

“Let’s sock it to them.” Tamia grinned, feeling Hijoki shudder in disgust.

It would be hard to describe what happened next, but since I’m writing this story, it’d be shitty of me not to try, so I shall. Something coursed through Tamia, the weight of all Hijoki’s progenitor knowledge, fifty generations of swordsmanship passed down, to combine with…those five crunches Tamia did every morning.

She rose on tiptoes, and as the first woman of the security squad ran at her screaming, she pivoted like a top, but kept the blade level and still, catching her with the edge of the blade and letting her momentum skin her like a rabbit. The Scavenger’s flayed body covered her exposed flesh with her hands comically before realising she was dead, then she slumped to the floor. An explosion rocked the ship. She and Hijoki needed to get to the escape pods quickly.

The next, a hulking man named Redrow, came at her dead on, and Hijoki instructed Tamia to stab forcefully forward. Redrow was penetrated so deep his grandchildren at home clutched their stomachs. What? Yes the kids mourned, but then their grandpa shouldn't have been a murdering scumbag, should he?

Tamia brought the blade up and down quickly, cutting two more of the security detail - one man and one woman - in half and bringing one’s left and ones’ right side down to the floor in a bloody heap. The two remaining halves slopped together to create a dead half man, half woman. Somewhere, the evil techno-witch JK Rowling stamped her foot and sobbed as she assumed the attack somehow eroded her binary gender identity ideals. Fuck you, you terf hack!

Now there were three, Chell the cook, Quatroclops, and Captain Hawklin. Chell and Quatroclops came at them together, Tamia backflipping out of the way of Chell’s swinging pan, which donged off Quartoclops’ head, all four of his eyes rolling. As he apologised, Hijoki lurched forward, putting his mouth over Chell’s and choking him with the smell of an engineer’s sweaty foot. As Chell passed out, Tamia slit his throat, coating her and Hijoki in the slick blood of their enemy. Hawklin ran away down the hallway, presumably to the escape pods. As Quatroclops rallied and went to grab her.

“What’s that?” Hijoki gestured behind him, and because he was nonspecific because he had no fingers to point with, and because Quatroclops wasn’t a four-eyes in the traditionally perceived smart way, all four of Quatroclop’s eyes turned independently, trying to locate the disturbance, making it easier for Tamia to jump up and slice the idiots head off. As the head rolled to the floor, Quatroclops eyes all rolled round and settled centrally, like a slot machine that paid out in blood.

She found Captain Hawklin five minutes later, unable to launch his escape pod, as his skills were more in the ‘sitting back and doing fuck all’ wheelhouse, like any capitalist CEO. He scrambled with the controls, unaware of Tamia and Hijoki until her sword embedded in the side of the pod above his head. He turned to her, eyes watering and voice wavering like all misogynist man babies when you confront them. “Please let me go.”

“My parents died on a ship like that one.” Tamia whispered. “People like you had a hand in it.” She hit the control panel to prep the escape pod, and buckled Hawklin in.

“You’re letting me live?” He asked. Tears of gratitude streaming down his face.

“Yeah.” Tamia said as she wrenched the katana from the wall, hearing the slow release of air from the compromised bulkhead. “For the remaining five minutes of your life.” She ejected the escape pod, watching it fly off hissing into space. “Bon Voyage, Captain.”

“Now that was good smack talk, kiddo!” Hijoki laughed.

Tamia got into the remaining pod, placed the sword, her ‘back massager’, and some other personal effects inside and left the burning ship she had briefly called home.

“Computer.” She announced, getting the beep of acknowledgement in response. “Tell me more about this ‘Technomancer’.”

THE END
