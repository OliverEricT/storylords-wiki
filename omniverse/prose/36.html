Episode 10:  Who Let The Fog Out.


Prompts: Trombones and Miasma


By Rich Masters


The year - 1912. The place - the Atlantic ocean. The more specific place - the RMS Titanic. Yeah, alright I admit, that’s a hell of a lazy opening, but I gotta level with you, and it’s time for some real ass, hard dick, true tits, Rich Masters fact (shirt THAT motherfuckers) - I turned 40 last week. Anyone who says 40 is the new 30 is a lying crock of festering, maggoty, shit. My back aches more than your mother’s loins ache for any male attention after scouring the ‘dinners for one’ section of the supermarket for hot 20 somethings. There’s a reason that our life expectancy was 35- 40 years old in the 17th century, because lemme tell you people, it ain’t sunshine and roses, more like light at the end of the tunnel and agony weeds. So I apologise for this dour pening (again, much like your mother’s), but you know I’ll make up for it with some very near the mark jokes, so don’t get your pitchforks and torches yet, Storysquires.


So yeah, the crew were on the Titanic, and I bet you lot are thinking, ‘we know what’s going to happen, how is he going to make this interesting?’ And to that I say ‘bitch, I got a fucking eight foot tall crocodile man walking around the Titanic with a nomadic Russian assassin from a demon world and a sex obsessed cyborg - you don’t know shit.’ Smoke ‘em if you got ‘em.


“This ship is pretty cool, but maybe if we just keep in our cabins out of sight, this’ll be a stop without a hitch.” Florgo said as he uncharacteristically looked around as if checking for danger rather than being all smiley and sickening like normal. Florgo still didn’t have much of a personality apart from an all surface and no depth ‘positive person’, pretty much the same as your average gen z ticktocker. Hold on for a second. (typing sounds) most…tragic ways…to kill…off…characters…and bookmarked! For a completely different project, of course. 


“Are you braindead? Why would you say things like that on page 1?” Asher side eyed him in her elegant gown, a shawl covering her toned arms and tattoos. “We’ve been here two weeks without any kookiness.”


“Because he’s a plucky idiot who thinks everything is going to turn out hunky dory, because nothing bad has ever happened in his life.” Hallgrim said. He was dressed as a Victorian gentleman, his face largely hidden by a scarf. “I mean I assume, I care about his backstory even less than HUM13’s.” 


HUM13 took off his fake monocle and pretended to polish it. The crew had painted his body a soft fleshtone, but it was in no way convincing. “T’was the midpoint of July, Saint Swithin’s day, when HUM13 first drew air into his vents, I mean lungs. My mother, Doctor Anna Tomika…”


“I said I don’t care…” Hallgrim sighed. “If you tell a tragic story, I’ll only have to make up one for myself to illicit more sympathy out of jealousy.”

“Whatever the case, I refuse to go below decks again.” HUM13 announced. I am already late for an appointment. A woman I met yesterday has expressed interest in me holding her at the front of the ship while she holds her arms aloft to simulate flyin…” Hum13 stopped as he stared towards the front of the boat where a man was holding  a well to do woman off the bow. He hung his head and played a compressed version of the opening bars of ‘Hopelessly Devoted to You’. “Always the bridesmaid…”


Kellan stood at the railing in her long dress, looking out over the Pacific, and yelled out to no one. “I miss Oryx, I sure hope he’s ok.”


Two loud clangs came from underneath a tarp covering the lifeboat below, as Oryx confirmed he was ok.


“Maybe he’d want me to take a shit off the side into his lifeboat?” Hallgrim shouted into the wind. “Literal shits and giggles.”


One loud clang of protest came from the lifeboat, and Hallgrim laughed. For once, maybe Florgo was right, perhaps this could be an easier ride until Kellan recharged. Just for once, they could kick back, relax and just enjoy themselves.


“There, there he is! Stop that sex pervert!” A loud voice came from behind them, and the group turned to see an obviously wealthy and suited man rushing towards them whilst wagging his finger and accompanied by four ship's stewards. Kellan took a deep breath, prepping herself for a debate with a grade-A wank-tank for numerous reasons. One, he was carrying a cane though not to walk with, just twirling it around as though he was leading a brass band. Two, he wore a white suite, and he wasn’t selling orange juice. It was more like a plantation owner’s suit, if you get my gist. Finally and third, he had a handkerchief that poked out of his jacket pocket, with the letters BJ monogrammed on them. I mean, I’m not even touching that one.


Hallgrim took a step behind Asher for protection, and Asher could feel her blood beginning to boil almost immediately. “You Cyborg Shyster. What the hell have you done now?”


The suit stopped in front of Florgo and grabbed him roughly by the collar. “This dark-skinned ruffian took my sweet Leticia from me! We were due to be married as soon as we got to New York.”


Everyone except Florgo, who was being lifted off the floor by the wealthy dickhead turned to Hallgrim in frustration. Asher poked at him. “If you knew this wasn’t about you, why did you hide behind me?”


“Someone shouted ‘sex pervert’, so I naturally assumed.” Hallgrim blushed.


From down in the lifeboat, two clangs sounded.


“I’m sorry, but what makes you think our friend here has seduced your wife, Lord Cuckington?” Kellan asked. 


“I didn’t say he seduced her, you impertinent waif!” The stewards put Florgo into handcuffs as the snooty dickhead explained. “But the Duchess had one conversation with this foreigner, just one, and then when I, Lord Berwick Chesterton, went to her cabin to see if she was ready for dinner, she had vanished. All that was there to mark her passing were these…” 


He held up some black candles.


“Sweet.” Hallgrim whispered.


He then raised a set of metal manacles.


Hallgrim raised a hand. “Fuck yes! Up top, Florgo!”


“And these…” The man then raised some small child skulls, perfectly cleaned and bleached. 


Hallgrim slowly put his hand down and shrugged. “Errrrr…whatever floats your meat boat I guess…”


“He’s clearly a black magic deviant of the highest order.” The white suited man stated.


“Black magic, eh? Come along with us, boy.” One of the stewards said as the others dragged him off without evidence nor motive because stewards are ust boat police, and we all know what police are don’t we? Say it with me…a fascist arm of the government, unfit to serve or protect. Well done kids, gold star.


Florgo looked back at Kellan as he was taken. “You must go without me when you are ready, I won’t put my own needs before the rest of the team…”


“Black magic?!” Hallgrim scoffed. “We have known Borego for six months now, he isn’t capable of anything more exciting than a fart in his sleep.”


HUM13 tapped Hallgrim on the shoulder. “I think you are mistaken, his name is actually FLORGO, Hallgrim. And as far as you fellows are concerned.” He pointed at the stewards. “an attack against him is an…”


Florgo reached into his jacket and pulled something from within. As he muttered words that came out of his mouth but were not in his voice, his eyes flooded with a black ink that swamped the sclera and then ran down his cheeks. Florgo threw a glass object to the floor, where bubbles of purple writhed, forming a swirl of tentacles that reached up to envelop him. The stewards let him go instantly, falling over themselves to get away from the teen as the tentacles dragged him through the decking below.


“...obviously justified action, in the year of our Christian lord 1912.” HUM13 finished before whistling and swiftly walking away.

Oryx swam alongside the boat, carrying Kellan and Hum13 on his broad back. As they raced alongside, HUM was reassembling himself into a hydraulic lift. “Cabin 14. This seems to be it.” The robo…human said as he consulted his internal schematics he had downloa…read somewhere.


“OK, take us up, HUM13. Oryx, you keep your eyes peeled, Asher and Hallgrim are going to ask around the lower decks if anyone has seen Florgo. Give me an update if you see anything out of the ordinary.” Kellan asked.


“For example a clearly obvious human turning themselves into a hydraulic lift?” Oryx smirked.


“What was that Oryx, I cannot hear, due to the loud wind.” HUM13’s speakers emitted a loud sound of prerecorded wind as he lifted himself and Kellan to a cabin window.


As they entered the cabin from outside the ship to avoid the police waiting outside, Kellan let out a shuddering breath. The room would have been extraordinary, fine mahogany and crystal decorating a room full of the finest furnishings that would make explorers take extremely risky endeavours to reclaim them or even witness them if something were ever to happen to the ship. But instead, the room had been destroyed, like unsafe submarines that plunge too greedily and too deep.


The furniture had been torn apart and shoved to one side of the room so that the red velvet carpeting could be torn up. A symbol had been burned into the floor boards, surrounded by a large circle of what looked like ash.


“This is crazy.” Kellan muttered.


“You’re telling me! Ashes and velvet? Tut tut.” HUM13 declared as he went into the Duchesses’ bedroom. “So last season of the witch.”


“No, you cretin. This is some sort of spell or summoning.” Kellan rifled through the wreckage to find a glass orb which was blood red. “What was Florgo doing in here?”


“Missionary at least.” HUM13 said. “There is so much of Florgo’s DNA in there, the mattress looks like he has been completing a jizz by numbers.”


“HUM13, turn off whatever colloquialisms Hallgrim has entered into your system.” Kellan asked, and with a flick of the head HUM13 was back to normal. 


“I’m sorry Lady Kellan, it took quite a while to remove all the colourful terms for penis from my lexicon. Why would Florgo get himself involved with the black arts?”


“I didn’t.” Florgo said, as he melted away from the shadows and took human form. 


Kellan stood and put her hands on her hips. “Did you just reform from the fucking shadows while you said that?”


“Yes he did, Lady Kellan, I’m surprised you didn't see that, considering you were looking right at it.” HUM13 said.


Florgo held his head in his hands and took a step forward, prompting Kellan to draw a small knife from her garter. He stopped, not believing that she could think he would hurt her. Kellan gritted her teeth. “Not another step, until you explain.”


“I swear by every learned teacher in the Veil, I didn’t do anything to this woman.” Florgo had been crying, the worry over being accused of a crime for two episodes in a row. “She asked me to help her get free of this abusive man who was intending to marry her. She knew I had…hobbies.”


“This isn’t fucking lego collecting or jogging, Florgo!” Kellan whispered in a hiss. “You’re a mage, and you didn’t tell us for six months! We could’ve used your abilities and you kept them secret! What about when Sigfried and Roy thought Oryx would be great in their new act and we had to have a literal magic battle with them? Why didn’t you out yourself then?”


Florgo sat on the floor, tears running down his face. “I promised I wouldn’t until the right time. I swore to the clan leaders when they sent me to you.”


Kellan’s eyes narrowed as she realised another person had been trying to decide what she should do. “When they what?”


“I wasn’t working in that sexbot emporium for the kicks, you know. I was waiting for you. I was sent by the Veil to protect you, to help. But I swore an oath not to tell you.” Florgo laughed a sick laugh. “All I had to do was keep my magic a secret, but then this woman came asking me for help, she said she was under a spell and needed my help.”


“She needed help in her underwear, I get it.” HUM13 nodded, and Kellan huffed a half laugh.


“No. She said she was being abused, that he was controlling her. I helped her break the chains with a simple unbinding spell, and then…” He hung his head low. “I didn’t know what was happening, she was all over me and it was like I was drunk. It’s not what I went there for, you have to believe me. I woke up an hour later and she was gone.”


Kellan raised an eyebrow. She didn’t understand magic at all, but she had heard enough. “It all sounds pretty sus to me, Florgo. We need to talk to the others and Rift out of this place.”


She turned to find a man in a naval uniform standing at the door, a pistol in his hand. He was older, with a neat grey beard and the hat of a member of the bridge crew. He lifted the pistol to point it straight at Florgo. “No, you all need to stay exactly where you are.”

If Oryx, the giant crocodillian splicer, had nipples they would have been hard enough to cut through the hull. He had been swimming around the ship in icy water for over an hour now, and all he had discovered was fish excrement and the discarded cocktail glasses of the rich partygoers on deck. It was tiresome, not helped by the obvious freezing waters that they had entered, nor the growing miasma that had begun to grow around the ship. It was more than mere freezing fog, there was something otherworldly about the mist, something he couldn’t put his finger on. He couldn’t make anything out through the mist except…what was that.


Oryx grabbed the hull by the rivets and hung from the ship for a second, squinting into the mist to see what it was, but he couldn’t make it out. He plunged back into the depths and swam ahead of the ship, only to be confronted with a minefield of small icebergs, floating partially out of the water.

“I’m William McMaster Murdoch, the First Officer of the ship.”  The navy man re-holstered his pistol and shut the door behind him. “I need your help.”


“That went from pointing a gun at us to asking us for a favour way too quickly.” Kellan replied, her hand still on her garter knife.


HUM13 smiled. “I think you are being too hard, Lady Kellan, the uniformed man is clearly a dashing and well appointed gent and could I ask where you purchased that uniform?”


Florgo put his hands together, a glowing orb growing between them. “You’re here to find me.”


The Navel man grabbed a chair and turned it over to sit on it. “Look, I listened to your story, young man, and I believe it.”


HUM13 cleared his throat and stepped forward. “Erm…which part, dear sir…because we have been rehearsing a play in here. About…”


 “About an unbinding spell, and Rifts, and someone who is obviously a steam driven man?” The XO smiled. To his credit, he didn’t look shocked or scared in any way. “I’m the first officer here on the Titanic, but I’m also a member of the Order of the Black Fold, a magical society that hunts down dark magic users.” 


“Well that’s nice and handy for page count.”  Kellan muttered. “But you aren’t on board for Florgo?”


The First Officer shook his head. “No. I don’t have any records of you or your friends. But my order have noticed Lord Chesterton. He’s been leaving a number of dead civilians in his wake, mostly nobility and those of significant power and influence. I’d normally support that, but some of these people could be innocent and he seems to definitely not be. Ever since the Duchess went missing, a weird ominous fog has surrounded the ship that’s causing havoc with the navigation instrumentation. Something is fishy, and a navy man knows fishy.”


Three loud knocks sounded on the door, and Murdoch opened it to find a ship’s steward at the door. He saluted at the sight of the First Officer. “Sir, there’s been another murder.”

“Watch your step mate, it’s a real pea souper down here.” Hallgrim offered a hand to Asher, who batted it instantly away.


“I do not need your help, I grew up in…” She began, before missing her footing and tumbling down the bottom few footfalls of the ladder.


“Yeah, a demon world that apparently didn’t have steps.” Hallgrim said to the pile at the foot of the ladder. “Unless maybe their hooves helped.”


Asher got up with a growl and scowled at her companion before letting him help her to her feet. “Alright, I get it. Why do you always have to be so difficult? One minute you are pain in my backside, and next helpful. Why can you not be predictably jackass?”


“It’s my dichotomous nature. Keeps the ladies on their toes. Where are we now?” They had been scouring the decks, and now found themselves in the bowels of the ship. “From the smell of body odour and desperation I’m thinking…twitch streamer’s basement.”


“This is boiler and engine room. Heart of ship.” Asher trailed off. “Though why it is so foggy down here is troubling.”


A hand reached out and grabbed Asher by the shoulder, and she grabbed at it, trying not to cry out because she didn’t want to show weakness in front of Hallgrim. When she turned, one of the boiler room workers, covered in muscle and grime, was staring back at her. “This place is off limits, lass.”


“We’re looking for a missing woman. Stay out of our way.” Asher warned as she shrugged the hand away.


The man backed off, knowing not to pick a losing fight, and went back to the thick fog of the boiler room. “Alright girl, your funeral.”


“Sorry mate. She’s a bit tetchy.” Hallgrim called back over his shoulder as they progressed through the dinge. The only light came from the massive coal boilers where the black rok smouldered and gave the room a touch of red light.


“Did you just apologise for me?” Asher said.


“Don’t get you ninja stars in a twist, Ash. I was trying to smooth things over with the workers.” Hallgrim sighed. “Look, I know you’re pissed off about having to leave the Sheriff you were splooshing over back in Hicksville, but don’t take it out on me, alright? I’m not your punchbag when things go wrong.”


He stormed off into the fog, leaving Asher behind to stew. She took a few deep breaths, she knew she was wrong, but it had been so hard since they’d left Little Happens. And she knew what was coming soon enough. She hated knowledge of the future, it fucking sucked. “Hallgrim?” She called into the coal fog, or what she had assumed was from the coal. In fact, it was purple, deep purple and almost tingling on her skin.


“Hallgrim?” She called, more frantically, until shadows came out of the fog to confront her. 


Each of them were workers from the engine room, but something had happened to them. They lunged at her clumsily, their eyes a violet colour, and as they descended on her and held her down, Asher saw a figure in the fog.


***


In his cabin, Lord Chesterton lay still on the floor, flayed open and entrails removed in his destroyed cabin.


“Bad day to wear white.” Kellan whispered at the sight of his blood soaked white suit.


“Has labour day rolled round again?” HUM13 asked.


Murdoch and Florgo shared a look and started looking amongst Chesterton’s possessions. The room had been destroyed in much the same way the Duchess’s had, though this time the victim had been spread across the markings on the floorboards. 


HUM13 found a small black rubber ornament, that was shaped like a christmas tree. “This seems premature, Christmas? In April?”


“It’s a buttplug, HUM13” Kellan announced, and HUM13 nodded sedately before putting the item down and activating his antibacterial self cleaning systems.


Florgo found a small book on the man’s dresser, a diary. He gestured to Murdoch.


“Well? Open it, lad.” Murdoch said, as HUM13 came to read over his shoulder.


“There’s a review of a stage show ‘Mary Get Your Hat’.” HUM13 read. “A love letter to the Duchess with lots of loins aching, a passage about how much he misses his dog, one about him hoping the white suit will make him look more manly amongst his friends.” 


“Maybe skip ahead a bit.” Kellan said with a frown.


“Here he talks about transporting the Duchess to the New World for exorcism. There are passages in some ancient language I can’t read, and I’m gifted in the old tongue.”


Murdoch took the book from Florgo. “It’s a cypher. Used by witch hunters.”


“So we’ve been concerned with finding this woman and she isn’t even the victim?” Kellan asked.


“In fact, I think this drawing shows exactly what she is.” Murdoch turned the book to the three of them. A sketch depicted a woman sucking the souls from the hapless people surrounding her. Underneath she was leading the same army of thralls into fire.


“Wholesome.” Florgo said. “So really, I was lucky she didn’t kill me when she took advantage of me…”


“Didn’t you still help a demon in distress get free to kill us all for the promise of getting your dick wet, Mr Hero?” Kellan gave him a look.


Florgo stopped talking.


“So what’s her plan?”


HUM13 took the book back. “From these delightfully talented pictographs - I am 100% against AI art by the way - I think the demon intends to sink the ship and use the souls she will take from the resulting disaster to help her in some way.”


“Oryx here.” Came a voice in Kellan’s earpiece. “Kellan, the ship is headed into a field of ice and I won’t be able to move the ship away in time. I also have not been able to contact Asher and Hallgrim in some time.” 


Kellan turned to HUM13. “You go do whatever you can to prepare for evacuating this ship, they might not believe you, you’re going to have to make it work.”


“Aye, Aye, Captain.” HUM13 saluted, stealing the First Officer’s hat as he ran out of the door. “Yoink!”


“I suppose you want me to find some way to get these icebergs out of the way?” Oryx said.


Kellan thought. “Well, about that, I have a plan of last resort.”


***


Kellan’s Rift took her, Florgo and the First Officer to the engine room, where a dense purple fog was preventing them from seeing so much as a foot in front of them. It was so think it was hard to even breathe.


“This is intolerable.” Murdoch spluttered.


“Yo Leticia, get your demon ass out here and face us.” Kellan shouted into the fog before turning to her confused compatriots.“I don’t think there’s any need for foreplay anymore, especially since Florgo has already taken care of that.” 


“Low blow.” Said Florgo, sadly.


“I think that was her point, Master Florgo.” Murdoch smiled.


“You too?” Florgo shook his head.


“There’s my little pumpkin.” A voice like poisoned honey penetrated the fog, which separated to show the Duchess and her thralls, the boiler room men that were no longer shovelling coal and were instead waiting on her command. At her feet, which hovered slightly off the floor, Ash and Hallgrim were unconscious. Leticia was both alive and dead, her skin split in rents that showed a glowing fire beneath. Her eyes were chalk white, and oozed down her cheeks, and when she moved there was a clicking of the bones inside where the muscle was already wasted away. She looked like Marjorie Taylor Green. Oh that’s it, there was no extra part of that joke, just that MTG looks like a demonic corpse.


“What do you want, demon?” Florgo yelled.  


“My way back into the dimension I was expelled from for being too right wing for a world of demons.” The Duchess explained. “ And with enough souls I can get back there, my evil totally not a demon fart cloud is currently converting everyone on this ship.”


“Why would you say it’s totally not an evil fart cloud?” Kellan asked, disgusted. “Because now it’s clear that’s what it is.”


“That doesn’t matter!” She stomped her foot. “I want power. And I'll kill everyone on board to get it!”


“It doesn’t need to come to that.” Florgo said. “If I give you all my power, you’ll have enough arcane magic to get what you want. So long as you let the civilians go and let them board the lifeboats. You’re still too weak to fight us all.”


Kellan grabbed Florgo by the shoulders. “Are you insane?”


“Trust me, Kellan. I got us into this, I can get us out.” Florgo said. “Just be ready.”


Leticia mulled it over, biting her lip and accidentally tearing it away from her jaw. “And what’s stopping me from just taking the magic and then putting the crew and passengers under my thrall again?”


“With my power, you won’t even need them. And if I’m wrong, you can do just that.” Florgo said. 


“Fine then, loverboy.” Leticia waved her hand and the crew woke up, and Asher ran to Kellan. “I want everything you have.”


“What’s happening?” Ash said, woozy.


“Don’t worry about that. Get them all gone, Mr Murdoch will show you the way to deck. Florgo and I will be right behind you.”


Ash gave her a curious look, but complied, ushering all the crew up the ladders, and lifting Hallgrim under the arm. Once they were clear, Florgo pulled an item from inside his coat.


“This item is the embodiment of all my powers. Once you absorb it, you will have more than enough power.” Florgo put the device into her hands.


Leticia looked at it, and sneered, then pulled it up to her nose and sniffed. She grimaced. “What is it?” She said as she held out Lord Chesterton’s black rubber buttplug.


“Exactly what you deserve you disgusting demon bitch!” Florgo yelled.


“Now Oryx!” Kellan yelled.


From outside the ship, a large scraping noise could be heard. A tearing within the ship as a block of ice tore into the ship that instantly let a deluge of water into the engine room. As Leticia screamed her last scream, Kellan Rifted Florgo and herself to the upper deck, watching as the wave of water obliterated the demon.


***


The rest of them reassembled on deck an hour later, where the ship was already beginning to tilt backwards into the sea, but the survivors were sedately queueing up in calm lines for the lifeboats. As they rounded the side of the ship, they saw HUM13 and some band members playing a jaunty tune that seemed to be calming the passengers. HUM13 had turned his arm into a trombone that he was wailing on.


“What are you doing?” Oryx asked with a smile. 


HUM13 took a break from playing the trombone to explain to his friend. “I heard that music soothes anxiety, but that did not work, so instead I have searched my databanks for a tune that makes the passengers want to get off the ship as soon as possible.”


“What is it?” Asked Asher.


“The most obnoxious song in the world - Kool and the Gang's Celebration.” HUM13 smiled. However I have some bad news. Most of the lifeboats are already taken, and there are still  1517 passengers and crew that will likely die, including us. On the plus side though I got my revenge on that cheating ho, I threw her over a door and told her it was big enough for two. Knock knock, who’s that? Hypothermia bitch!”


“Jack!” A voice screamed in the distance. HUM13 played the sad trombone noise.


Kellan closed her eyes. She let the space under the boat tear apart from the water, and could feel a Rift opening under them.


“Are you sure you can do this, mate?” Hallgrim asked.”This’ll be the biggest one you’ve done.”


“I watched Florgo fool a centuries old Demon with a rubber buttplug, he isn’t upstaging me today.” Kellan said, as blood dripped from her nose.


As the last lifeboat left the ship, the RMS Titanic seemed to break in two, and both halves sunk instantly below the waves.


***


A week later, Florgo and Kellan sat on the banks of a large sand dune, in the shade of the wreckage of the RMS Titanic. The passengers and crew had already come to terms with their fate, and HUM13 and Hallgrim had shown the settlers how to use the wreckage to build shelter in the dessert. They would be ok here, nomadic, but happy, on the planet that would one day become the heart of the Veil. She would put the wreck back as soon as they had stripped it of all it’s usefulness. Let it be a mystery for too rich fuckers to kill themselves trying to gawp at. Twats. 


“Did you know this would happen?” Kellan asked her friend.


Florgo looked up, it was nice to be home. Odd but nice. The sky didn’t look the same, and the stars were in the wrong place, but it was a millenia or so before he was even born, so it was to be expected.


“No.” He smiled. “The person who sent me said that the fate of the peoples of the Veil would be at risk if I didn’t help you. That it had been passed down in our holy book.” He took the book from his pocket, chucked it towards Kellan.


Kellan opened the book to find a set of suggestions on how to live free and happy. The only kind of holy book she could believe in. She skipped to the end. It was signed Wrath.


THE END.
