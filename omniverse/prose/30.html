	“Extree, extree. Read all about it. Senate building destroyed this morning in suspected Reap terrorist attack. Eighteen Inner Circle members from the Union, Velit, Norn and Ilima presumed dead. Social Media is a blight on humanity and should be eradicated. Trans rights are indelible and inarguable. All police have been subverted into a fascist authoritarian arm of the government. Any other exposition to occur naturally through narrative.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim passed the small boy handing out downloaded news files to passersby via the chips in their subdermal implants. As he tried to offer a download to Hallgrim, he held his hand up. “No need kiddo, I lived it.”
</p>
<p>
	The Norgaard cyborg moved against the throng of mourners numbering the hundreds, all trying to rubberneck to get a look at the absence of a building. Why did people flock to tragedy so much? Hallgrim could think of a hundred other things he’d rather look at, boobies, butts, front butts, Oryx getting smashed in the face with a large mace. With a thought, he scanned the crowd, then looked up to the roof where their enigmatic Reap friend was waiting. She had been asked to hold back by Wraith, but was far too stubborn to be told what to do. “I thought Wrath asked you to get to ground quickly?” He said, his finger activating the comms link in his ear. “Last thing we needs is a panic over Reap on Ilima.”
</p>
<p>
	“I needed to see what we had wrought, and to get some more air.” Reap muttered. “What Wrath lacks in interior design, she also lacks in air freshing spray. The ship smells like inside of Validar Sex Bear’s morning movement. And if you’re going to draw attention to yourself with that finger in your ear, drool a little too so that people are convinced you’re the braindead moron I think you are.”
</p>
<p>
	“This braindead moron needs to check we’re all ok with what just happened.” Hallgrim muttered under his breath. “Eighteen people are dead because of that bomb, and I was the one who shut down the detection net.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx’s echoing growl told Hallgrim that he was still in the sewer systems beneath the city. “And I secured our safehouses, and our Reap delivered the payload to the contact. We all share equal blame. “ He cleared his throat. “Or equal praise if what Wrath told us is...”
</p>
<p>
	“It is true, Reptile” the Reap interrupted. “Wrath doesn’t lie. Now let’s shut our faces, get to our respective hideaways and wait for instruction, before we are caught by the roboticops.” 
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim sighed as the two others turned their comms off. He wandered through the crowd and into the market on his way to the hideout Oryx had secured for him, a small room in a small Hub Sanctuary. Figured that Oryx had sorted him a Norn friendly place, but dear lord, Oryx would be sitting in a Velit dust bar or sex house, avoiding all the pleasures and acting like a little poindexter, probably reading a book while he could be getting his scales sucked, or doing the longest lines of nose sherbet he could fit up his long snout. All the while, Hallgrim would be bored out of his skull at what was the equivalent of a car charging point for boring dickheads who were now more machine than humanoid. There was probably some poetry about them being more at home in the others culture, but fuck it, that would mean understanding Oryx a bit better, and who had the time for that? He scanned his database for the nearest watering hole and came up empty given he was in the galactic version of Quaker town.
</p>
<p>
	“Hey, handsome, name’s Princess. See anything you like?” A robotic voice came from an alleyway in the Norn market, and there at the mouth of the corridor was a Velit twilightress who was advertising her own mouth and corridor with a lack of subtlety Hallgrim found refreshing. 
</p>
<p>
	“Like you wouldn’t believe, love.” Hallgrim said. “Do you perhaps know of the parietal pulloff?”
</p>
<p>
	Princess shook her head, her dark red hair cascading over her red shoulders as she did. Hallgrim hit his internal bypass switch, sending what passed for blood from his brain down to his nether regions. “No, but I’m willing to learn. Anything to get away from the boredom of this senate stuff. Politicians have done nothing to help us, let them all burn I say.”
</p>
<p>
	“Well, then you’ll be pleased to hear eighteen of them are gone. It was a phase bomb I hear.” Hallgrim stuck his arm around the woman, surprised at her odd boniness. “Nothing’s left of ‘em.”
</p>
<p>
	“How do you know that, stranger?” Princess smirked.
</p>
<p>
	He tapped a robotic finger against his nose. “Got me sources.”
</p>
<p>
	“Take him.” Princess said in a stern, robotic voice as she straightened up, pushing his hand away from her. As robotic hands came from the alley shadows to drag Hallgrim down to the floor, the woman unzipped her Velitean skin suit to reveal the roboticop beneath. It reached from behind its back to grab a fake red beard and police badge which they quickly attached. The badge read HUM13.
</p>
<p>
	“Humie?” Hallgrim read before being knocked out cold by a robotic foot.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Kellan Amray’s father, Korvis - leader of Ilima, father of four, pretty mean dancer, collector of Sploonsball cards (Ilima’s 52nd highest national pastime after thumb wrestling), and reader of notable ancient poets, The Beastie Boys - was dead.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan stood in her mother’s chambers with her brothers, Rin and Targus, her eyes focusing on the rich red carpet but not really looking at much of anything. Rin stood in front of her, head buried into her waist and arms around her legs. Kellan looked over to Targus, who was trying to be mature despite having to bite his lip from stopping it from trembling. 
</p>
<p>
	“Yes, Minister Greywood, a sad day.” Etti Amray, general of Ilima and the childrens’ mother, nodded to the hologram of the First Minister of the Unionised Planets, Jiran Greywood. He stood in green and black robes, his first lady and Chief Scientist, Umbra Greywood beside him. “We’re pursuing any suspects to the full extent of the law.”
</p>
<p>
	“Never mind that Etti,” Umbra said softly. “We didn’t call for a report, we called to check how you all are.” 
</p>
<p>
	Kellan loved Aunt and Uncle Greywood, two of her parents biggest supporters. They were regular visitors at Felidar, the Amray’s home in the last months of the year, Frost and Snow. They spent holidays with them as children, as the Greywoods had no family of their own and liked the chaos of a family celebration.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s horrible, Umbra. It feels as if a Rift has opened inside me.” Etty could barely keep the emotion from her voice as she looked at her children. “I’m most worried about the kids. They loved Korvis so much.” Targus sobbed silently at the statement and Kellan grabbed at his hand. He immediately interlaced his fingers with hers and squeezed it tight, recomposing himself. All past insults and aggravation were forgotten - their father was dead, they needed to stick together.
</p>
<p>
	“Keep those wonderful children close, Etty.” Jiran said, his voice low. “We’re on our way to the spaceport right now, we should be with you a day or so before the Norn Technarch or the Queen of Velit arrive to sow their usual discord. “Stay strong, my friend.”
</p>
<p>
	The holo faded and blinked off, and Kellan watched her mother breathe a deep sigh of relief. “Thank fuck that's the last of those calls. The Technarch called to explain that death is just energy going from one state to the other, and that just set off my whole day. Korvis would have said…” 
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly, she realised she was talking to three recently bereaved children, and swept them up in her strong arms. “I’m sorry. Your father loved you all very much, and so do I. Are you all…” She gave up on saying ‘ok’ and just took a turn grabbing each of them and kissing their foreheads. “We will get through this, I promise.”
</p>
<p>
	She grabbed Kellan by the shoulders, not speaking until she returned her gaze. “You were right, and I’m sorry. We should have brought you home earlier, but we worried you might be a target of something like this.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan tilted her head. “But why? Why would anyone want to hurt the family?”
</p>
<p>
	“Wrath can tell you everything.” Etty looked around, not noticing Kellan’s obvious fury at the Pillar. “Speaking of Wrath, she should be here.”
</p>
<p>
	“At a family mourning?” Targus seemed shocked. “I know she is loyal but surely…”
</p>
<p>
	Etty turned to Targus and put a hand to his shoulder. “Wrath loves this family more than anyone. Trust me, Targus.” She spoke to Kellan. “Did you speak to her when you went to Barbarous…don’t lie, I know you went there.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan shouldn’t have been shocked at her mother’s knowledge of her activities, it had been impossible to smuggle boyfriends, girlfriends or any sort of drug into her room without the General knowing and ultimately berating her for her efforts. “They want me to train with them. They said something about me and the Rif…” 
</p>
<p>
	Etti put a finger to her daughter’s mouth. “You and Wrath will share things that no one else can hear about. And she will hate and love you more than anyone else except for your mother.” Etty smiled. “Go find her. Be a friend to her, she will need you today, my strong girl.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan hugged her mother fiercely, turned and left, throwing a wink to Rin as she left.
</p>
<p>

<p>
	“So what is our next step to extricate our simpleton ally?” Oryx tried to steeple his fingers in front of his mouth only to give up as he couldn’t reach the front of his snout. He picked his spoon from his discarded lunch bowl and bent it with a slight push of his thumb.
</p>
<p>
	The Reap sharpened her small boot blade on a whetstone, then sharpened that whetstone on a smaller whetstone before putting it away. This was the third knife she had sharpened. The woman loved blades as much as she hated Hallgrim. “We leave the man-chine to rot. Maybe the Roboticops will find some better use for his corpse. Maybe filing-cabinet or pencil case.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx stood and walked over to her. “You can’t possibly be serious? He’s a integral… I mean a useful…” Even with his intellect, Oryx couldn’t ascribe a word to Hallgrim’s potential for fucking up. “He’s a member of this team.”
</p>
<p>
	The Reap stood, knife in hand. “You think this coming here with big frame and gnashing teeth and bent spoon and sewer stink intimidates me? Back off, or I will skin you and make a few clutch bags to sell to vapid Velit whores selling wares.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx exhaled deeply and closed his eyes, he had no desire for another fight with Slashy McStabby. He raised his hands. “A bent spoon is not a suitable nor intended weapon. I’m merely flummoxed that you don’t want to retrieve a teammate.”
</p>
<p>
	The Reap sat, her eyes narrowing, satisfied but still suspicious. “Hallgrim was stupid and got himself caught. If we rush to free him, we risk the entire Roboticop force coming down on us faster than they did on Robotney King. (Is this funny or tragic?) they only operate in binary, ones and zeroes, guilty or guiltier, purposefully hung in custody or shot in street.”
</p>
<p>
	“I know.” Oryx said. “But considering what we know about our Norn friend and his ability to obfuscate the truth, and natural tendency to brag, how long before he accidentally gives something away we might not want coming to light, our contacts, for example?”
</p>
<p>
	The Reap chewed the inside of her cheek, then stood and threw the table over petulantly. “Let’s go.” She grumbled.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim sat on an uncomfortable chair, at an uncomfortable table, with uncomfortable cuffs holding him in place in the dark room. As the lights flicked on and the door opened, he shielded his eyes with one hand, only for the connecting chain to pull his other hand, his opposite side of his body slamming into the table.
</p>
<p>
	At the open door stood HUM13, his police badge and obviously poor halloween pirate beard still attached. Though now, he had a clip on tie that was magnetised to his neck. “I have seen all the cop movies known to man and will not be fooled.I hope you’re not feigning injury to ask me to take off those cuffs and subsequently seduce me.”
</p>
<p>
	“What are you talking about, I’m not trying to seduce you…”
</p>
<p>
	HUM13 threw his head back and attempted an approximation of a laugh, but it sounded like someone screaming in a centrifuge. “HA…HA…HA…HA…HA. Do not try and tempt me with your feminine wiles. You are female, aren’t you?”
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim skewed up his face. “No! I’m a Norn man.”
</p>
<p>
	“I knew you would break, like all criminals of cowardly subsection!” He slammed a hand down and smashed a hole in the metal table. “I am Sergeant Humie, the legitimate humanoid in charge of the Roboticops. Come on, bro to fellow bro, you are guilty, affirmative?”
</p>
<p>
	“I ain’t guilty of nothing, matey.” Hallgrim sat back in his chair and tried to cross his arms, only to realise he didn’t have enough slack in the chain and then sat back at the table. “Except of maybe having too many sexual partners.”
</p>
<p>
	“Yes, we have certainly all had sex. Inappropriate wink mode activated!” The robot was clearly mad. Hallgrim watched as he pulled a handkerchief from a compartment in his leg and brought it to his face. “Ah, Ah, Ah, SNEEZEHYPHENSOUND.MIDI! You professed some prior knowledge of the bombing of the senate building, and on balance of probability 62%, I deduce with my humanoid gut instinct.” He hit himself in the stomach, making a loud clang that reverberated around the room. “That you are somehow involved, given the reports of a Norn techcriminal that busted out of prison three months, two days, fourteen minutes, and fifty six seconds prior to this moment.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m telling you, Humie, you’ve got the wrong man.” Hallgrim shook his head, then watched as Humie tried to loosen his tie, fail, then just demagnetise and then magnetise it two centimetres lower. It wasn’t an act - this Bot really thought he was a humanoid, and that gave Hallgrim an in. “But sometimes, robots just lack the emotional intelligence to see past a person's looks or potential past and treat us with bias. Don’t they…fellow organic frieeeeend?”
</p>
<p>
	Humie looked surprised by the comment. “Yes, I too have experienced prejudice by my fellow officers who mock me for being human. It has led to a lot of misunderstanding.” Humie looked at his own hands with suddenly red eyes. “Those units do not get that I have a deep and tragic backstory that makes me want to protect fellow organic life. And I’ll do that, even if I have to destroy every filthy humanoid to accomplish that goal! KILL MODE ENABLED.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim raised his hands gently. “Woah, Humie, no need to be angry. How about you and I cast off the shackles of our oppressors and be free? You can be part of my crew, what d’ya say?”
</p>
<p>
	“I say,” Humie stood and pulled a pistol from his non-handkerchief compartment and pointed it at Hallgrim, who flinched. The sound of a gunshot and the sudden release of his cuffs followed, as the chain was blasted free. Humie went to blow smoke away from the gun but as he had no oxygen in his non-lungs, just an electronic noise simulating breath, the smoke gathered around his head.  He then placed a pair of shades over his face, but as he had no nose for them to rest on, he had to pull them back up as they slid down to his chin and hold them in place. “Let’s blow this cop-sicle stand.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Kellan exited the taxipod and checked the address again, then read the sign on the lawn of the small, unassuming cabin that read ‘Trespassers will be violated by a spiked Warhammer’. Wrath, a Pillar of Ilima, the chief Warmonger of the planet, who spent most of her time in royal palaces or touring the galaxy, lived in a ramshackle little wooden cabin in a quiet part of the wooded glens of the south continent. Kellan closed her eyes and checked her privilege. The cabin wasn’t small, it was big for one person, and in a beautiful setting…it just…wasn’t Wrath. That was what bothered her the most. Wrath was a dick of the highest order, who lived to be in and around people just so that she could cave their fucking faces in. This dainty shit wasn’t for her.
</p>
<p>
	She walked up to the oak wooden door and knocked loudly. 
</p>
<p>
	“Fuckov.” Came the shouted, slurred, response.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan pushed open the door, to find a dark, completely trashed room, the curtains in what she assumed was the lounge all drawn to block any light. Kellan stepped to the window and drew the thick curtain back, only for a glass to come careening past her face and smash against the wall into shards.
</p>
<p>
	“Isaid fuckov.” Wrath sat in the middle of the floor, surrounded by broken items and furniture. Her helm was off, though her thick auburn hair covered her downed face. 
</p>
<p>
	“Do you have many visitors, Wrath?” As Kellan walked around the room, she saw framed pictures like in history holos everywhere. Pictures of her parents, her siblings, Asher, even pictures of Kellan on the wall. She realised that to Wrath, Kellan’s family were her family too. As close to family as Wrath might ever get. She went to a dresser and picked up a picture in a frame of Kellen holding a baby Asher. “Oh Wrath, I didn’t know I meant this much to you. This picture is pride of place, right next to…what the hell is this?” Kellan picked up a long wooden cudgel that had been stamped with black lettering.
</p>
<p>
	“That’s Babe Ruth’s Walkoff Grand Slam vs White Sox bat from 1925, I got it on a mission.” She didn’t even look up, swaying drunk.
</p>
<p>
	“And this?” Kellan picked up a rusty but high-tech-looking laser pistol, its handle emblazoned with a lion roaring a cannon out of its mouth.
</p>
<p>
	“That's the last gun of the Dukes of Lead, picked it up in a neighbouring reality about 400 years from now.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan didn’t even try to understand and put the picture, the gun, and the cudgel down. She looked on the floor to find a small, furry cylinder and picked it up. “What the hell is this?”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath pulled her helm halfway over her face. “I went through a Rift and ended up hunting evil cryptids across 50s America for a while. That’s bigfoot’s dick.” 
</p>
<p>
	Kellan screamed and threw the furry phallus across the room, where it landed in one of Wrath’s half finished drinks. She wiped her hands down her front and shuddered, before she looked over at Wrath, who was stirring the drink with the dick and then downed it. “So you guys weren’t bullshitting, the Rifts lead through time and space? Does that mean Asher co…?”
</p>
<p>
	“Not this, not now.” Wrath stood on wobbly, baby deer legs and moved over to Kellan, she grabbed her by the shoulders and pushed her towards the door. “Go away, Rook. I can’t with you, not today.” 
</p>
<p>
	Kellan wriggled away from her and picked up a long wanded weapon from the floor and brandished it at Wrath. It was otherworldly, and as Kellan pushed the switch the device throbbed as it powered up. “Hey, you owe me for all the lies over the last year! Mother sent me here to check on you, and now you’re going to talk to me about what is happening with me or I’m going to use this weapon on…what the hell is this thing anyway?”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath sighed. “That’s my vibrator, Rook.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan dropped it in disgust and was just about to shout at Wrath when she noticed the streaks running down Wrath’s face. “Have…have you been crying? About my dad?”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath said nothing, but was quick to pick up her vibrator and put it away in a drawer.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan stared at her, feeling about as shitty as a dickless Bigfoot. “I didn’t realise that we all meant that much to you, I thought it was just a job to you.” 
</p>
<p>
	Wrath’s eyes flashed under the helm and her teeth set in a snarl. “Get out. You selfish, hate filled piece of shit.”
</p>
<p>
	“No.” Kellan stood defiant and terrified. “I know you’re hurting, and you know I am too. But the General wants us to stick together. She thinks we’re going to need each other.”
</p>
<p>
	“They are few, but there are days when I hate Etty Amray.” Wrath said, her lips trembling as if she might cry again.
</p>
<p>
	“I need to know about these Rifts, why they’re linked to me.” Kellan reached for Wrath. “And I can’t get those answers without you.”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath looked at Kellan’s outstretched hand, before the holo-imager suddenly cut in. It was one of the Royal Guard standing in the armour of a Captain. “Lady Wrath, one of the bombers has been caught and is being interrogated by the Roboticops. Should we take custody.”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath stood and…nothing. It seemed for a minute that she hadn’t heard, and Kellan was just about to ask her if she was ok when she answered.. “No. I will take custody.” She turned to Kellan. “But you’ll have to fly.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	The Reap pulled her skin mask up and tucked it into her hood, she hadn’t taken the skins off for weeks, it felt so strange to be without her hunting skins, but there was no way Oryx could walk the streets without being as suspicious as a giant crocodile approaching a police station could look. 
</p>
<p>
	She had resolved to kill Hallgrim at some point, maybe after this mission with Wrath was complete. Though useful, his lies and aptitude for getting himself in trouble made him as useful as that decade old pack of condoms your mother keeps in the drawer in her nightstand. I mean, come on Bridget, if a man puts that expired old meat sheath on and climbs on into the dust museum, he’ll shrivel up faster than that Donovan guy at the end of The Last Crusade. Maybe the Reap would gut him slowly, maybe she’d smother him. Maybe she would just download a shitty compressed Soundgarden album from Limewire and watch him slowly die of the cyborg variation of terminal syphilis.
</p>
<p>
	“I’ll be in section 13, directly under the cell block.” Oryx came through her earpiece. “As soon as you make the distraction, I’ll extricate our friend.”
</p>
<p>
	The Reap heard jets descend behind her and turned to see Wrath’s ship, Gloombreaker, touching down about forty metres away. As the disembarkment ramp lowered, Wrath descended…with Kellan. The girl was no older than eighteen, her reddish brown hair a mess, her gait that of an angry teen whose father had just died. The Reap felt a lump forming in her throat. They hadn’t seen her yet, and she needed to stay out of site.
</p>
<p>
	Wrath brought her wrist comms up to her mouth. “ What do you mean, gone? How did he escape?”
</p>
<p>
	The Reap turned away and put a finger to her ear, pulling her hood and Reap mask down into place as nonchalantly as she could. “Oryx,” She whispered. “Abandon the mission. No questions.”
</p>
<p>
	“Who’s Oryx?” Said a voice behind her. As she turned, Kellan stood, hands on hips behind her. The girl caught sight of the Reap skin and went to grab her, but Reap was faster, and put her in a hammer lock before forcing her down to the floor. The Reap gazed towards Wrath, who looked up from her call, her mouth an O of shock. 
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	The Reap ran, and Kellan was straight after her like a Boomer to a 4pm dinner service, chasing her down the alley past the police station and through town. Gods, she was fast, and as fit as Kellan was, she could barely keep up with her.
</p>
<p>
	They zigzagged through the gatherers in the market square, past the afternoon lunchers from the financial district, until Kellan heard a beep from her wrist comms. “Kellan, disengage. She could be dangerous.” Wrath shouted.
</p>
<p>
	“A Reap? On Ilima? There’s no way she doesn’t have something to do with Dad’s death!” Kellan said between deep breaths.
</p>
<p>
	“Just hold on, don’t do anything rash! We can’t…”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan cut her off and turned the wrist comm to silent. She wasn’t about to potentially let her father’s murderer go because Wrath was hungover. The Reap climbed on a tramtaxi as it lifted away and jumped inside, pushing the driver out to the floor. Kellan sprinted, following the hover car to the edge of town, over the restricted airspace of the shuttle port before she pulled the Duke of Leads laser pistol she had snuck out of Wrath’s cabin. She aimed the pistol and fired,  the gun shorting in her hand but firing an uncontrolled burst of plasma that hit the tramtaxi and brought it down to the flat concrete with a smash.
</p>
<p>
	With burning hands, Kellan sprinted to the wreckage and pulled the woozy Reap girl from the driver’s seat. “You took everything from me!” she bellowed into her bloody face, tears blurring her vision.
</p>
<p>
	“Look who’s talking.” The Reap said, punching Kellan in the stomach so hard, she fell to the floor gasping for air. Kellan reached for the woman moving away from her and screamed with every ounce of anger in her soul. Reality tore away and she felt a sensation of the very flesh shifting away from her bones, her fury at her father’s killer pulling her away from herself. It was electric nails on a razorblade chalkboard, her entire soul felt like it was covered in papercuts, and her bones shook like a booty at a Lil Kim gig circa 2001.
</p>
<p>
	The Reap stopped in her tracks as if held there, and as Kella looked up, she saw why. About a metre in front of the Reap, a green tinged shimmer floated in nothingness. The ragged edges of the Rift in the very air fizzed and seemed to be burning the oxygen around it as the woman backed away from it, terrified.
</p>
<p>
	“No. No…” She muttered, raising her hands in front of her horrified face, eyes wide. “I won’t go back. I won’t.” 
</p>
<p>
	Kellan looked at her own hands, both knowing that there was no way she could have created this Rift, and knowing that she absolutely did. The Reap shrank and became like a child at the sight of the opening, and fell back onto her butt as she kicked out to crawl away.
</p>
<p>
	The two of them were vaguely aware of a ship touching down behind them, Kellan heard a familiar voice telling her to stop. But rage drove her, and she stood and marched towards the Reap as if the very heat from her own anger had lifted her off the floor and was guiding her. 
</p>
<p>
	Kellan stood over the Reap woman, realised from her lower face that she wasn’t much older than Kellan herself, the tears running from behind her mask making her look much younger. A hand stretched down to her, and Kellan didn’t realise at first that it was her hand reaching down. The Reap took it and pulled herself to her feet, the heat from the Rift behind them burning against their backs. 
</p>
<p>
	“Rook, no!” Wrath yelled.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan turned as if in a dream, and watched as the Wrath, a giant crocodile man, a Norn cyborg and a robot wearing a fake beard were standing not ten feet away, looking at her in shock. 
</p>
<p>
	“I thought this would be difficult. But looking at you again, I realise how much I’ve missed you, Kellan.” She pulled her mask over her blond hair, and when Kellan looked into the eyes of her baby sister, she wondered how she hadn’t recognised her mouth, the shape of her jaw. It was the face of a dying child that had shrank away from her like Hans Gruber in Die Hard. It was burned onto her psyche. 
</p>
<p>
	“Asher?” Kellan gasped, scanning her face, looking at the 15 years that had been added.
</p>
<p>
	Asher looked down, and Kellan’s eyes followed, they were holding hands just under Asher’s ribs, and as her sister pulled their hands away from her body, Kellan saw a blade she was holding slip from Asher’s abdomen. She watched the dark red patch grow on her sister’s Reap skins, and for the second time in her life, Kellan Amray - called the Rook as a duel insult to her adopted heritage and her awful luck - looked into her sister's dying eyes and realised she was to blame.
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
