	“Well this place is a complete bag of rancid horse dick, Emmeth.” Grissom sneered at the smell, the brimstone stench getting in his nostrils. It permeated everything, the whole barren planet stinking worse than a car full of Gwynneth Paltrow’s vagina candles that white women with too much money think they need. Here’s what you really need - fucking perspective, Karen, Shawna, or whatever your basic fucking bitch name is! If you’ve got enough disposable income to buy a Goop candle with someone’s happy juices in it, then maybe put your spare money in a food bank or something, you deluded twat. Anyway, it stank, and Grissom was having none of it. “Seems like a fitting place for a Technomancer to live, or unlive, what’s the terminology here?”
</p>
<p>
	“You having second thoughts, brother?” Emmeth hacked his way through the thick undergrowth of the swamp with a machete, using his other hand to waft away the flies that swarmed around him. “This is what we want, right? To kill it?”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m not nervous. I’m just trying to work out the smart play here. Blotch, Taber and the others couldn’t take this thing down back on Ithia, and we’re less people against more evil scumbag now.”
</p>
<p>
	“It’ll be a cakewalk, Griss.” Emmeth stopped and turned to Grissom, giving him a wink. “You remember that time Jaxon took us to Revalli? Told us we were being made men and sent to that pleasure house, but it turned out the manager was a ten-tentacled Draylok shapeshifter who was feeding on the clientele? I’ve never seen my dick shrink faster, and I once tangled with a Werepolarbear in the ‘natural shrinkage not a small dick, honest’ mountains.”
</p>
<p>
	“Guys shouldn’t be allowed to name mountains.” Grissom smiled at the thought of his old mentor. “I remember you running out holding your unmentionables looking more scared than that girl you asked to the Saint Murglin’s Eve dance.”
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth laughed. “I had more chance of gettin lucky with the Draylok!” He hacked at the brush, and found a clearing of dead growth leading to a stone door. “Looks like we’ve found our dead thing to kill. Or kill again.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom’s smile vanished. “Yeah, I reckon you’re right.” He said.
</p>

</p>
<p>
	Mookie ran their fingers over the sleek tablet they had fought to have forged. It was a beautiful slab of obsidian, covered in a steel frame, a prophecy tablet unlike any they had ever seen. It was nothing like the quartz and stone tablets they had polished in the Mothman Propheseer’s conclave, but why would it be? This was a totally different reality, with different rules. The only universal constant seemed to be that the police were a fascist arm of government control. ACAB in all realities.
</p>
<p>
	The temptation to use it right now was almost too much. To channel unfocused, raw prophecy for the first time and have the skills to interpret it? Mookie had been the Omniseer for a long time now, but bar a few readings and interpretations, they had never really fulfilled their purpose. But this was it, the key to understanding the path of the universe and, if necessary, changing it. They wished that they had had the tablet to preempt some of the mistakes they had made: being too hasty to grow up, not saying goodbye to Death’s Head or Father Flicker, buying a ticket to see Batman Vs Superman at the players house, not telling Doots they loved her earlier.
</p>
<p>
	“How many times can you use it?” Doots had been playing while Mookie had been thinking. In fact, all of them were in the room, with Blotch and Ludwig prepping their weapons on the table of the transport. Blotch had hammered nails and pieces of broken glass into the cudgel and was currently painting a frog flipping the double bird on its length. Ludwig was pulling small arms out of the endless pockets of his tactical - but plaid - waistcoat: knives, grenades, a set of nail clippers, some small plastic swords from Pop Up Pirate, and a few airfix models he had tried to affix knifes to. He loved building weapons and models after all.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s dependent on the focus. The bigger the prophecy, the weaker the tablet will become. Given that we’re about to try and find out how to save the universe, I imagine it’ll take everything this one has.”
</p>
<p>
	“So we got ourselves a glass cannon.” Blotch looked up from her cudgel modding. “If we use it too quickly, and the Technomancer changes plans, it’ll be as useless as balls on a dildo.”
</p>
<p>
	“An’ if we use it too late, it’ll be as pointless as Dean Cain’s acting agent.” Ludwig used more tape on his airfix model. “A tricky predicament to be sure. So when you thinking?”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie stroked the tablet with their forelegs, and an image flashed quickly in their mind like lightning. An image of a slender, beautiful moth. “Death’s Head?” She whispered, confused, as the tablet slid from her lap and fell to the floor.
</p>
<p>
	Doots was there to catch it and looked up at Doots. “You ok? What happened?”
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t know, but something bad is about to happen.” Mookie looked Doots straight in the eye. “We need to get there fast.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots started playing the intro to Cowboys From Hell by Pantera, and a portal opened. “Well, let’s go be heroes then.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	The large group of Harvesters advanced, firing blasts into the cavern, which Tamia ducked and dived over with ease. At times like this, Tamia thought she had maybe missed her calling in life, she could’ve been a catburglar, or a pole dancer. The tips would certainly have been better, and the clientele only marginally worse. The lead Harvester, a cretin named Tibo, who had spliced his organic frame with a pneumatic drill, shuddered as he shouted after her.
</p>
<p>
	“W..w…w…ill y..y..you st..st..ay still, y…y…ou j…j…umping j…j…jezeb..bel!”
</p>
<p>
	Tamia threw the sword in a spinning arc, a sock attached to it. Hijoki ignited the sword as it entered the crowd, holding a helicopter of death in his mouth and slicing Tibo (thankfully so none of his dialogue needed to be written out again) and three of the other pursuers in half.
</p>
<p>
	“Good shot, stinky!” Tamia shouted, sliding in Risky Business style and grabbing up the katana to finish off those that were still somehow alive.
</p>
<p>
	Three of the remaining Harvesters turned tail and ran back down the stone-walled corridor at the sight of the barbarity as Tamia started hacking and slashing. The trio had already taken a pretty heavy beating, leaking lubricant fluid from most of their orifices. As they turned the corner and got clear of the advancing Tamia, a shadow dropped in front of them holding two pistols. The shadow wore a long duster jacket with an upturned collar, and the Harvesters took a step back apprehensively.
</p>
<p>
	“Graves…” One whispered under their breath.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh wow, you think I’m Grissom?” Lionel stood, looking pleased with himself. “You hear that guys, they thought I…”
</p>
<p>
	“Focus up, Kid!” Hijoki shouted from further down the cavern corridor.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel shook himself back into character and put on a deeper voice that only occasionally cracked. “Hey, looks like you’re leaking puss there, brobot. Have you been kissing your mother’s gonorrhoea laden front butt, after I slept with her last night? Wait…no that’s not right, I’ve mixed up two insults there. Tamia, what was my line again?”
</p>
<p>
	“Just shoot them, Lionel!” Tamia chastised from around the corner. “This isn’t a meet and greet!”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh yeah!” Lionel shot one Harvester in the elbow crease, forcing his arm to smash back into the other and slap him across the face. As the two went down in a tangle of machine and wires, the last charged at Lionel, who dodged a punch that smashed loudly off the cave wall with an echoing clang. Lionel shot through his tricep with a blast of plasma that made his arm hang from his shoulder by a few strands of sinew. The Harvester howled and fell to his knees. With the three of them on the floor, Lionel turned his guns on them and spoke slowly.
</p>
<p>
	“The crew I travel with would kill you, but I’m going to give you a chance to earn your freedom. What’s the Technomancer’s plan?”
</p>
<p>
	One of the Harvesters shook his head. “No way man, he’ll kill us if we do.”
</p>
<p>
	“We’ll keep him too busy for that. Plus, what do you think my friend’ll do if you don’t tell us?”
</p>
<p>
	“What is this, some infantile play on good cop, bad cop?” The Harvester spat, feeling Tamia approach behind him.
</p>
<p>
	“There are no good cops. We’re more, shooty cop/decaptitaty cop.” Tamia said.
</p>
<p>
	The laser katana ignited close enough that the sweat dripping off the technomancer’s forehead sizzled and steamed as it hit the blade. Hijoki got in the Harvester’s face. “Spill the beans, or spill your intestines, lad, it’s no difference to us.”
</p>
<p>
	“We’re in a holding pattern, we’ve been told the cowboy’s going to be taken care of today.”
</p>
<p>

<p>
	Grissom had been walking for what felt like days - but whatever, he wasn’t a fucking wuss or anything, he was just sayin’ - but when the sound of his own heavy and manly footsteps stopped echoing back at him and started resonating, he knew something was up. Turning the corner, he arrived in a large, domed room in the cave structure, Emmeth already taking his pack off as he stood in the centre. The carvings in the wall depicted some massive fight, a confrontation between the dead and the just. As he looked harder, he noticed depictions of himself, Blotch, Doots, Ludwig. But there was no resolution to the battle, it rotated the room and seemed to stretch forever. By the time he got around to where he fought he had began, the carvings had changed somehow, as if to suggest the fight would be eternal. Also weirdly, there was a carving of a dog eating a bag of peanuts, like a walking on hind legs, human looking dog. He was wearing a T-Shirt that said ‘I Honk For Bitches’ on it. He turned back to Emmeth, his Queer Eye for the Bounty Hunter guy moment over for now.
</p>
<p>
	“Hey, you see that dog eatin…”
</p>
<p>
	A blast hit Grissom in the guts, and he doubled over, sinking to his knees. He reached for his stomach, then pulled his hand away to reveal the red, sticky liquid coating his fingers. “Why?” He grimaced.
</p>
<p>
	“Because I am with the Technomancer, you fool. He raised me from the ground when I was cold in its embrace, brother.” Emmeth walked around Grissom. “Admittedly, most of his reanimations have no memories but for what he gave them, and I was no different. But when you were all at the WayStation, your fears, your memories were transferred to the Custodian, and the Technomancer stole them. He knows everything about you, Grissom, and he gave all that knowledge and hate back to me.”
</p>
<p>
	“Whelp, that explains it!” A voice came from the otherside of the room. “We wondered where you got the memories from.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel walked out of the shadows, two pistols in his hands. “You ok, Grissom?”
</p>
<p>
	“Hunky Dory.” Grissom said as he stood, towering over Emmeth.
</p>
<p>
	“How did you all know?” Emmeth sneered.
</p>
<p>
	“Because I know how my brother really died…” Grissom said through gritted teeth. “You got a debt to pay, ‘Emmeth’.” Grissom used air quotes.
</p>
<p>
	“Well done buddy, you used them right this time!” Lionel beamed.
</p>
<p>
	“Lionel.” Grissom warned.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel nodded and looked abashed. “Oh, yeah, pathos. Sorry.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Flashback Time, people! HarpEffect.midi!
</p>
<p>
	Lionel had known from the start that this imposter couldn’t have been Emmeth Graves because Grissom had told him the truth long, long ago. It was a truth that the Duke of Lead hadn’t been comfortable admitting to anyone else, and the lie that he didn’t know what happened to him all those years ago was so practised it had almost replaced the truth. In regards to the Waystations scanners, they apparently had.
</p>
<p>
	After Jaxon had died, the young Dukes of Lead who had escaped the Technomancer had split, to avoid detection, and Grissom and Emmeth had would up on a planet in search of Harvesters. They found a conversion centre, where kidnapped innocents were being converted into Harvesters for the Technomancer’s armies.
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth had always been a questionable Duke of Lead, he wasn’t cut out for it in so many ways, and Kalandra, Grissom, and the others had always pushed him along into something he was never ready for. And this was the day it’d caught up with him. They liberated the camp easily, and were about to evacuate when a whole dropship of Harvester reinforcements touched down. Grissom told the hostages to flee without them, ushering them through the forest and back to civilisation as the Graves brothers led the Harvesters in the opposite direction. And then Emmeth gave them away accidentally, and the Harvesters came for them.
</p>
<p>
	For six days they were tortured and beaten, only to be returned to a cold cell every night. Emmeth was about to break. Grissom had given him the pep talks, the comfort, the resolve to keep going, but Emmeth was running on empty. And one night, after a teary Emmeth apologised and said he couldn’t take any more, and was about to give the hiding place of the hostages away, he begged Grissom to kill him. Grissom pleaded with him to hold on, to be strong, but in both their hearts they knew Emmeth couldn’t. Grissom found enough strength to do what was necessary and damn him in the process. To kill his own brother. Two days later, an opportunity to escape arose, and Grissom slaughtered every Harvester he could find, saving a hundred lives in the process.
</p>
<p>
	All it cost him was everything.
</p>
<p>
	Years later, as his dead brother stepped off the shuttle ramp on the Conveyance of Grissom Graves 2, Grissom shared a look with Lionel and a plan was formed, messages passed silently. Lionel would pretend to be petulant - it wasn’t a big leap - until Grissom could find an opportunity to order him into the hall to discuss out of earshot.
</p>
<p>
	“Grissom, you told me Emmeth…” He whispered.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom exhaled, it was all he could do to hold it together. “I know, I know. It’s got Techno-fucker written all over it. That’s not my brother.”
</p>
<p>
	“But…he obviously doesn’t know we know that.” Lionel smiled. “Can’t we use that? Flush out the Technomancer’s plans by letting Emmeth do a bit of breaking up of the band, all the while leading us to the Technomancer?”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom put Lionel in a headlock. “You goddamn little genius monkey.”
</p>
<p>
	The rest of the crew were informed during the fake secret vote on whether Emmeth should join the crew, and Grissom admitted to them what he had done, and how he had known that Emmeth wasn’t Emmeth. The crew did something he wasn’t expecting - they accepted him, understood him, forgave him.
</p>
<p>
	Then the crew was split, each with a task, leading each one right…back…
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Here.
</p>
<p>
	“I have been given some of the Technomancer’s powers, two of you can’t hope to take me down.” Emmeth spat, holding his pistols towards the two men.
</p>
<p>
	“Jesus dude, have you never seen a superhero movie before?” Tamia and Hijoki were bathed in red as she ignited the sword.
</p>
<p>
	“Hero? You cut that Harvester’s dick off and shoved it up his…” Hijoki smirked.
</p>
<p>
	“Ah, ah, ah, don’t spoil our big entrance.” Tamia warned. “Where are the others?”
</p>
<p>
	A fizzing light opened behind them, and Doots, Mookie, Ludwig and Blotch stepped through, taking positions around Emmeth. “Sorry we’re late dear fellows, we wanted to make sure we were loaded for bare faced liar.”
</p>
<p>
	“A touching reconciliation, but the numbers are a little light, eh? I took two of you with me.” Emmeth grinned, knuckles white as he gripped the pistols. “And now my Master can do the rest.” He pressed a button on his belt buckle of a bull with a shotgun, only for an electronic refusal to sound in return.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, bless your dead heart.” Ludwig laughed, rubbing his tentacles together.
</p>
<p>
	Heath stepped from the tunnels behind them, carrying a large canister of black ink. “I imagine this must be highly embarrassing for you, but you’re not the shot you think you are. Also it’s quite easy for me to block your communications. And subsequently track them back to your overlord.” He threw the canister across the room, where it shattered against the stone floor with a loud smash. The pool of black inside reformed instantly, Taber stretching his long talon ended arms as if he had bones and muscles to warm up.
</p>
<p>
	“And the Oscar goes to! Next time, you lot can get in the canister. I was built to spread, baby.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’ll make the next shots count.” Emmeth pointed his pistols at Taber and fired only for them to hit him and do absolutely nothing.
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t worry, Emmeth.” Blotch narrowed her eyes. “Statistically a lot of men fire blanks.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom snatched the pistols from his dead brother, then tore the Duke of Lead sigil from his coat and turned his back on Emmeth. He went over to Mookie. “Let’s get you back to the ship and protect that tablet.”
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t you walk away from me, Grissom!” Emmeth screamed in the dark.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom didn’t even look back, but passed the pistols and sigil to Lionel, and hit him on the shoulder. “Good to have you back, brother. I hope you don’t mind taking care of this for me? I can’t…do it again. I changed the ammo back to live rounds, by the way.” Grissom wiped the red corn syrup off his shirt and smiled at Lionel. He turned and picked up Mookie, putting them on his shoulder and giving Doots a nod. She created another portal, and the pair walked through it and back to the ship, the sound of Emmeth’s screams following him. “Grissom! He’s waiting for you! You’re dead!”
</p>
<p>
	After it closed, Blotch swung her cudgel straight into Emmeth’s face. “You’re one to talk. Batter up, ugly.”
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth stumbled backwards, but shook it off and jumped clear, only to be met by Doots, who made solid notes that flew towards Emmeth as she ran down the fretboard with her finger. Each one was a solid high pitch note like a set of glass shards. The shards flashed past his skin, tearing small pieces from him.
</p>
<p>
	“Pointless specks!” He hissed as he pulled a shard from his chest, green tinged dust spitting from the wound.
</p>
<p>
	“I must confess I’m slightly offended, sir.” Ludwig slithered towards him, climbing up his body as Emmeth stabbed at him with the shard, only puncturing himself in the process. Ludwig twirled around Emmeth and jumped off him, smiling as he pulled a detonator from his pocket. Emmeth patted his frame, finding small mines all over him. The dead man lunged, but Ludwig pressed the button, shaking him with incendiary blasts that stopped him in his tracks and covered him in smoke.
</p>
<p>
	As nothing but screams pierced the smoke, Heath turned on his infrared vision and stepped into the fog, pulling Emmeth up off the floor and throwing him into the clearing. The flesh had burned off his face to reveal a partially decomposed skull - the real Emmeth. Taber followed up by pinning him to the floor with daggers of obsidian. “Gross. You Dukes of Lead might be slicker than jizz on an otter’s neck, but if you get pinned down, you ain’t all that.”
</p>
<p>
	“You can’t treat me like this, I’m Emmeth Graves!” The thing screamed, as Tamia slashed at the ghouls mouth, making him look like a poorly put together puppet. He tried to talk, but just made gargling wet noises, spitting blood all over his front.
</p>
<p>
	“No you’re not. You’re nothing but a spectre.” Lionel said as he raised the pistols to Emmeth’s head. “But that doesn’t make me any less sorry this had to happen. I hope you find your rest, Emmeth.”
</p>
<p>
	The gunshots rang out loud in the cavern, and it was done. “We should burn the body.” Hijoki offered. “Give what he once was a proper burial.”
</p>
<p>
	“Yes.” Heath nodded. “But first, Ludwig and I have some examinations to complete.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	“And that’s how I became a Duke of Lead.” Lionel beamed, holding a pint glass aloft, though it was filled with water because he was already high on his own self aggrandising and didn’t want to overdo it.
</p>
<p>
	Blotch got up from the dining table of the Swiftfeather and took her plate to the sink, rolling her eyes. Doots stood pretty quickly after. “We know Lionel, we were there.”
</p>
<p>
	“You didn’t have access to all the details of what we all did as independent teams, though.” Lionel was still smiling smugly. “Now it’s all been woven together like a real story. A story where if there was an audience out there somewhere, they probably got fooled that Taber and Heath were really dead. It’s like there’s a real narrator here, and maybe he got amused by people saying he was bloodthirsty and wanted to teach them all a lesson by toying with their emotions.”
</p>
<p>
	Taber pulled a face. “Wow, that’d be a dickish thing to do, to toy with your creations and your audience in that way?”
</p>
<p>
	“Shut up, he might hear you.” Lionel whispered, looking around, suddenly nervous.
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig’s voice came on over the ship’s internal comms.“Could all available crew kindly mosey to the medbay, please?”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	“Alright, what is it?” Mookie asked, staring at the metal contraption that Heath was showing them, aware that unless it was some amazing new sex toy, three quarters of the crew would soon lose interest.
</p>
<p>
	“It is an implant we found in Emmeth.” Heath said proudly, but when nobody clapped, he went on.” It was implanted by the Technomancer in order to project the relevant lifesigns onto a lifeless corpse. I’m sorry Mr Graves.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom shrugged. “No need to be all ‘pologetic about it, Bot. Someone dug Emmeth up, someone needed to put him down again. It was a kindness to my brother that you all obliged.”
</p>
<p>
	As ineloquent a thank you that it was, everyone felt a warm glow realising that they had done good here.
</p>
<p>
	Blotch was first to break the silence “So why call us down here? It’s not going to do much good now, guy’s dead again.”
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig smiled. “Because, Blotch, we finally have an opportunity to turn the tables on the Technomancer and put our crew back together.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	“Stop picking at it.” Doots said over the transmitter in Lionel’s ear, as he furiously scratched at his itchy neck in the cockpit of the Bar’Thur shuttle, checking his reflection in the viewscreen. He certainly looked the part, Emmeth’s black coat and hat fit him pretty well, and the guns completed the look.
</p>
<p>
	“Easy for you to say, you haven’t had a zombie’s gross implant stitched inside you. I’m going to get necrotising fasciitis.”
</p>
<p>
	Doot’s sigh was heavy. “That was cured.”
</p>
<p>
	“What about botulism?” Lionel asked.
</p>
<p>
	“Cured.” Mookie was with Doots and it was clear she’d taken over talking to Lionel so Doot’s didn’t have to open a portal and slap him across the face.
</p>
<p>
	“I must be able to get some disease?” Lionel looked at himself in the mirror, convinced he was turning green. He started to tug at the skin under his eye, but a tentacle shot out from Emmeth’s coat, which turned out to be Taber in disguise.
</p>
<p>
	“I suppose the bacteria could theoretically speed up your potential for male pattern baldness?” The Darkling sniggered.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel hopped on the spot, pulling at the skin at his incision site. “Get it out, get it out now! That’s worse than the others!”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re so vain you think that’s worse than a flesh eating disease?” Mookie said over the earpiece.
</p>
<p>
	“Yes!”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie tried her best to be patient. “Look Lionel, this is the only way we can get Ellie back. When you saw your future with Ellie, Doots and I, you saw yourself joining the Technomancer. Isn’t this better than you thought it might be?”
</p>
<p>
	“I wasn’t really looking for an alternative way to join up, to be honest.” Lionel sat in the pilots’ seat, and checked the scanners. There the ship was on the sensors, it was go time. “So this implant is going to convince the Technomancer’s sensors that I’m putting out the same signal as undead Emmeth did?”
</p>
<p>
	“Genius, eh?” That was Ludwig, proud of the Frankenstein he and Heath had created.
</p>
<p>
	“If only he didn’t have eyes, eh?” Taber joked.
</p>
<p>
	“He is teasing you, Lionel. The Technomancer has no eyes, not in the way organics do.” Heath said. “Even to me, you appear to be Emmeth. It is unsettling.”
</p>
<p>
	The proximity warnings went off in the cockpit, and Lionel brought the rear viewscreen online. “You want unsettling, there is a giant cock shaped ship coming right behind us. I don’t know whether it’ll take us aboard or fuck us to death.”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch tutted. “Alright, alright, as soon as you dock with the ship, we’ll start to lose you, so take care of yourselves and stick to the plan. Rendezvous in four days, ok?”
</p>
<p>
	“Remember I want my epitaph to read ‘Lionel Richie - a bigger penis than everyone thought’.”
</p>
<p>
	“So 2 and a half inches, right?” Grissom muttered.
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer’s ship was above them now, the clanking and clattering of the bay doors opening all around them. The shuttle was enveloped in the darkness. “Oh fuck, oh fucking fuck.” Lionel muttered.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom came back on. His voice was deadly calm now, but the radio ad started to crackle. “Remember Lionel, you gotta be like a real Duke of Lead if you wanna fool that Technomancer. Be suave, be sexy, be menacing. Uh…be anything but you, ok?”
</p>
<p>
	The shuttle bumped down, landing in the shuttle bay of the Technomancer’s ship, and suddenly the whole shuttle felt frigid and cold. It was as if the very life was being sucked from the ship.
</p>
<p>
	“Emmeth…” As the Technomancer’s voice seemed to scratch at his very bones, the shuttle ramp began to open slowly. Taber wrapped tighter around Lionel, bulking him up and keeping him warm. Lionel patted the shapeshifter in thanks. He got up and walked towards the green light of the bay. As he raised his hand to shield his eyes, the first thing he saw was thousands of pairs of green eyes stare up at him. Thousands of beings, from hundreds of worlds. The Technomancer had raised each of them from the dead. And there, at the head of his army, the Technomancer walked to Lionel and Taber, with the swagger of Tamia’s dad, the indestructible shell of the slaughterer of the Dukes of Lead, and the pure evil that chased Taber and the rest from Ithia. He was somehow worse like this.
</p>
<p>
	“Emmeth. Have you completed your mission?” His voice was shiver inducing, as if it reached inside and grabbed at his very bones.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel just stared, paralysed in fear, and Taber had to shake him to get him to answer.“Uh…yes, master. Graves is dead, he was easy to dispatch really, his miniscule mouse brain and small penis were really easy to overcome. None of the others suspect.”

	The last message to come from his earpeace was Grissom loud and clear. “I’m going to kill you, Lionel.”
</p>
<p>
	“The crew have been split. They are easy to pick off now.” Lionel shuddered at the realisation of how near they had actually come to that.
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer tilted his head. “You have done well, Emmeth. We will send you out again with an army to wipe the others away. For now, rest.” He waved a taloned hand towards a door and Lionel obliged, walking away as swiftly as possible without looking like he was running.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel and Taber searched the corridor beyond until they came to a lab where the heat emanating from the door made them stop. “It’s a lab.” Lionel said. “I don’t know how I know, but she’s in there.”
</p>
<p>
	“Let’s shelve the talk of your creepy, Mookie-esque clairvoyance powers for now and find our friend.” Taber whispered.
</p>
<p>
	The lab, such as it was, was actually banks and banks of screens, their cabling covering the floor to such an extent that Lionel had to tiptoe between them. Each monitor showed other universes, the images flicking from one world to another every half second. There was a universe where The Dukes of Lead were lead by a woman Grissom, where Blotch and Taber had morphed into one, terrifying being. Embarrassingly there was one where Lionel was just sitting in a computer chair in his underwear scratching his balls. The sheer amount of infoormation was dizzying. In the middle of the room, connected to the monitors, the watch sat. Ellie’s watch. He ran to it, whispering to it as if to wake her, then reached out.
</p>
<p>
	“Ellie? Ellie, it’s me Lionel.”
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly he was hit from behind, sent to the floor. As he looked back, dazed, a hologrammatic woman stood in front of him. She was beautiful, and Lionel instantly knew who it was simply by the way she held herself. “Ellie?”
</p>
<p>
	“Nice try, I know Lionel and he’s not so zombie.” The hologram said. “I mean he does have a certain odour, but nowhere near what I’m register..”
</p>
<p>
	“Odour? You described it as a musk!” Lionel said, hurt.
</p>
<p>
	Taber separated himself from Lionel. “I didn’t want to say anything, kid, but you are a bit ripe. You need to grow up and stop using Axe bodyspray. Ellie, it’s us.”
</p>
<p>
	Her demeanour changed instantly. “Taber, Lionel, how is this possible? Why do you look…undead?”
</p>
<p>
	As Lionel was still looking at her, confused, Taber took the lead.  “Some Heath and Ludwig techno jiggery pokery involving Grissom’s dead brother. C’mon Ellie, we have a plan to get you out of here.”
</p>
<p>
	Ellie stood straighter. “I’m not going, I can’t. You guys shouldn’t have come here.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel couldn’t believe what he was hearing, they had sacrificed so much to save her, and she was saying ‘no’. “Why?” He demanded.
</p>
<p>
	“Because I’m the only thing stopping him from resetting the Universe.”
</p>
<p>
	The door to the lab opened with a woosh, and outside in the hall the army of dead waited as the Technomancer sedately walked into the room and looked Lionel dead in the eye - I mean how else could he look him in the eye, ammirite? No, I’m not leaving the podcast.
</p>
<p>
	Taber lunged for him, his arms rotating saws, but with a simple flick of his hand, the Technomancer sent Taber flying back into the monitors. “It’s been a long time, Darkling. I don’t wish to fight you.” The Technomancer smiled.
</p>
<p>
	In response, Taber liquified and pushed himself through between the metal panelling of the walls and out of the room.
</p>
<p>
	“Find him.” The Technomancer said over his shoulder, and in response his entourage ran down the corridor with a horrifying screech (the noise, Dustin Diamond wasn’t there).
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer stepped into the room, the temperature instantly dropping to the extent that Lionel’s breath was visible. It reached a taloned hand down to Lionel, who looked up into the chrome skull of his enemy to see his own terrified face staring back at him in his reflection.
</p>
<p>
	“Hello Lionel. I’ve always wanted to meet you.” He smirked.
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
