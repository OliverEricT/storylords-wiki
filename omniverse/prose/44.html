S2 Episode 18 - Beastmaster 3: Riftaken Identity - A Frankenstein P.I. Mystery????


Prompts: Dicks and Dominatrixes


By Rich Masters



From the Case Files of Adam Frankenstein, Private Investigator

New York, New York, Winter 1934, Entry ...


…the pen trails off the paper as what passes for brains in my patchwork quilt car wreck of a head takes a wrong turn at Albuquerque. The last few blood-soaked days have been messier than David Caradine’s marionette show themed bachelor party, and to tell ya the truth, I don’t even know where to begin this case file. Well, maybe I do, maybe it was that embossed leather business card that came sliding under the door, the one that looked like it was deliberately wipe clean only…


A fluffy pink dressing-gowned Adam got up from his chair where he had been reading a newspaper, detailing a wave of robberies and a spate of suspicious grisly murders of gangland thugs who’d been worked over more than the Completionist’s tax returns. The article wasn’t of much interest to him, some mob guys getting their just desserts wasn’t exactly something to get the kazoo out for, let alone violins. He let the broadsheet drop to the desk, causing the small folded magazine of Women’s Bare Ankles Weekly he had been actually reading to fall out of the newspaper and to the floor. Look, he had an understandable affinity for random body parts, ok? Adam sometimes wondered if it was weird that his arousal sent blood to some random dude’s dick, but considering technically it was another man’s blood and another man’s hand he used to do the deed, the ethical ramifications didn’t bother him enough to go cold choked turkey.


Bending down and cursing the twinge that shot through his knee - he wasn’t old, it was the man’s leg he used that was old - he grabbed at the black card and turned it over in his grey fingers. The gold lettering was striking against the black leather, and read: ‘The Musty Holster Club - VIP Black Tie Event - 1:00am’, along with the address and today’s date. Adam’s ears pricked at the thwomp, thwomp of heavy footsteps on the wooden panelled hallway outside his office, and he opened the door to see a massive hulk of a postman shuffling towards the elevator. 


Annoyed at the invite to an obvious trap, or worse, another bullshit case that would lead to no money and some sort of monster mashacre, he snarkily called after the postman for clarification. “Hey, gorilla my dreams, you the courier who brought me this? I didn’t know Western Union started taking applications from the zoo!”


The mass stopped, turning slowly. The green and scaly snout of a giant crocodile turned back to look at him, and Adam recoiled, uttering an expletive that I won’t repeat for fear of harming his Saturday morning cartoon potential, and reaching for the thing he always did when he was confronted by something he wasn’t expecting, the handcannon he had tucked into the waistband of his briefs. The crocodile man simply stared, drool dripping from his teeth, as if he lacked the brains to lick his own lips. He’d either been sucking the business end of an opiate pipe harder than your mother sucks pipe for gas money or maybe just cos she’s lonely, or there was some sort of mystical whammo jammo happening here, either way, a hideous predicament.


With a cautious step, he approached the gargantuan reptile and waved a hand in front of his face, feeling the usual affinity he did for giant monsters. “Hey, Mac, you ok in there?”  he said. In the silence of the hallway, you couldn’t exactly hear a pin drop, but you could all of a sudden hear a single note quavering on the air. Adam’s head was filled with a foggy voice he could almost make out, something he’d heard before. But he shook his head and refocused to find the crocodile’s eyes angrily glaring at him.


The crocodile spun and Adam saw the thick green tail a millisecond before it slammed into his stomach and threw him backwards to the wall behind him. He cracked the painted finish and slumped to the floor, sending plaster raining down on his head. Adam re-tied the chenille, faux fur gown, picked up his pistol and aimed it down the hall, but his assailant was long gone. “Damn speedy for a walking handbag.” he muttered as he picked up the business card which had fallen by his feet. “Time to rent me a monkey suit, and not the gorilla gram costume I had to buy when I fought that gang of super smart apemen.” He said to the empty hallway as clarification and to prompt Jeff to write more Adam Frankenstein mysteries.

Oryx looked up from the alley at the glorious testament to men who had small penises everywhere, the newly built Empire State Building. He sighed contentedly. “What a marvel of Art Deco design and architecture.”


HUM-13 pushed his long trench coat collar up and pulled his hat brim down to cover his robotic features. “The kid’s statement amused me, buildings on Ilima dwarfed this one. The No Limits sexatorium alone is 270 floors of hot, steamy action according to the intrusive advertisements I used to pick up on my radio antennae.”


Oryx smiled and patted HUM-13 on the back. “I recollect my first time observing this building, Humie, the first time I visited New York. Seeing it, this place, it was a balm to my soul after the destruction of the colony. It was the last place I came as a free man before returning home and starting my self imposed incarceration.”


HUM-13 detected a small tone in the distance, but he ignored it. “The kid told me he had been in the big house, the cooler, old chokey, the old ‘place you get sent to when you commit a felony’. I was more shocked than when I’d mistaken a charging port for my dame in the dark. He’d always seemed the tall, scaly and dangerous type that could sweep a toots off her gams, even though he sounded like he’d downed a thesaurus cocktail whole and went back for a dictionary chaser.”


A series of skittering screeches could be heard, and the pair of them suddenly turned to watch a wave of brown New York rats rushing down the alleyway, carrying gems, wallets, contraband and cash. Behind them ran a fox dragging a bag full of police issued pistols and shotguns. As the fox saw them, he gave a finger gun, winked at them, and then said “You ain’t seen nothing, capisce?”


HUM-13 hummed, louder to counter the pitched ring in his auditory sensors. “It wasn’t the type of fox I had wanted to walk into my life, hoping for one with hair hotter than my nuclear core and legs as long as my programming code.”


Oryx winced, his jaw setting. The piercing noise was getting louder. “How…Chandleresque of you…my friend. I…urghhhh…coming here, will help me understand…erghhhh…”


The pitch settled on a solid, earsplitting tone and Oryx suddenly stopped mid-sentence. As his eyes glazed over, a thick line of drool descended from his mouth and he turned and staggered in the direction of the southside docks in the midnight air. HUM-13 looked down at a bag the rats had dropped, turning out in his hand. Small, crystal clear gems cascaded onto polished metal. “Uncut, pure, diamonds. Like angels tears, or small pieces of compressed carbon. You don’t find this sort of clarity outside a fine jewellers, or a serial polygamist who loves engagement parties, right kid…Oryx…Oryx?”


He looked down the street to find his friend staggering off, and decided to follow at a distance, to practice his covert, sneaking style, which was largely tiptoeing and telling passersby to shush.

The maitre’d turned the card over in his hand with sneer barely disguised by his poncy soup strainer that was thinner than Adam’s last nerve. “And who exactly you say gave you this invite, sir?”


Adam’s teeth gnashed together like gravel, and the sound made the colour drain from the prick until he was whiter than an Arkansaw school marching band. “I told ya’s already, Ask Jeeves, some Creature from the Black Bayou dropped it off and then tried to slam me into next week. So why don’t you goose step to one side and let me in before I punch your mom in the jaw and give you an adultcircumcision?”


Little Lord Stickass moved in a flop sweat and got his two heavies to open the door, and Adam made a mental note (because the three piece he was wearing from Sideways Sal’s Substantial and Sizeable Suits didn’t have pockets big enough for his notebook) of the muscle on display here and walked into a ballroom packed with New York’s male elite, male celebs and male sports stars mixed with male politicians and even more unsavoury male characters, if that could be believed. A carefully started fire could wipe out most of the New York scum  and misogyny tonight, but then what would Adam do for work? The room on the other hand had a classy elegance, with wide double staircase at the far end of the room leading to a stage where a giant clamshell stood open. Inside the shell, a woman lay across a bed of naked men, clad head to toe in leather with random titillating windows cut out of the leather to show what Adam first thought was pink skin. On prolonged inspection, the flesh was blue tinged as if they’d pulled the woman out of the Hudson, patches of scaled flesh and her eyes a couple of wet and clouded marbles bulging from the leather and zipped-up gimp mask she wore.


“Admiring the scenery, Mr Frankenstein? It is a beautiful set up here, isn’t it? a voice seemed to come out of nowhere, and Adam looked around before feeling a tug at the hem of his black dress trousers. He looked down to find a small, plumpfaced mobster with shark-like features circling him.


“Does Batman know you’re here, Oswald? Or wait, is Snow White missing a henchman? I assume you're the eighth one - Impotent.” Adam smirked, pleased with his quick wit and understanding why he didn’t have many friends.


“Walk with me, Mr Frankenstein.” The clearly peeved man swirled his martini, as he sauntered along, Adam annoyingly having to walk in pigeon steps to not outpace him. “The name is Boopi Di Beppi, I’m one of the heads of the Five Families.”


“Sorry for the lack of surprise, I left my shocked gasps back at Sideways Sal’s when he told me the deposit of this rental, which given you’re probably about to turn into a Mothman or some shit, I suppose I’m not getting back now.” Adam followed, but found himself distracted by a scene playing out across the room, as a guy in a trenchcoat was trying to drag the crocodile he had tussled with earlier away as he marched across the room to the staircase. The Reptile was dressed differently, but there was no doubt it was him.


Beppi laughed. “You think we brought you here to fight? If we wanted you dead, we coulda just whacked you in your office, or that hoagie place you frequent twice a day, or that twilight pornography cinema you frequent when you can’t sleep.”


Adam stopped. “If you think stalking me like a lovesick teenager is intimidating, you ain’t familiar with some of my body of work, Bumpo, or whatever sad Italian clown name you said. I’m a literal literary monster, ok? I don’t scares so easy.” The trenchcoat guy had now been stopped by security, and Adam felt the sudden urge to help another Dick who was just trying to do his job. 


“We’re here to hire you.” Beppi smirked before finishing his drink and passing it to a waitress. “We’re on the brink of something big here…”


Adam waved his hands in front of him, to stop Beppi. “Woah there, Tony Smallprano, I don’t work for the mob. Whatever hussle you gots going on here, I want no part of. Except maybe some of those delicious looking canapes, it’s been a few days since I ate anything but peanut butter from the jar.” 


“No, no, no, Adam. We don’t want to hire you, we have some innocents to exploit and we want to pay you to look the other way. To take a break from your endeavours.” Beppi smiled again, the sorta smile that made Adam want to cave his teeth in, and he gestured to one side, where the crocodile from outside his office, still in his postie uniform, had approached, he held out a briefcase and opened it. In it was small stacks of pilfered, blood splattered money - there must’ve been five grand in there, enough to retire to cabo and die surrounded by fine liquor and finer lickers.


Adam’s eyes narrowed. “Oh my little meatball, in a New York minute, you’re gonna wish you’d stopped explainin’.”

HUM-13 still grasped at Oryx’s sleeve as the mobsters surrounded him, trying to jostle him to one side. He tried to fight them off, eager to not abandon the friend who had not abandoned him at his worst. He sent an electric shock through his body, straight into anyone he was in contact with and sending them flying. Oryx stopped stock still, shaking his head if trying to remove the fog. He looked around, confused at his surroundings, then looked thankful when he turned to find HUM-13. “My friend, what is happening?” he muttered, afraid.


Across the room, a young Oryx was shaking off the fog too, and Oryx and he locked eyes. “No…No…not this…” he muttered before seeing the diminutive shape of Boopi Di Beppi, and snarling. “You. You were to blame for everything I did.”


HUM-13 jumped over an incoming fist and added a strong strip magnet to it on the way through. He then dodged an incoming headbutt and put the magnets’ opposite on his attacker’s forehead. As he activated a button on his chest panel, the fist and head slammed together knocking the man out as he punched himself in the head. “FriendOryx, we must go now. A distinct statistical disadvantage is presented here.” Another first flew his way, and he opened his chestplate so the the man’s arm embedded itself into his internal mechanisms, being broken in fourteen places by the various cogs and pistons that powered him. He released the man and shouted loudly “INCAPACITATE MODE ENABLED.” Bringing out various arms filled with kitchen utensils. He became a whirling dervish of culinary violence, thwanging pots, pans and ladles off mob heavies’ heads and sending them to the ground.


“No, Humie, if I can kill him now, I might be able…” Oryx began, before the giant in the impeccably tailored suit gave the mobster a haymaker that sent him into the bandstand at the top of the stairs. The hulk of a man turned to Oryx, and smiled from amongst a face of stitch and scar. In return, Oryx nodded a thanks to his friend by way of enemy and marched towards his younger self.


“H…how is this possible?” Young Oryx studied the face of his future self. 


Oryx placed a clawed hand on his young shoulder. “Time travel, complicated, backstory, numerous mother jokes I find uncouth, but not enough to be killed for narrative device. How long have you been here?”


He looked into nothingness. “...weeks. I think. The things he has made me do. The murders. Oh gods.” He sobbed. “How do you live with it?”


“I went back to my present and sent myself to prison to atone, to learn, to centre myself. You will recover, you will have friends like, Humie, Kellan, a Norrn called…”


“Hallgrim!” The young one exclaimed. “He and Asher spent time on the colony with me before I came here.”


Oryx was dumbstruck. “They’re alright? Did they escape? I don’t, I don’t remember this.” He wracked his memory, Hallgrim and Asher were never with on the colony, the first he had seen them had been in the prison complex. How was that possible, were they somehow changing time without altering their own pasts? His younger self had only been here weeks, but Oryx knew the abuse, the manipulation in his own past had been years, it just didn’t make sense.


HUM-13 sauntered over to the stitch-faced man and eyed up his giant hand canon, and also his pistol. The man looked him up and down with a puzzled expression. “The man mountain weighed me up, unsure about this gumshoe robot who became a man. Could they be allies, private pugilists, illustrious invetigators, dangerous dicks, both of them with a common enemy suddenly? By the way his name was Humie.”


Adam couldn’t help but smirk. “Adam Frankenstein. Anyone who has beef with this little shitstain is alright in my book. You hear me, Beppi? Come out now or I’ll shove so much dead fist down your throat you’ll think you’ve inherited your dad’s penchant for necrophilia.”


“Oh, if you think you’re dead now, you don’t know the half of it.” Beppi shouted back from the balustrade.


“Not questioning the necrophillia, eh? Slightly weirded out by that, but who am I to judge?” Adam muttered at HUM-13’s shrug.


Di Beppi stood at the clamshell, alongside the blind dominatrix, giving a sick smirk before he unzipped the woman’s mask. A single note that was layered with harmony filled the room, and Adam could feel his free will slipping. He clasped hands over his ears, turning as the two crocodiles seemed to be being whipped into a frenzy, their mouths frothing at the tone. Adam watched as other wild animals - rats, foxes, snakes and the like, waiting on the sidelines and staring, slathering at him like a packed lunch.


“She’s a siren.” Adam shouted over the voice to his new robot companion.


HUM-13 looked around and made a visual assessment, they were outnumbered and outgunned, with no escape route. On the plus side hiis new ally seemed to be somewhat resistant to sirensong. He looked up, then wrapped his entire body around Adam, clipping his hands and feet together like a harness.


“Hey pal, buy me dinner first.” Adam grunted as Humie shot a hook through the skylight above them as the animals advanced, then hoisted the pair swiftly up into the night sky.


Boopi Di Beppi turned to the Siren, who stepped down on the backs of the men with her stiletto heels, a cat of nine tails in her hand. She swatted at the male party guests gently with the whip, licking her lips at their grimaces of pain as she walked down the stairs. She walked to a position under the broken skylight, bathing in the moonlight, her pallid flesh still moist in the glow. 


When she opened her blind, milky eyes, she turned to the two crocodile men she held under her thrall patting them on the snouts as she whispered. “Find them, and bring them back to me, so they might feel my love.”

Adam had his pistol drawn as he kicked the door to the safehouse - a mortuary - open. He had come by the safehouse option because the mortuary assistant had a certain thing for the dead, and that made Adam the Clark Gable of the necro scene. Once they were inside, Humie detached from him and leaned against a cadaver before apologising to it, not registering it was dead.


“What was that Ringling Brothers shit, Humie? We needed to stand there and duke it out, mano a mano, or more accurately giant hole tearing weaponry to siren dominatrix.” Adam threw the gun to an empty slab with a clang.


HUM-13 brought a candy cigarette like those ones our parents used to buy us because ‘hey a kid smoking’ is funny then beat our asses if they ever found weed or cigarettes in our room, and brought it to his open mouth slot. His fingertip flipped open and a flame grew out the empty hole. He brought it to the candy, which instantly reduced to a burnt marshmallow consistency and dribbled down his trenchcoat. He threw his head back and sighed. “Ah, flavour country! The Dick…not in a human genitals way, but in a private eye sense…”


Adam rolled his eyes as he locked and bolted the door. “Thanks for clarifying, buddy.” 


“...didn’t realise that this old, grizzled investigator had lost so many friends already, and couldn’t risk the crazy crocodile partner of mine becoming some sort of seafood broil. We two know that when you put yourself between innocents and the inevitableness of crime, you might well take a bullet - or in this case several bullets from the mob and siren of ancient greece. They were both married to the job, kind of like those weirdos who marry non humanoids like trains, or amusement rides, or Kanye West, but for the two of them it was even more sexua…”


“Humie!” Adam shouted, shaking the prop from The Day The Earth Stood Still even though Adam couldn’t have possibly seen that movie as it wasn’t out for nearly 20 years. “Despite being in desperate need of a bolt tightening, you seem like there’s some brains in that head of yours. They’ll be coming for us, and we’ve gotta have a plan to take them out safely before they get here. I don’t wanna be shocked, caught with our pants down.”


HUM-13’s eye lit up like whenever your mum’s phone rings before she realises it's just some call centre trying to steal her bank account details, and she’s so lonely she gives them over just to have someone to talk to for five minutes. “Partner, you’re closer than a hot day in July. When I gave Oryx the old five finger slowdown, and sent some voltage. He was calm as a turkey on the 26th December, see?”


Pipes gurgled in the back bathroom, but the pair were two engrossed to hear. “You’re saying a large zap might knock the stupid outta them long enough for us to send this living breathing Billy Bass back to the depths of evil she came from - New Jersey Harbour?”


“The dead man walking got it, but he hadn’t pegged that the signal would then need to be constantly blocked. The Singing Psycho could just find another frequency to play with and we’d be on the long expressway back to square one, starting point avenue, state of North beginningsville.”


The clanking of the plumbing became louder, and the pair of them turned. “Don’t worry your tin head about it, Probably just old piping…”


The toilet and sink began to shake violently as the sound got louder.


“...how like build up of pressure up the way can cause weird noises and clanks that…”


The toilet bowl exploded and sprayed them with sharp shards of porcelain, Adam stepped forward and took the brunt of it instinctively, then wiped a firm hand down his front to remove the shards from his body. A crocodilian arm came out from the hole in the bathroom, and two glassy eyes appeared in the dark of the room.


“...Release two angry crocodiles into a formidable safehouse. (Sigh) I ain’t getting this deposit back now.” Said Adam. “You ready with that shock, tinman?” 


HUM-13 removed his hat and put up his dukes, nodding. “But we still need to block their…”


Adam folded his jacket and placed it on the slab, loosening his bow tie. “I know, partner, leave it to me.” He charged at the advancing older Oryx with all the grace of a T-rex doing jump rope, and connected a sock across the first crocodile’s jaw, before hopping his tail and stomping on the younger Oryx, who was climbing from the pipe.


HUM-13 held his hat up to older Oryx’s snout, then punched clean through the brim, poking Oryx in the eyes. Older Oyrx howled in pain. “Why the long face, pal-o-mine?” 


“Less joshin’ and more shockin’!” Adam yelled back, just as he felt a crunching in his arm at the wrist, not really pain, but awareness. When he looked back, young Oryx had chomped clean through his hand, leaving detached fingers still wiggling on the floor. “Jokes on you, scaly, that wasn’t even my hand!” he said as he cracked his attacker across the face. “Humieeeee?”

 

But HUM-13 was being hoisted up over Oryx’s head, the gargantuan beast trying to tear him in two. The totally legit human stayed stock still, not fighting. Internally, his entire runtime was being devoted to a massive shock that would take down an entire city block. He was at 98%.


Then he felt a tear in his servos at his waist, heard the twisting of steel and bearings, and everything went dark. 


*** 


Two halves of HUM-13’s shell and a handless and bleeding Adam Frankenstein were deposited roughly on the high stage in front of the novelty clam shell. The two Oryx’s stood proud with dazed looks on their faces as a leashed Boopi Di Beppi helped his mob Queen down from her throne.


She unzipped her mask, her forked tongue tasting the air as her clouded eyes flicked sightlessly between the forms in front of her. She pulled at the chain around Di Beppi’s neck, and he gasped. With a sharp fingernail, she scratched a thin line of blood down his cheek and licked at her finger. “Urgh. Cheap marinara and cholesterol medication. This thin, male blood is so boring and predictable. But these four specimens….” She stepped over the bodies to inspect the crocodiles. “…men out of time, beasts and constructs I can use to cement control of the five families. To put a woman’s touch on the evil of this land…”


From behind her came a tap on the shoulder, and as she turned, Adam stood tall over her, HUM-13’s torso on his back with his fingers in Adam’s ears. 


“Get them, destroy them my beloveds!” She screamed at the Oryx’s, before noticing the thin slits of tough skin behind their eyes where their ears were (weird research you have to do for Storylords, lemme tell ya) were stuffed with Adam Frankenstein’s meaty digits. She spun back to Adam with a sneer.


“I’m sorry, madam, you’ll have to speak up.” Older Oryx smiled.


“Who has one thumb and is about to turn you into fishsticks, bitch.” Adam brought a thumb and a stumpy hand without fingers up to his head.


The fist that slammed the Siren in the face wasn’t exactly his usual, and it lacked the normal face hole causing power, but the fishy freak went over the side and fell to the floor faster than your mum slut dropping and twerking at the family summer BBQ. She landed in a heap of broken bones, a blue-black blood leaking from her smashed up body.


“And thus the case of the Gimpy Guppy was closed, gentlemen.” HUM13 announced.


“Well fellas, looks like I’m going to mosey on back home, free now from my obvious manipulations by that woman, back to my life of innocence and regular charitable donations…” Boopi Di Beppi started to sidle away as the four men turned to him, before breaking into a run.


Luckily his little legs couldn’t carry him far, and the young Oryx pounced on him instantly. “I’ll eviscerate you, you filth!” he roared.


But before Oryx could punish his imprisoner, the sir crackled and the taste of ozone flooded their mouths. A Rift opened to one side, sucking them in instantly. As soon as it opened it was gone, and the three remaining men were left alone in the ballroom.


As they descended the stairs in silence, Oryx peered over the railing to find that the Siren had vanished. “It appears our Beastmaster has vanished.”


“Don’t worry pal, they all turn up eventually.” Adam shrugged, holding out a stump.


“Like a bad penny.” HUM-13 said before fist bumping Adam’s stumped hand, and causing him to wince in pain.


***


Three weeks later, Oryx and HUM-13 sat in Adam’s cramped office, surrounding a table full of casefiles that Oryx was filing and organising. HUM-13 had  been a revelation in researching and admin, and Oryx handled all correspondence and invoicing clients, leaving Adam to his talents shooting people and public relations. The pair of them had been a breath of fresh air for Adam, who wasn’t used to having…friends? Were they friends? The word sounded alien in his head. He hadn’t had many of those in his long life.


“Finished!” HUM-13 announced as he finished the last stitch on Adam’s new hands, while his third and fourth arms were repairing the dinner jacket rental.


“A new mitt and my deposit back, pay coming in regularly? You two can stay anytime.” Adam said flexing his new fingers, then chewed the inside of his cheek as he turned away looking at the wall. “I mean, you guys can, if you want to, I’m not saying you have to or anything, but now you missed your Rift, there’s a space here for yas.” He shrugged.


Oryx put a hand to Adam’s shoulder. “Something tells me we’ll be vacating soon, my friend. But if we’re wrong, this serendipitous and fortuitous locale is something we could both call our domicile.”


“Alright, Thesaurus-Rex.” Adam said, shaking Oryx’s hand. “We don’t gotta pick out wedding gifts or anything.”


HUM-13 tilted his head. “Plus, there’s nothing stopping us coming back when all our work is finished? If we even get a chance to rejoin our old friends, that is.” 


As if on cue, a ball of purple tinged lightning appeared in the ceiling, and tore open violently. The small room became a maelstrom, casefiles and papers circling in a vortex. Adam gripped the table, and his grabbed at his new copy of Women’s Bare Ankles Weekly, ducking his head to avoid getting hit in the face by the tornado of paper. When the electricity died down, he stood to find his two companions gone.


He looked down at the mess of papers, and the dinner jacket HUM-13 hadn’t finished mending yet.


“Figures.” Adam said, slumping down in his chair and opening his magazine.


THE END
