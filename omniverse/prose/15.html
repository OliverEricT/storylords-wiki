Ep 15 - Storm in Paradise

The lilac-skinned attendant in the regency period waistcoat and tails looked down his nose at the pair that stood before her. Admittedly, they did look ridiculous, but so did everyone at this event. The opening of Lord Admiral Zaxxon Pisney’s new space station colony, Pisneyland (Copyright pending and likely to be turned down.) “Identification?” The attendant muttered.

The thickset man passed the attendant two cards and she swiped them with a long stick that the man thought the attendant might’ve previously pulled out of her ass given her uptight demeanour.

“These are…unusual names…” The attendant grimaced, hoping as she typed the data into her computer that their credentials would hold up about as well as an All Lives Matter argument.

“This better work,” the thin, pale, coiffured young man whispered to the thickset, dangerous looking man beside him. “We spent a pretty penny on these.”

“It’ll work, now try to look like a harmless moron who hasn’t done a hard days work in his whole life. I mean, even more than you usually do, obviously.”

As the attendant scanned the younger man’s ID, a picture of him appeared on the holoprojector. It showed a much meatier man, with a square jaw and piercing eye, not this short pile of what she assumed was a failed cloning experiment of a rhesus monkey with a subscription to the National Enquirer.

“You look different.” she glared, her finger hovering over the security button as she scanned the other man’s ident card.

“The Duke has had a serious case of Deridian herpes. It’s known to cause wastages of the muscle and what our sector’s doctors call ‘yellowbellification’.” The heavyset man interjected and elbowed the smaller man in the ribs, who coughed and waved a silken handkerchief

in front of his chalky face. “Either way, our bio implants should confirm our identities.

She ran the scanning rod over their necks and looked almost disappointed to find the two were who they said they were. “Fine,” she sneered. “Go wait at the top of the staircase and the Master of Ceremonies will announce you.”

They stepped forward.

“That was close.” Lionel Richie muttered, straightening out his wrinkled pink doublet and prodding at his stuck on beauty spot. “She looked like she was onto us.”

“I told you, don’t fiddle with that beauty spot.” Grissom Graves smacked Lionel’s hand from his face. “The forger assured me after I ripped off one of his hands that he’d changed all the details in the registry. The photos could’ve been of a hobo skull fuckin a methhead so long as the bio chips and idents match the data there.”

“Seems counterproductive to rip a hand off a forger when they still have work to do. Wait a second, I don’t remember having a bio chip inserted?”

Grissom looked proud. “I fed it to you. It was either that or use it as a suppository, and this thing was girthier than a prize racehorse on his wedding night.”

Lionel slapped Grissom across the face with his soft cotton glove, and Grissom didn’t react at all. “I knew it! It was when you cooked that god awful stew last week, wasn’t it?”

Grissom looked hurt. “That was my Mama’s recipe! No, I just shoved the bio implant down your throat while you slept. You asphyxiated a few times, but I revived you in the medical bay.”

“That was you?! I kept having nightmares that I was David Carradine.” Lionel stared wistfully off into the distance. “I’ll never tie a knot again. All those years in the scouts, wasted.”

“Still, your ‘Being an A-Class Pussy’ badge continues to come in handy.” Grissom smirked. “Now, all you had to do was submit our names to the Forger, please tell me you did that.”

“Did I! I gave us all the gravitas I could muster.” Lionel’s voice trailed off. “Though…to be fair the forger was quite pushy and you know how when someone asks you for your favourite song you can never quite think of anything…”

“Duke Clint Karate and Mr Rocky DannyTrejo Wolverine!” The Master of Ceremonies announced from a hologramatic scroll. Every one of the hundreds of attendees looked up…then went back to their conversations, uninterested in the two of them.

Grissom tugged uncomfortably at the tie Lionel had made him wear, then looked down at Lionel. “Rocky. Dannytrejo…”

“Yeah I know. I was just trying to think of something cool.”

The room was a celebration of gauche gaudiness, with marble pillars of pure white, white walls, and white floors. White platter laden servants in white suits and masks, so they could float between guests unnoticed - though all that did was hid them against the white background and made them a trip hazard for the mingling guests. The colour came from two sources. Firstly,  the thousands of flowers decorating the tables, walls and pillars. The second from the giant ostentatious portrait of Zaxxon Pisney in a luchador mask that hung above the main staircase. The room looked like a summer debutante ball rather than the launching of a new deep space colony, but Lord Admiral Zaxxon Pisney was flamboyant in style as well as temperament. He once sent an aide to the guillotine for not realising he had peanuts in his teeth even though the peanuts had only got there by Pisney spitting whilst talking as he ate said peanuts . Lionel had also found out that the title of Lord Admiral was as fake as the pectoral and abdominal implants he had had done a few years ago. His family were war profiteers and weapons makers, but Pisney had spent a fortune pursuing his own love - wrestling.

The colony itself was an ex-military orbiting laser defence satellite, owned by Pisney Advanced Weapory as a planetary deterrent against invasion. But now that the wars in the outer rim were over, and the military industrial complex had ruined the entire planet with its war profiteering, Zaxxon had invited all of what he perceived to be the best and brightest (and of course, obscenely wealthiest) to his floating getaway that he had secretly converted into a paradise of revelry, good food and most importantly, no poor people. It was a nirvana, albeit a nirvana with a still function planet-killing laser.

“Oh my god, Grissom! They have little pizzas. Cover me.” Lionel almost screeched as he reached a table, where a small collection of mini pizzas were contained under a crystal cloche. Lionel lifted the domed case delicately and stuffed the seven discs into his mouth. He lowered the case, giving Grissom a thumbs up as he chewed.

“You must be Duke Karate.” A booming, cheerful voice said.

As Lionel turned, looking like a squirrel storing nuts in his mouth, he came face to bare nipple with Zaxxon Pisney, who wore his white flannel shirt open to his navel to show off his slightly plastic-looking, orange body.

“And you must be his business partner, Mr…?”

“Rocky Dannytrejo-Wolverine.” Grissom sighed.

“Of the West-Pelas Nubula Dannytrejo-Wolverines?” Pisney beamed from his neon pink luchador mask. “You must be the son of Lord Schwarzennger DannyTrejo-Wolverine?”

“Must be!” Grissom nodded with an unsure grimace, trying not to look the man in the face.

Zaxxon Pisney gasped, and barged between the two of them, staring at the empty cloche. “Attendant!” He yelled to a white garbed servant who came over quickly. “Where are the delegation from Mozerrelli V? They should be here by now! The poor things have to rehydrate in the cloche before they wake from their hypersleep!”

Grissom turned to Lionel, who was turning green. “You better swallow,” Grissom whispered. “Or you’ll wish your momma had the night you were conceived.” Lionel swallowed the delegates from a world he’d never heard of.

“I bet you have these sorts of shenanigans with guests all the time, eh, Duke Karate?” Pisney straightened and slapped Lionel on the back so hard he spat up a small amount of Mozerrellian that Grissom quickly covered with his boot.

Grissom put an arm on their host’s shoulder and directed him back to the table. “How awful..ly abysmal. I just detesterise when guests are late, or even worse do not RSVP if they don’t intend to show. Don’t you, Lord Admiral?”

Zaxxon lifted an eyebrow, looking his counterpart up and down. “I do, Rocky! Say, would you like to see my collection of rare antiquities? I possess the biggest in the known universe. Collection of course.” He laughed, then suddenly whispered. “And penis.”

“Well…I should…really stay with the Duke here, we need to make a proper eyeballin’ of the errr, facilities, in order to know if this is the place for us.” Grissom tried his best to stay prim, but he made wide eyes at Lionel. Seeing badass cowboy bounty hunter Grissom Graves this flummoxed and uncomfortable would be funny if not for their mission.

“Nonsense. The Duke can do that while you entertain me!” Grissom was dragged off by the arm, and as he looked over his shoulder at Lionel, his expression was one of pure terror. Lionel understood, the Lead Duke was a poet with his guns, but when it came to conversation he was about as effective as a mime with severe social anxiety.

Now the plan needed quick alteration, and as the self proclaimed brains of the pair, Lionel should be able to figure things out. They had heard of the Lord Admiral’s orbiting paradise a few months ago, and more importantly its 100 Zetagel drive that could power an entire city, or an omni generational artificial intelligence stored in the watch at his wrist. It had been a hard few months without Ellie, and he missed her more every day. She was the only one who really understood him, and he even counted Grissom in that summation, who sometimes called him ‘Lester’. He hoped that was just Grissom’s odd sense of humour.

The job was simple, one of them would disable the security systems, and one would steal the quantum drive. Easy peasy, power source squeezy. But now unless this floating palace had a cloning facility or a way to give Lionel four extra arms and a broom up his arse to sweep the floor while he was at it, he wasn’t going to be able to do this quickly.

As Lionel thought wistfully to himself, a small cleaning droid careened into his leg. It was a small purple disc with what looked like small googly eyes., like a cute Roomba, not one that smeared cat shit all over your house or fell off ledges.

“Beep-Bee-Bi-Bo” It squawked.

Lionel was enraptured, his own little R2D2. Finally, space travel could be somewhat how he had fantasised, because let me tell you, there were no cool sex planets, no three-boobed women, and every new life and new civilization they encountered either wanted to kill them, lay eggs in them, or eat them, OR kill them, then lay eggs in them, and then have the hatchlings eat them.

“What’s your name little fella?”

The droid turned around to reveal it’s model number - FR-3D-E. It was perfect, like something he had dreamed. As the droid turned back, a little grey box atop him flapped loosely. “Freddie?” Your name can be Freddie!”

“Bee-Bee-BOO!” The droid squawked, then deposited dust in the shape of a small arrow as he moved away lopsidedly thanks to the loose grey unit. Lionel followed the arrow and droid, the most excited he’d ever been, and one Christmas he got a super-nintendo.

*********

Zaxxon Pisney spread his arms wide as he pointed to a black marble statue of a naked man. “And this is the statue of my ancestor, the great warrior Broad Pecsly, who once beat off seven other men and lay atop them all in the ring, even though they were oiled and writhing. It was the most intoxicating thing I had ever seen.”

“Hmmm.” Grunted Grissom, unsure how to get out of this and back to their mission.

“And this is the storm generator.” Pisney pointed to the shiny machine under the central viewing window. “The laser canon is good for long distance threats, but this machine produces an electromagnetic storm that is more appropriate for dealing with…’close encounters’.” Pisney grabbed a handful of Grissom’s well tailored butt.

“That certainly sounds…efficient.” Grissom muttered.

Zaxxon clutched his hands to his chest. “Finally, someone who gets me. Rocky! You must join us here in orbit, please say you will!?

“I’m afraid I…” Grissom trailed off, something having caught his eye. He moved away and onto the next case, where weapons from all over the galaxy were contained. It was a cabinet of death more glorious than anything he had ever seen - and he had imagined the Super Nintendo Lionel had got for Christmas as Lionel told the story for the 100th time! There was a spiked flail from Middle-Ages Earth, the famous Swaggerhorn of Naxus Prime, a pair of bolt-on double D chest cannons from Siliconia, a deactivated Killmech from the Rim Wars, a pair of…Grissom gasped. There in front of him hung two pairs of laser pistols, each emblazoned with the Crest of House Sindros - a rattlesnake that became a long coil of gatling gun bullets. It was the crest of his old friends, the mute twins Ondar and Fincher. He had last seen them over twenty years ago.

“They are beautiful aren’t they? Duke’s guns are hard to get ahold of, but two pairs that match? It’s next to impossible, unless you know…the right people…isn’t that right Mr Graves?”

Grissom pulled his guns, but Pisney was already on him and put him in a hammerlock before suplexing him into the next glass case that came crashing down all around him.

As glass shards fell around him, Grissom wiped his mouth and drew his bloody hand back. “You might be good in the ring, but this is real life Pisney. You can’t stand toe to toe with a Duke of Lead.”

“Oh, I know that darling, that’s why I brought two of my own.”

Grissom looked up at the case he had flown into, which stored the inert bodies of Ondar and Fincher, two of his best friends from his youth. Parts of them had been replaced by machinery, much like the Technomancer’s flunkey’s, the Harvesters. They wore thick control collars around their necks. And now it became obvious just who was helping the Technomancer keep his corpses reanimated and compliant. Zaxxon brought a controller from his pocket and flicked a switch.

Ondar and Fincher’s eye shone red, and Grissom hoped Lionel was ok, and not about to be killed by robots too.

***********

Lionel whistled as he followed the robot Freddie through the service corridors. A number of other small service droids had amassed to follow them too, and Lionel was in heaven.

“Freddie, where are we going?” He asked.

“Bee Bee Be Bip” Freddie squeaked, that little box swaying loosely back and forth and making him roll lopsidedly.

As Lionel looked back down the corridor, the droids had doubled in number again, but when he turned to follow Freddie, the droids following all brought stabbing tools from their frames and started sharpening them.

Lionel emerged into a large Engineering hub, where because he was too enraptured by the little ‘friends’ he had made, he didn’t realise the bodies of party goers hanging on the wall beside him. It was a processing plant, where the socialites were being transformed into Harvesters and their accounts were being siphoned into Zaxxon Pisney’s private stores.

Freddie pulled a small arm out and patted the floor.

Lionel pulled a corpse over to him and sat on it, still oblivious, pushing a bone down so it didn’t jab him in the butt. “Not exactly comfy in here is it?” He laughed.

Behind him, the other droids sharpened their blades and approached, silently, deadly.

Lionel sighed. “Look Freddie, I shouldn’t be saying this, but I can’t lie to a friend. Me and my friend are spies.” He pulled the powdered wig off. “And we’re here to disable the colony controls and steal the zetadrive. Wait, let me take that box off you, it’s making you all wonky.”

Lionel reached forward and took the control box off Freddie. The Droid spun in an exciting circle.

“BEE-BOOP!” Freddie loudly declared, ordering the others to stop their attacks. If this human could help them escape?

“Freddie?”

Freddie cleared his throat. “Listen kid, my friends and I can help you, but we gotta move fast.”

**************

Grissom dodged as the man once known as Ondar slashed at him with a laser Katana embodied by an ancient lord. As he did, Fincher swept at his legs with the back of an axe, driving Grissom to the ground. Graves rolled away just as Fincher brought the other side of the axe down to the floor.

“Three Dukes of Lead?!” Zaxxon Pisney squealed. “The Technomancer wanted an army, and all this while I’ve been building one of my own. This addition might just be enough. The last active Duke of Lead.”

Grissom rolled to the case and pulled the Swaggerhorn from the wreckage. He had heard stories of the power of this weapon, how it had stopped the encroaching hoards of barbarians of Tellos II with one swing. He stood, braced himself, and blew into it. Biggie’s ‘Hypnotise’ started playing.

Zaxxon Pisney started bobbing his head as the baseline started. “You idiot, the twins are half dead, they have no swagger, no soul!”

Grissom threw the horn at the approaching Ondar, then rushed at Fincher, grabbing them by the collar. “I know you’re both in there, I know you’re stronger than this, fight it!”

“Kiiiiillll ussss, Griiiisssssom.” Fincher whispered, then pulled him by the wrists and threw him back across the room, where Ondar caught him and choked him.

Fincher walked to the cabinet and retrieved the pairs guns, then marched towards Grissom.

“Not the face darlings, it’d be a shame to damage something so pretty.” Zaxxon purred.

***********

“So why put on the robot voice?” Lionel asked as he followed Freddie into the main engineering hub, where the Zeta drive was stored.

Freddie rolled on. “I’m not putting it on, that’s Standard Binary, our language. I’m talking English to you now. Robojesus, broaden your horizons a bit, human. Fucking racist.”

Lionel was abashed, ashamed of his assumption. “I’m really sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you, I was just...”

Freddie laughed. “Nah, I’m just fucking with you dude! You’ve been the first carbon-baser to treat us like we’re alive in over a decade. We’re good. This guy Zaxxon had us killing and zombifying his guests with those damn control collars. But now you’ve freed a few of us, if my kin can turn off the defences, you can take this…”

They came to a deserted main engineering, where a small blue and white box floated in a containment field. The zeta drive was tiny to be holding that much power. “This it?”

“Yep,” said Freddie. “And if the lads are ready, I can give them the nod.” A small antennae raised up out of his frame. “Beeb Boop!”

The containment field dropped, and Lionel reached in and tore the box from the stream. “Well, that was easy.” Lionel said smugly.

The station went dark.

“Critical power losses, destruction imminent.” A computer voice announced.

“Oh, fucking shitting fuck.” Said Lionel

*********

Fincher took her finger off the trigger and spun the pistols back to holsters that weren’t there any more, acting on impulse. She dropped them and threw her arms around her brother, a hug as herself for the first time in who knows how long.

Ondar returned the embrace and offered a hand up to Grissom.

“Good to see you again.” Grissom knelt and picked the pistols up. “These need to be back in the hands of those that earned them.”

The twins took the pistols, Fincher sobbing at the sight of her own hand as she did. The three of them embraced, taking a moment to remember the fallen.

“No, no, no. Stupid robots. Kill, kill, you moronic automatons!” Pisney screamed.

Fincher and Ondar turned as one and unloaded the clips into their jailer, until there was nothing left but two sculpted but now bloody and stumpy legs.

“Whatever you did Lionel, thank you.” Grissom muttered.

*************

As Lionel ‘Middle name undecided, but probably should be legend” Richie ran from Engineering and down the marble pillared concourse to the hanger bay, he felt smugger than a boy who’d got a super nintendo and a mega drive (or genesis for the american audiences) for christmas.

This job had been a clusterfuck, and he hoped that Grissom was waiting for him, and that he’d be able to find him amongst the scores of guests evacuating to escape pods. It wasn’t a surprise it’d all gone wrong - it was dirty out hereon the rim, dirty and messy and it’s leave you tired and raw - if Lionel were more sexually active he would have picked up on the entendre there.

“Hey kid.” Grissom said from alongside him, he watched as the Conveyance of Grissom Graves flew off into the distance.

“Our ship? You let someone take our ship?” Lionel was flabbergasted. I hope you got my stuff out of there, I had half a bag of m&ms in my room.”

“Someone needed it more than us, Lionel. Someone I owed a favour to.” Grissoms eyes were red, and Lionel put a hand to his friend’s shoulder. Grissom put his own hand over it. “Plus we’re in no rush, are we?”

“Well…” Lionel said.

“Station power cores critical. Self destruct in approximately ten minutes.” The colony’s warning systems declared as alarms sounded..

“Don’t worry, sometimes people are naturally good people and they step in horse shit.” Grissom muttered.

Lionel nodded, then stared at his friend. “Wait, were you talking about yourself meeting me?”

“Let’s go find a ship.” Grissom said, one eye still on the ship speeding away from the station.

******

Grissom had played a hunch that Zaxxon would have a short distance vessel somewhere aboard in case he had to bug out quickly, and he was right. The Lord Admiral’s yacht was nestled in the far end of the docking port, away from prying eyes.

Lionel and Grissom prepped the ship for takeoff, and made for the nearest planet, flying between the departing escape pods. Both of them were relatively quiet until Grissom realised what the kid had done on his own. “You did fantastic, kid. It’s hard work crippling a space station and smuggling out a zeta drive on your own.”

“Well, it’s not like he did it alone.” a voice came from Lionel’s backpack, and a small droid popped it’s face out of the bag.

“This is Freddie. He was the leader of the service droids who’d been imprisoned on the colony. Once he helped me get the core, he found out we were taking down the Technomancer and wanted to help.” Lionel said, prepping his eyes to go big and pleading, anticipating a refusal.

“Welcome to the team, I guess.” Lionel nodded, before raising an eyebrow. “Wait, weren’t your people still on board that place?”

“Oh shit, that reminds me.” Freddie pulled his antennae out. “Boop Boo Bip.”

On the station, the self-destruct was cancelled, and Grissom watched as the escape pods started making their way back on board. “What about those? Aren’t those rich profiteers and dicks going to take over again?”

Suddenly, the space around the ship was filled with light as the colony’s Electromagnetic Storm Generator fried every escape pod around.

“Nah, we had a plan for that too. No Filthy organics are going to tell us what to do again.” Freddie gave a sinister chuckle. “Now what do we do?”

Lionel and Grissom shared a look and Lionel grimaced through clenched teeth. “Head down to the planet maybe…if that’s ok?”

Alarms sounded in the cockpit.

“Got no choice, Harvester ships inbound.” Grissom grabbed the controls and sent the ship into a freefall.

*********

They ran, and as Grissom fired back at the insectoid Harvesters, chasing them Lionel held the bag with Freddie and the power source.

They broke into a clearing, and almost instantly Lionel tripped over into the boggy mud beyond. “Get up you miserable sack of….” Lionel had his pistol in hand, and pointed it at the source of Lionel’s fall - A woman dressed in a fox battle suit carrying a laser katana. “ Well, well Lionel, looks like someone else is after that power core.”

The woman had her hand on the hilt, and Grissom’s finger went to the triggers. Next to her and Lionel who was covered in mud, was a small squidman

Two Harvesters split the tension by bursting through the undergrowth into the clearing. The woman was up instantly, igniting the sword and chopping the head off the Harvester.  Grissom unloaded into the other until it stopped twitching. He offered a hand to the woman, as Lionel helped the suited squid up.

“Grissom Graves. This here’s Lionel.” Grissom said.

“Tamia Santo, this is Ludwig Squidlord,” She pointed to the little man that Lionel seemed fascinated by. “And this is my master, the Photonic Clan Chief, Hijoki.” She held up a gross sock on her hand, and made it bow. Greta, she was a crazy person.

“Lionel I swear if you poisoned me again with those ‘burritees’ again…”

“It’s burritos, and I didn’t poison you, I told you you needed to peel the tinfoil off!” Lionel protested.

Above them in the atmosphere, coming from nowhere as if it crashed into existence with a popping of air, a long spaceship appeared. It looked like nothing any of them had ever seen.

“Well that’s about right for today.” Grissom said as he took another shot at the beetleman’s corpse for good measure”

“It looks like something from Lord of the Rings.” Lionel said, no one around knowing what the hell he was talking about.

“Well, I say we go find out what’s up there. And if it’s a Technomancer, woe betide it.” The sock said.

“Fuck yeah.” Grissom said, reloading the pistols and throwing Lionel his half a bag of M&Ms.

THE END
