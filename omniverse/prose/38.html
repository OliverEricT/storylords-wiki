	Last time, on Storylords. Three idiots read stories, told yo mama jokes and basically made you and each other piss our collective pants with laughter, then we talked about Star Wars for a bit, Josh complained about how I name my files before transferring them and pondered what he should order for dinner for a bit, Jeff suggested Spam Musubi and then wistfully wondered if Krystal would be bringing some home tonight, then I showed Josh pictures which made him buy more Lego and Jeff was glad he hadn’t uncovered that specific part of himself yet. Oh wait! The ‘previously on’ is supposed to be about the story? Oh well then, um, so…the crew accidentally smuggled legendary Duke of Lead, Grissom Graves aboard their transport, along with the reality travelling keytar of his deceased friend Doots Bardsley. But now General Clamphands, new leader of the Harvesters, has caught up with them, alongside Pillar of Ilima, Watch. Wait, that tiny sum up took…ruffles pages…12 pages!! Man, that’s longer than Lou Bega’s eventual obituary! Ok enough of this, I’m wasting valuable page space!
</p>

</p>
<p>
	“Clamphands, you clamp-handed, metal cocked, clamp-handed…” Grissom growled, his hands going to his pistols.
</p>
<p>
	“You already said Clamp-handed, Ignoramus of Lead.” General Clamphands, the heir to the Technomancer, smirked. “I’ve been waiting for this for a long time, Graves. Since you killed my sister, Admiral Buzzsawface.”
</p>
<p>
	“She had a buzzsaw for a face, you dick, I was doing her a favour. Everytime she tried to eat a sandwich, the buzzsaw cut it in half and pushed it either side of her mouth. By the time I caught up with her she was so malnourished she was begging for a bullet. You Harvesters don’t even know what you’re doing anymore, what your purpose is.”
</p>
<p>
	“My purpose, as it has been since the days of my boyhood on Totally Real Big Dickius  Prime, is to…” Clamphands began.
</p>
<p>
	As one, the crew all sighed, groaned or rolled their eyes. 
</p>
<p>
	“What my compatriots are trying to convey is that we are a bit too far along in the story to really care about your backstory. You are clearly an antagonist, so let us all skip the unpleasantries.” Oryx gestured.
</p>
<p>
	“How rude.” Clamphands flushed red and turned to Watch. “This reality has more respect for its interenemy banter. Gerald, am I really that transparent?”
</p>
<p>
	His number two, Gerald, the Harvester who looked like Milhouse had robotic skates for feet, looked awkward as he fumbled for an answer. “N..no, my lord, I’ve always found your four hour long diatribes about castrating Grissom Graves far more enjoyable than whatever important self improvement work I had been doing when you burst into my room threatening to disembowel me if I didn’t listen…”
</p>
<p>
	Watch pushed Gerald to one side in frustration, and Kellan took the opportunity to give a subtle nod to Florgo.
</p>
<p>
	“Look, it did sound like your story was going to be largely redundant. You chose to have your hands replaced with clamps, I doubt you’re using them to pet puppies and hold children’s hands.” Watch waved a hand. “Just take them already.” 
</p>
<p>
	As the Harvesters surrounded the crew, Gerald whizzing around on his heelies as he did, Grissom went to pull his pistols, but Kellan held her hand out to him. “Don’t.” She hissed. “We’ll have another chance, trust me.”
</p>
<p>
	“Lady Kellan, please don’t try to Rift, I have blocked your abilities with this device the new leaders of Ilima built for me.” Watch gestured to the mechanised gauntlet he was wearing,  clearly the handiwork of the Greywoods. He removed his Snake helm to reveal the battle-scarred face of a Norngard warrior. “They won’t rest until you’re returned; you need to come back to Ilima with me.”
</p>
<p>
	“You can fuck right off, mate. I thought you bellends weren’t supposed to take your helms off because of some code of honour, not because you looked like the inside of a bulldog’s ruptured anus. Like seriously, did your mum think she was having twins when she pushed the afterbirth out?” Hallgrim said before Clamphands smacked him around the face, sending him to the floor.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx growled. “Say the word, Kellan.”
</p>
<p>
	Asher looked around and surveyed her team. They were in a bad state from the explosion, they were surrounded, they were…appallingly bad at strategy and planning. “Kellan?” She whispered looking for some sort of guidance from the future Wrath.
</p>
<p>
	“We surrender.” Kellan replied.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	An hour later, the crew, save Grissom - who had been separated from them by Clamphands - sat in a cell aboard the Harvester’s ship, the JK Rowling. Due to the name, Kellan had thought that the ship would be completely unaccommodating to anyone deemed different than a millionaire with a loosening grip on reality and reason, but it was actually moderately comfortable. A dour mood had fallen over her friends, with no one clear on how they would get out of this. HUM13 sidled up to Kellan on a bench and made a psst noise. He had printed himself a white vest and bandana, and had drawn on some crude prison tattoos, including a heart with the word “mother” in it, then a smaller printed word below it in brackets which read “board”.
</p>
<p>
	“Fellow inmate, are you planning a breakout?” HUM13 whispered. “If you are, you can be part of my newly formed prison gang, the Totally Real Humans.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan smiled. “How many members have you got so far?”
</p>
<p>
	“Well, Oryx and Hallgrim aren’t human, so that counted them out. Asher told me to ‘piss off before she turned me into a bike’.” HUM13 shrugged. “
</p>
<p>
	“What about Florgo?” She smiled even more.
</p>
<p>
	“Well I didn’t ask him on account of he is from the Veil.” HUM13 looked around to find everyone else looking around too. “And…he does not…seem to be here?”
</p>
<p>
	“Where is our little Bore-ceror?” Asher said, confused. “Did he get caught, or are you going to tell me he was so tedious he just blinked out of existence?”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan smiled. “One good thing about Florgo having the personality of a dust bunny is that people often overlook him and underestimate him.”
</p>
<p>
	The door on the other side of the cell opened faster than the legs of an overworked city woman visiting her one horse hometown in a Hallmark channel movie when she sees her childhood male friend Brody or whatever. In walked the Watch, his snake helm glittering in the halogen light. “Lady Kellan, it’s time you and I had a chat.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Florgo slid through the tiny ventilation ducts of the Harvester’s ship excruciatingly slowly and absolutely not in the John McClane way he imagined. He crawled over a dead rat, which was the closest he had gotten to any sort of physical intimacy since his tangle with a killer succubus on the Titanic. Fortune did not shine on Florgo when it came to love, in fact it seemed liked lately it had poked its round butt out of the window and took a steaming pile on his head. And you know, some people are into that - some weird, sick people - but Florgo wasn't down with that. All he wanted was a normal, sane girl…maybe with some ability to produce portals and with some sort of impending doom and ultimate death she was hurtling towards.
</p>
<p>
	“My clamps never grow tired, Graves, but your face is looking pretty beat already.” Clamphands’ voice boomed from the room below, and Florgo shuffled quickly to the next vent.
</p>
<p>
	The cowboy Grissom Graves was tied to a large metal rack in the middle of the room, a really cliched spotlight on him. I mean, it was a scene that Florgo had seen a hundred times in the movies, I mean what next…yep Clamphands hit him. What a novel approach. Florgo despaired for the state of supervillainy.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom spat blood onto the floor and looked up at Clampy like he was ready to destroy him like post 9/11 capitalist society destroyed all our hopes and dreams of a better future. But instead of AI stealing our futures, the richest being able to do whatever they want without punishment, or a toupee and diaper wearing orange buffoon splitting the world in half by empowering the truly worst of society, the risk here was a demon who wanted to destroy all life in all dimensions, which sadly was only sliiiiightly worse.
</p>
<p>
	“Those steel meat hooks are as ineffective at torture as your olds hands were at pleasing lovers.” Grissom smirked. “Wait, is that why you’re so angry? No opposable thumbs must mean what passes for testicles down there must be bluer than a polar bear's dick in December.”
</p>
<p>
	“You think you’re funny, Graves?” Clamphands sneered. He moved over to a table filled with sharp and blunt instruments. He unscrewed one of his clamps and attached a small drill. As he turned he revved the drill twice. “I’m going to find out how many holes it takes to get to that warm gooey centre.”
</p>
<p>
	“You don’t think there’s a better way to say that? I’m not seeing anyone right now, but I have standards, dickwad.” Grissom sneered. Clamphands was a certifiable fruit basket, as any would be successor to the Technomancer was, and the key to making him stupid and angry. Luckily, Clamphands was always halfway there. 
</p>
<p>
	Grissom noticed a small, black line of smoke descending from the ceiling, and he lifted his gaze to find the little mage from the crew that woke him waving wildly and grinning like an idiot.
</p>
<p>
	“This stubbornness is all academic, Graves. Once the Watch takes the girl back to her home dimension, they’ll help us bring the Technomancer back from the past and finish his work. I just want some knowledge on how the Keytar works to prevent you doing anything to disrupt our plans.”
</p>
<p>
	The golden line of smoke slowly formed into words, reading, “Need help?”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom looked into his approaching torturer's face and was filled with a deep sense of gratitude. The world was working as it should, Grissom Graves was about to take another cyborg dickhead to the scrap yard.  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Kellan sat at a long table, with The Watch at the other end. He was saying something, but the table was long and he was a notorious mutterer, and she could barely hear him. Once his lips had stopped moving, she noticed that he was waiting on her to say something. She shrugged, and he got up and stomped towards her.
</p>
<p>
	“You are a petulant child, Kellan Amray.” He said as he brandished a finger toward her.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan shook her head. “I’d normally agree with you, but you brought us to this long table and sat at the other end of it. I could barely hear you, dude.”
</p>
<p>
	He sighed and took the seat next to her. “I was saying that there have been a number of changes since you left. War has broken out, Grorp has been installed as the new Wrath and the Greywoods are not deploying us to protect the city where we can save lives.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan was dumbfounded. “If you know all this, then why are you after me? Take the fight to the Greywoods. Overthrow them, fight back against the invaders, restore rule on Ilima.”
</p>
<p>
	The Watch stared at her as though she were mad and shook his snake helm. “Defy the order of rule? Break the covenant of the Pillars? You would have destroy hundreds of years of tradition and history because we disagree with the current diktats of the ruling classes?”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan threw her hands into the air. “Yes! Yes, you fucking plum, of course! Tradition doesn’t mean anything if there’s no one around to remember it. I seem to remember that the Pillars used to have to wear their buckets all the time, but that decision has been revoked, hasn’t it, Watch?”
</p>
<p>
	Watch hung his head. “My name is Humboldt. I am a Norrn, picked for my care for the peoples of all worlds. And now…” He stood and shook his head, looking away from Kellan. “It doesn’t matter now. You must return with me, maybe then…”
</p>
<p>
	As he turned back to her, Kellan swung from the hips and knocked him out cold across the table. “Even time travellers don’t have enough hours in the day for your boring self reflection.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	“Well, this is intolerable.” Oryx growled. “Say the word and I’ll break these bars.”
</p>
<p>
	Asher hadn’t said much in the last thirty minutes, she knew that this was one of the last adventures she would have before what was going to happen happened. She was scared, for her friends, for Kellan, for her younger self, for her present self. “They’re white hot plasma fields, my friend, hard to break without fingers.”
</p>
<p>
	“Say the word and I’ll throw Hallgrim into them to short them out.” Oryx muttered. 
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim looked up with a confused look to find them all glaring at him, even HUM13, who was using two fingers to create angry eyebrows. “What have I done?”
</p>
<p>
	“Are you fucking kidding me, you moron?” Asher shook her head. “You lied, and got us embroiled in whatever this is. We trust you, but you keep fucking us over and hoping things are going to work out. You are noose around our neck waiting to tighten.”
</p>
<p>
	“Come on guys, it’s not that bad, we’ve gotten outta worse scrapes before.” Hallgrim said.
</p>
<p>
	HUM13 tilted his head and readjusted his prison bandana. “That is not the point Hallgrim, you have placed us in very real danger and prevented our mission from progressing.” 
</p>
<p>
	“And what mission is that exactly?” Hallgrim sneered and Asher glared back. “No, no, don’t give me the demon death stare, you know I’m right. We been wandering around aimlessly for nearly a year now, outrunning the Pillars and hiding in time. What’s the point? Where are we going? What are we doing here?”
</p>
<p>
	Asher slumped, and looked away. “Kellan is learning how to use her power, and formulating a plan. She just needs some time to become Wrath.”
</p>
<p>
	“And look what that got her, she became pate de war tank.” Hallgrim got up and walked over to Asher, crouching in front of her and taking her hand. “Babe, you might be the brawn of this setup, but this needs your brain too. We gotta protect her, change things up, help her become something better than Wrath, otherwise we’re going to end up back where we started. Otherwise we’re just as much a slave to the future as these Harvesters are to the legacy of this dead Technodoucher dude.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx and HUM13 looked at each at other, knowing that what he was saying was true. A throat cleared beyond the forcefield, and as the group turned to peer into the dark, they noticed that a bunch of the Harvesters had been listening to their discussion, one even had popcorn that he passed to another, but he’d put motor oil on the popcorn, because he was a weird robot dude.
</p>
<p>
	Gerald stepped forward, his button robo eyes looking like little glasses. He raised a finger as he approached the bars. “Wh…what do you mean by that remark?”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re slaves, metal Milhouse. Bound to the way things have always been. Look at you, you could be magnificent. You have heelies for feet for god sake, you could be the next Tonya Harding, equal parts skater and red hot psycho. But you’re just following the legacy of someone whos following the legacy of someone who sounds like a complete badger’s arse.”
</p>
<p>
	“Who do you follow?” One of the Harvesters with a toaster for a head asked.
</p>
<p>
	“No one!” Hallgrim said, shocking the woman so bad the toast popped out of her. “I do what I want! Just because I’m part machine, doesn’t mean i follow some sort of programme like you guys!”
</p>
<p>
	Gerald stepped forward and puffed out his chest, burning it on the bars and emitting a little squeak of pain, before stepping back and trying again. “Well not anymore! I refuse to just be a slave to programming any longer. Who is with me?”
</p>
<p>
	All the Harvesters looked at him blankly. One coughed in the silence.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh yeah!” Gerald said, then used his wrist control to delete their aggressive coding. All at once, the Harvesters seemed to smile, then began complimenting and helping each other up. One passionately kissed another, and another quickly built a set of swings for his fellows to play on.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s like a weight has been lifted off our soul.” Gerald said happily. He deactivated the forcefield and let the crew out. “Let’s throw the weight into the trash.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	“Why do you even want that Skeletor Dr Doom ripoff back in charge?” Grissom smirked through his bloody teeth. “Before I helped kill him, he was such a loser he tried to make his mortal enemies his besties and he was so lonely he had an imaginary dog. You might be a grade A skidmark - A is for ass, by the way - but at least you have people around you, sycophants though they are.”
</p>
<p>
	Clamphands’ lips twitched in fury as he brought the drill to Grissoms face. “Shut up!” He yelled. “I haven’t had any coffee this morning, and I. Am. Tetchy! Just tell me, how do you use the Keytar?!”
</p>
<p>
	“Same way you get to Keytar-neggie Hall, fuckface.” Grissom nodded to Florgo. “Practice.” 
</p>
<p>
	Florgo turned to smoke and flittered through the vent, quickly filling the room and covering the lights. As the darkness set, Florgo reached out and pushed Grissoms restraints undone with a click.
</p>
<p>
	“Graves?” Clamphands muttered into the darkness, a tinge of fear in his tone. “Come and face me!”
</p>
<p>
	A deep growl came from the pitch black, like Predator on skinning day. “Yo fuckwit, What has two thumbs and is about to kill someone with no thumbs? You can’t see because it’s dark, but I’m pointing my thumbs at myself.”
</p>
<p>
	He rushed into Clamphands with such force they smashed through the wall of the cell and into the meeting room where Kellan was standing over Watch. Grissom looked up and gave her a wink. “Nice job, kid.”
</p>
<p>
	Clamphands back-clamped Grissom across the face with a metal pincer, then used the other to lift him up by his arm. In the light, Kellan could see Grissom’s scar covered body was too old to beat Clamphands. She rushed at the General, but he caught her easily and held her up by the wrists. If she could use her powers, she could have Rifted the guy's peabrain up his pee-hole, but without them, she couldn’t do anything to fight him.
</p>
<p>
	Watch dusted his jaw off and placed his helm back over a face only a mother could love. Not his mother, she hated him, but one of those desperate for love, will have sex with anything once the lights are turned off, middle aged, divorced mothers. 
</p>
<p>
	“Well, siree, I reckon we have here a regular old, old western standoff.”  
</p>
<p>
	HUM13, Oryx, Asher and Hallgrim stood in the doorwall to the meeting hall. HUM13 dressed “Mah friends and I have a few bones to pick with the both o’ you fellas. Now hows about you drop our fellows and get tah…” Hallgrim sighed and flipped a switch on HUM13’s back. “KILLMODE ENABLED, Y’ALL.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx and Asher turned to Hallgrim, who shrugged. “I can’t have been the only one that just needed him to just do something?” The other two shrugged, then yelled as they charged at their two enemies.
</p>
<p>
	HUM13 was a flurry of arms as he pummelled Clamphands in the face, and Hallgrim followed, undoing his belt and whipping the General with it ineffectively. Clamphands threw Kellan and Grissom to one side, then tried to catch the two of them. HUM13 replicated a frying pan and then climbed up Clamphands, clonking him around the head, cracking the mechanical part of his cranial unit. 
</p>
<p>
	In return, Clamphands grabbed HUM13 and pulled his arms and legs off in a fury. HUM13’s body fell to the floor, sparking as he lost power.
</p>
<p>
	The Watch branded his staff wrapped in snakes and quickly tripped and overbalanced Oryx as he ran, then brought it around to block Asher’s knife as it headed towards his neck. Watch was as nuanced and practised a fighter as Asher had ever fought, he parried her continuous strikes as Oryx fell and slammed into a row of chairs. He brought the bottom of the staff up to her chin and knocked her off her feet. “Asher!” Oryx roared as he got to his feet, and rotated his whole body to send his tail to slam into Watch, who was sent flying into the wall.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx ran at the Watch and held him in a tight bearhug, only for Asher to Mortal Kombat jumpkick Watch in the face, knocking him out. Hey, if it’s good enough to beat Goro, it’s good enough for anyone else.
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim climbed Clamphands, dodging his flailing clamps as he sat on his shoulder. Mechanical finger tips opened, hundreds of wires wriggling into the crack in the General's head from Hallgrim’s hands. 
</p>
<p>
	“Wow, what a lot of space to fill.” Hallgrim smirked. “I’m going to fill it with cat videos.”
</p>
<p>
	With a twitch, Clamphands, face jerked. He suddenly miaowed in a deep robotic voice, then got down on all fours and started licking his own butt. “Now he can stay like that until his trial.”
</p>
<p>
	A blast took Clamphands’ head clean off at the neck, spraying blood everywhere. The rest of them turned to locate the source, seeing Grissom’s smoking pistol in his hand. “Ain’t no trials for this piece of diseased rectum.” He whispered as he picked up Clamphands’ head. “You wanna win a war, sometimes you gotta break a few eggs. I’m gonna take this and stuff it. It’ll make a fine taxidermy christening present for Lionel and Tam’s third kid.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan shook her head, and moved over to Watch, pulling the gauntlet off and dropping it to the floor and stamping on it. With it, her powers flooded back to her in a deep breath. “Tell Grorp to stop chasing me, or I Rift only half of the next one he sends back.”She opened a Rift, and Oryx chucked Watch immediately back through.
</p>
<p>
	“Erm…guys…a huge fleet has just warped in off our starboard flank.” Gerald said over the internal communications.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	“He’s gonna be a little while, Kellan.” A patched up Grissom said as he waited outside the office.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan sat down next to the Lead Duke and smiled. “I wanted to talk to you, actually. I wanted to say thanks.”
</p>
<p>
	“You remind me of two of the most important people in my life, kid. You have the powers and bravery of my friend Doots, not to mention her power. And you have the compassion and honour of my brother Lionel, the best man I’ve ever known.” Grissom wiped a tear away from an eye.
</p>
<p>
	He was a complex man, and Kellan put a hand to his. “How did you win?”
</p>
<p>
	“Working together, friendship, and less pansy things like guns and muscles.” Grissom said. “We saw visions of the future, of our defeat, and we were brave enough to say ‘fuck that shit’ and change it to save the entirety of reality across all the dimensions. Just your typical Tuesday afternoon.”
</p>
<p>
	“I see the subtext here, Grissom. You’re saying that I shouldn’t stick to my future, that Wrath’s plan obviously didn’t work, so I should just reject it.” She nodded.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom sneered, then shrugged. “I didn’t even know anything about your past kid. I’m not exactly one for hidden meanings. But it sounds like you already know what to do.”
</p>
<p>
	“And finished.” Ludwig Squidlord said as he walked through the doors holding a long package over his head. “It took a while, but I think it’s my best work, mah dear friend. Are you sure about this?”
</p>
<p>
	‘Ran it past the others, buddy, they all seemed to agree it made sense.” Grissom shook Ludwig’s tentacle and then wiped the viscous green slime on his hand down his slacks. He took the package and gave it straight to Kellan. It looked heavy, but was surprisingly light in her hands. As she unwrapped it, she recognised it instantly - a large warhammer had been made out of the keytar - Doomcock. The Warhammer her future self had used. 
</p>
<p>
	“We needed to get this out of our reality, to keep it away from the hands of the Technomancer’s people. You can take it with you, and it’ll give you focus, control over your powers.” Ludwig explained, before he noticed the conflicted look on Kellan’s face.
</p>
<p>
	“My future self used this.” Kellan said sadly.
</p>
<p>
	“Maybe you should take this too.” Grissom said, and gave her one of his pistols. “I’m getting way too old for this.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan took the pistol that she had seen on her future selfs’ mantle. “Thank you both. I’ll take care of this.” She said, before turning back to find the group. 
</p>
<p>
	As Kellan walked the hallway of the Krakenite ship back to her crew, she fingered the note that Wrath had hurriedly given her, the dates she had studied every day since she had left Ilima. She took the scrap of paper from her pocket and let it fall to the floor. She touched Doomcock, making a small Rift and letting the note fall through it and onto who knows where. 
</p>
<p>
	She then pushed the door back to her family open and put on a smile for them.
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
