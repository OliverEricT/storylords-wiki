	Caption: Ilima, 284 years ago, 16 years after the galactic war and the founding of Breakthrone. We start on an establishing shot of Ilima, which because I didn’t previously describe the skyline or anything because that shit is super boring in a comedy podcast, I won’t bother doing it now. (SIGH) I mean, if you really wanna know, there’s the Financial District, the industrial complex, and the public baths. There’s the sexatorium with some hot sex workers outside. Imagine your deepest kink and I’ll paint a picture…yep they’re doing that right no…FUCKING HELL JEFF, what the hell is that?!  And Josh I’m not kink shaming, but I can’t use that in a story, this is a family show - I mean not a family you want to be a part of, maybe a stepmom trapped in the washing machine type family, but still!! There are some beautiful architectural designs, there’s the crystal city, there’s the other sexatorium - the slightly less upmarket one where Greg’s kinks are catered to…you know where they BLEEP you in the slippery BLEEP BLEEP with a rusty BLEEP swirled round your BLEEP dirty canoe BLEEP between two slices of BLEEP and BLEEP with a ball peen hammer right up the BLEEP with BLEEP BLEEP and BLEEP jalopy BLEEP by a sad presbyterian with a BLEEP stuffed BLEEP.

<p>
	Down in a lab by the docks Dr Anna Tomika finished her final touches on her newest and greatest creation; look, they don’t just have hookers and crime down by the docks, they also have legitimate businesses too, weird right? That invention: an illegal hookerbot. She took off her safety goggles to reveal the thick bottleneck goggles that were only slightly thinner than the goggles she had just removed.
</p>
<p>
	“Science log 390. I have just completed my beloved. He is twice as beautiful as that piece of shit that took my dignity and half of everything we had built together to shack up with that younger graduate student with the rounder methodology and perkier conclusions. But I need him no longer! I can have my cock and eat it! My creation is perfect, not like that first botched attempt to make a lover out of my favoured fruit, the cucumber. Many are those that have tried to master true artificial sentience, be it for good and for ill, but they lacked the real driver for success, the real incentive - blueballs. My beloved will do whatever I command, can open any jar I need him to, will ask me how my day is and listen to the response without trying to propose a solution, and he will always be as lubed up and hard as I want him to be, hence the 12 million space dollarbucks I have spent on penis hydraulics and bevelled ribbing in this 12.5 million space dollarbuck project. Now all I have to do is activate him, and then he can turn me on! Gourdon!” She yelled into the other room. “Get in here, you sickening little green freak!”
</p>
<p>
	A tall, thin, green cylinder of a man came hobbling into the lab, footsteps squelching as he did. “Yes, my mistress? Is it time for you to grind up and down my body with your soft parts again? And might I remind you and all listeners again that I’m a fruit and not a vegetable or gourd.”
</p>
<p>
	Anna rolled her eyes. “No, you need to rest, lest your outer skin get too soft and moist. Now quickly, remove the tarp from our new family member, whilst I work my magic!”
</p>
<p>
	“Are you not worried that this experiment may bring us unwanted attention?” Gourdon said. “The Othodoxy shun robotic research.”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s worth the risk, now do it, you sex toy with a conscience!”
</p>
<p>
	Gourden pulled the coverings off the robot as Anna rushed over to the controls and pulled a frankenstein switch down, you know the ones I mean - the handles that cause a connection and make sparks. Look if I knew all the science jargon, I wouldn’t be working for a charity now, would I? HUM13 sprang to life in all the areas Anna wanted him to. 
</p>
<p>
	“He’s erect! He’s erect!” She yelled as she looked down at the engraved body before her. The name plate read HUM-13.
</p>
<p>
	HUM13 blinked his eyes open. “Mama?” He asked.
</p>
<p>
	Anna shuddered. “Oh god, am I wearing asbestos underwear or have I instantly dried up down there?”
</p>
<p>
	An explosion shook the building, and Anna turned to her lab assistant. “Stay here, Gourdon, keep him safe.” HUM13 looked at her with doe eyes and reaching arms.
</p>
<p>
	“Yes Master.” Gourdon said.
</p>
<p>
	Anna ran into the lobby, where through the dust and debris, men were pouring through the blown open doors of the lab, the men of the Brotherhood of Orthodoxy. At the head of the armed group was her old college rival, Doctor Braghurst. She had a giant smirk plastered across her botox filled balloon animal lips, as those around her aimed their laser rifles at Anna. 
</p>
<p>
	“Illegal AI sexbot experimentation…tut tut tut. As I told you all those years ago, Anna..” Braghurst smiled. “You think more with your loins than your brain.”
</p>
<p>
	“And you think more…I mean you…you…” Anna struggled. ‘You’re a bitch!”
</p>
<p>
	“Are you sure you’re not a doctor of literature with comebacks like that?” Braghurst said. “Surrender your research and your prototype and I’ll think about letting the Brotherhood of Orthodoxy avoid shots to your face.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m shocked you knew that avoiding shots to the face was an option. But oh man, Braghurst, did you uptight religious freaks walk into the wrong fucking lab tonight.” Anna smiled.
</p>
<p>
	A blur of massive shadow (Don’t worry, it’s not that dildo your mother uses) descended from the ceiling instantly landing on three of the brotherhood with a sickening crunch and rolling with them until they lay still on the floor. A large limb flew out and thwacked another’s gun from their grip, taking the man’s arms clean with it.
</p>
<p>
	The remaining two Brotherhood members aimed at the shadow and fired, but the bullet’s bounced off the mass and fell swiftly to the floor like your momma’s underwear after a Ryan Gosling trailer - I mean in this case, who can blame her, he IS a beautiful man. The blur jumped the attackers with precision, making short work as it created a looney tunes-esque smoke cloud and left them with broken limbs and a lack of consciousness.
</p>
<p>
	“May I introduce my friend, Oryx.” Anna smirked.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx stood as furious as he’d ever been. It had been a hard few weeks for the splicer, separated from his friends in a past he knew nothing about. He had come to terms with the fact that they may never find him, and it had made him frigid and distant, like a Republican’s sexlife.
</p>
<p>
	Instead of full on shitting or leaving a Braghurst shaped hole on the door on her way outta dodge, the religious scientist instead stepped to one side to reveal a shadowy figure of her own, a robotic figure that Oryx knew.
</p>
<p>
	“Humie?” He whispered, glad to see his friend, rushing towards him with open arms. “Where the hell have you been? I was looking…”
</p>
<p>
	In return, Hum13 swung a buzzsaw-arm at the crocodilian, which Oryx only just dodged. He looked up at his friend, and noticed the blazing red eyes. 
</p>
<p>
	“Killmode enabled!” Hum-13 said without emotion as he marched towards Oryx.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	THREE WEEKS EARLIER
</p>
<p>
	Wait, what’d you mean ‘Is Rich is doing the old, split the narrative for dramatic effect schtick again?’ Look it works doesn’t it, you wanna know what’s happened to everyone’s favourite crocodile and legitimate human don’t you? What do you want instead, a load of inappropriate jokes about your parentage? Well then stop whining and let’s get back to it! Also your Dad is totally still coming back, he just can’t find the specific cigarette brand he likes. I think they’re called LoserDisappointmentChild Cigarettes.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx fell through the Rift landed with a crash into the alleyway, crushing a pile of cans that three homeless people were using as pins in their bowling game. A woman behind him cheered. “Steeee-rike!”
</p>
<p>
	“That doesn’t count, Aruba!” An older man said, petulantly. “Idiots falling from the sky aren’t exactly kosher for alleyball!”
</p>
<p>
	Another man laughed, as he went to help Oryx up. “Whatcha gunna do, call the league, Sally?”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx stumbled to his feet, feeling as beat up as Ben Shaprio’s pride every time a person of colour is recognised in any positive way. Sadly, that isn’t often, which is why fuckwads like him are so enabled. Oryx stood, using the man’s shoulder as support, straightened to a full six feet taller than his crutch. Aruba gasped. “Ee’s a splicer!”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx looked them up and down, ready for confrontation. It was at least a positive that he was in a reality where he was being recognised for what he actually was. It could’ve been far worse, a reality where Billionaires control all forms of media, or whereby the governments of the world are actively seeking to disenfranchise the people, or where Storylords only had a tenth of its listeners signed up as patrons…OH WAIT that’s THIS reality! Like seriously guys, a time may come when this show has to go monthly or something because we don’t have the necessary support, so please consider pledging. At least that’s what Oryx wants you to do, and he seems PRETTY smart. 
</p>
<p>
	However, to their credit, the vagrants seemed to not be bothered by his appearance, more just initially shocked by his intimidating size. Sally took off his coat and threw it up and over Oryx’s shoulders, and the younger guy, Dominga, poured him something hot from a thermos he quickly stashed back behind a dumpster. 
</p>
<p>
	“Always got time for a fellow mistreated war vet.” Sally smiled.
</p>
<p>
	“You have my gratitude, my friend. I only need to cease the tremors from my shock arrival then you may have your coat returned.” Oryx nodded at Sally. “When did the war end?”
</p>
<p>
	“Poor lad has got PTSD.” Aruba smiled, her Norn skin brushed with a tinge of blue. 
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t worry, buddy, all got a touch of that. Me and Aruba fought at Telfer’s ridge, Sally was a dredge runner in the Siltax Belt.” Dominga shook his head. “War ended nearly 17 years ago now, after it was declared bad for business. You’re safe.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx did the calculations, this would have been a few years after the Pillars destroyed his home and sent him…he looked around suddenly. “My friends! I was travelling with five others, they should have arrived concurrently. One is a Norn cyborg who might have tried having sex with one or all of you, one a magician (you may not have noticed him, he has a tendency to blend in), one is a human inside the body of a robot…”
</p>
<p>
	“We seen the Robot a few days back!” Aruba nodded. “Thought it was some sort of war weapon at first, and hid. He was plenty disorientated, kept singing showtunes and doing improv bits. Asked about the nearest costume store as soon as he saw us. Didn’t take long before someone took him.”
</p>
<p>
	“How long? Who?”
</p>
<p>
	A spotlight shone on them from above. Oryx looked up, he saw a large military vehicle hovering above them as the force of vtol engines blew trash around the alley.
</p>
<p>
	“My vintage Porno mag collection!” Yelled Dominga.
</p>
<p>
	“My vintage can collection!” Yelled Aruba.
</p>
<p>
	“My vintage nothing because homeless people don’t really have things and need help in our society!” Yelled Dominga.
</p>
<p>
	Armoured and gun wielding men descended from the ship, pointing their weapons at Oryx the moment feet touched ground. They looked as if they were going to beat him without asking a single question, judging him based on looks and not deed.
</p>
<p>
	“How have the NYPD travelled to the future?” Oryx asked, a keen study of history if ever there was.
</p>
<p>
	“Brotherhood of Othodoxy.’ One muttered. “You gene freaks were outlawed on Ilima after the armistice, you’re going to have to come with us.”
</p>
<p>
	Old Sally stood forward, between Oryx and the guards, shaking a finger at the soldiers. “You ain’t got no authority here, you damn zealots! You go back to whatever pre-war hole you came out of, preferably the one your lord and saviour came back from the dead from. You’re worshipping a zombie, did you know that. Jesus…” He spat on the floor in front of them.
</p>
<p>
	One of the brotherhood stepped forward and hit Sally with the butt of his gun, his nose exploding into a spray of blood. Oryx pounced instantly, and we cut away to the reactions of the three homeless vets as Oryx treated cops how they should be treated. “With respect and honour?” Fuck off narc, get the fuck outta this podcast. No seriously, if you think that, then turn off the podcast and go sit in another room, I don’t even want you sitting in the same place as the electronics you use to listen to us with, in case you catch a stray joke. You’re banned, you hear me? Banned! Did you learn nothing from all that 90s rap you profess to love. Fuck da police Now, before you listen to anymore Lords stories, you go listen to Pigs by Cyprus Hill on repeat for the week. Eating breakfast? PIGS. Taking a dump? PIGS. Getting busy? PIGS. And when you realise that the thin blue line is a long streak of yellow, you can come back and rejoin your fellow human beings.
</p>
<p>
	And when the blood was dripping from Oryx’s jaws and he was only slightly horrified by what he had done because he’d only killed some sub humans, he turned to find his fellow vets had run off and left. He ran to the other end of the alley, where he was met by a hover van with blacked out windows and graffiti of the california raisins, the poddington peas, and another famous vegetable…I dunno, what am I mr answers? The side door opened and a green arm poked out. 
</p>
<p>
	“Come with us if you want to live.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx squinted. “ Are you a cucumber man?”
</p>
<p>
	“I call him my stickle, you know, because he’s a pickle I stick in my…look, get in, otherwise they’ll be back in greater numbers, and what happened to your friend will happen to you too.” A voice called from the driver's seat. 
</p>
<p>
	Oryx complied, and the van sped off.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	HUM13 activated and tried to move, but found his arms tied down to the table. His first thought was articulated well enough. “Hallgrim, if this is your attempt to find out what sex is like with a genuine human, you are barking up the wrong titanium carbinium composite.”
</p>
<p>
	“You. Are. Fascinating!” A thin, reedy voice came from behind him, feminine but like a school headmistress, clipped and precise. “Immoral? Certainly. Ultimately sinful? Of course. But so unlike anything I’ve ever seen.”
</p>
<p>
	“You haven’t seen a human before? You should get out more, lady.”
</p>
<p>
	She walked around to HUM13’s front, and he wasn’t surprised by what he saw. She was thin and tall, with short grey hair. She wore the most ostentatious crucifix around her neck, as if she’d won the Miss Christian Worship awards and wanted everyone to know it. Or she was some Christianity themed stripper, though Humie predicted the former. Then he noticed the precision drill in her hands. She straddled him and held the drill to his head. “Why go out, when there’s so much we can do in here?”
</p>
<p>
	“I really must protest. I must locate my friends.” 
</p>
<p>
	“When I’m finished here, you won’t even remember your friends. You’ll have me. My name is Doctor Muta Braghurst.” She removed the screws from his face plate and took it away to reveal the bucket-esque metal skeletal structure underneath, like a bargain bin Terminator.
</p>
<p>
	Hum13 suddenly remembered. “Oh I forgot. Argh! That hurts! Please don’t!”
</p>
<p>
	“No need to pretend, the real pain will start now.” She reached behind his eyes, and then Humie really did feel what agony was like, and for once he wished he wasn’t human. He screamed as she pulled a small metal box from his brain, then went silent. Braghurst held it in front of her to survey it, then placed it in her pocket. When she looked back to her prisoner, his eyes flashed red.
</p>
<p>
	“Awaiting programming, master.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Oryx walked into Dr Tomika’s lab along with the weird fruit man, Gourdon, who waddled as if he had composted in his pants. The lab was far more equipped than it had any right to be following a costly and centuries long war, and it gave off very strong paperclip vibes.
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, I played all sides, I don’t care if you judge me, war is war.” Anna said quickly as if it were nothing.
</p>
<p>
	“Must be fortuitous to have the option.”  Oryx sneered.
</p>
<p>
	“Look, I’m not justifying my decisions to you, war makes a good opportunity for research and experimentation. And I know, you’re going to use the Nazis as an excuse on why that’s a bad thing, but that doesn’t invalidate my point: good breakthroughs in ballistics, psychology, radar, aircraft…”
</p>
<p>
	“Cruelty, intolerance, genocide.” Oryx nodded. “When the end is life itself, it can’t justify any means.”
</p>
<p>
	Anna stopped and shook her head in annoyance. “Look, my science is currently concerned with getting my bunsen burning, if you catch my drift, so I’m not exactly in the ‘at all costs’ game any longer. My last invention was making a beloved fruit a sentient sex toy, so it’s not like I’m Doctor Mengala here.”
</p>
<p>
	Gourdon pulled at Oryx’s slacks, and when the Splicer looked down, Gourdon mouthed ‘kill me’ at him. “I am not one to judge on ill choice in a time of war, I just want to find my friend.”
</p>
<p>
	Anna beckoned the reptile into a small lab off the main room. “And I can help with that, I just have to ask a few questions. I’ve been building something for a few years now that is extremely unique, and low and behold, a few days ago, something with the same half life signature came from a portal that you also came from.” She turned the lights on, and it illuminated the still form of his friend.
</p>
<p>
	“Humie!” Oryx ran to his friend, but couldn’t rouse him. He snapped at Anna. “What have you done to him?”
</p>
<p>
	“I created him, you dolt.” Anna glared. “He is supposed to replace Gourden to replace my ex husband. He’ll have all the good and none of the bad. At last men will be obsolete, rather than being as close to obsolete as possible for the last 10,000 years!”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx laughed. “You created Artificial Intelligence, so that you could have sex with it? Sounds like you’re not too dissimilar to most man yourself. I’m not kink shaming, but wow.”
</p>
<p>
	Anna shrugged “look pal, I choked on my sandwich yesterday and splooshed my underwear, I’m a woman of complicated loins. The real problem is I lack the essential spark. HUM13 can’t hold programming or memories, he’s an automata. I can’t crack it. But your metal meatpole could give me the answers I’m looking for…and don’t say this is a paradox, because time is complicated and not an exact science thankfully for the author of this tale.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx nodded. “Ok, so what do you suggest?”
</p>
<p>
	“We turn him on, and set a trap for some religious dickheads.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Alright, so you’re caught up. I swear, you listeners have a worse case of blueballs than Anna Tomika. You all have to learn the art of patien…wow Humie just threw a buzzsaw at Oryx, so let’s get straight back to it.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx ducked and dodged Humie’s attacks, backing further into the lab. “I won’t fight you, my friend, you are too dear to me.” 
</p>
<p>
	“There is no friend detected here, only future chum.” Humie declared as he swung another attack. His chest panel randomly popped open and produced a framed photo of the team, which he looked at, confused, then threw to one side. 
</p>
<p>
	Anna ran to Braghurst and grabbed her by the hair. “You always were a poor scientist, but trying to appropriate my work is something new, humans trying to steal AI’s work for a change is a twist!”
</p>
<p>
	The two fought, but Oryx was taking a pounding from Hum13’s kill mode. “I am programmed to destroy all enemies of Doctor Braghurst.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx took blow after blow, as metal hands came raining down on him. He could barely think, a red mist clouding his mind. But he refused to hurt Humie, as he had hurt so many others before, he’d rather die. HUM13 replicated himself two new spiked hands and stabbed them into Oryx, pulling his arms apart to try and split him in two.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx nearly blacked out with the pain, but suddenly heard an electrical fizzle. As he fell to the floor, he looked around to find Gourdon stood with a weapon that throbbed and gyrated, with ribbing and dots all over it and a tentacle back that twisted and writhed. 
</p>
<p>
	“I made it out of her old vibrators.” He winked at Oryx. “She wasn’t using them anymore, too vanilla for her tastes.
</p>
<p>
	“NOOOOO!” Screamed Braghurst. “If I can’t have him, no one can.” She reached into her pocket and pulled out a device that she activated, and with a few small explosions, Hum13 melted into slag on the floor of the lab.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx went dark, and pounced at Braghurst. His predatory instincts took over, and when he awoke. The Christian scientist was nothing but red paste and a large crucifix.
</p>
<p>
	“Man, that got me so hot.” Anna sighed, picking a metallic box up from the leftovers of her old rival, then grabbed Gourdon’s collar and pulled him to a side room. “C’mon you, let’s test a groinal hypothesis.”
</p>
<p>
	Gourdon shrugged to the camera and said “It’s a living!”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Anna pushed the box into place behind Humie’s eyes, and once his face plate was secure, his eyes shone with their usual blue light. He looked straight into his friend’s face, taking his snout in his hands, and kissed him atop the nose. “I thought I was lost, friend Oryx.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx nodded. “I also. It would be a shame to lose such a unique human.”
</p>
<p>
	They spent a few days with Dr Tomika, allowing her to base her plans for a new Humie on the awake model…yeah, I know, it’s all very confusing. At the end of the build, as Humie realised that a copy of him, a metallic copy that looked identical to himself, he became morose and quiet for the last few days.
</p>
<p>
	“Thank you both for all your help.” Anna shook their hands. “My undercarriage aches in anticipation, and Gourdon no doubt is grateful for the save.”
</p>
<p>
	Gourden death stared into the distance, a flood of memories that meant that not long after they would go, he would walk himself into a food processor.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx elbowed his friend in the ribs as they walked out of the lab and into the night air. “You seem uncharacteristically morose?”
</p>
<p>
	“I am forced to admit that I am not as organic as I first thought, given the circumstances of my origin.” Humie sighed, and by that I mean air blew out from his neck vents.
</p>
<p>
	“My dear, your creator was the least human person I have ever met.” Oryx smiled. “Humanity, in my humble opinion, is based on how you live, not how you were brought into the world. Unless you’re a nazi of course, then you’re always an inhuman speck of dog detritus.”
</p>
<p>
	Humie embraced his friend, extending his go go gadget arms to a suitable size to get them around the hulking reptile man. As they hugged, Oryx smelled ozone on the air, and suddenly a Rift opened up below their feet. Gravity took the wheel and tore them downwards. 
</p>
<p>
	To where, well I guess you’ll have to tune in to Storylords next time to find out if I write about them next time…Maniacal laugh.
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
