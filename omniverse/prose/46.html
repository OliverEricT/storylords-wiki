	S2 Episode 20 - Say Cheese and Fuck Off

<p>
	Prompts: Cheese and Tournaments
</p>
<p>
	By Rich Masters
</p>
<p>
	Florgo strode into the Greywoods office, in a house once belonging to the deceased Etty Amray, with all the swagger and excitement of Richard Gere at a small pet shop. As Lady Greywood spread jam (yeah yeah yeah, I don’t care what you call it, I’m British, I’m not fucking google translate, don’t @ me, I genuinely couldn’t give a shit. I will KILL YOU BRO!) on a piece of toast, Florgo placed the head of the Pillar of Ilima named The Will on her husband’s desk, leaking blood all over his wartime maps. “New paperweight for you. Careful, it rolls.”
</p>
<p>
	“Did she know anything about Kellan’s location, Grorp?” Jiran Greywood raised an eyebrow. “Or did you even question her before you chopped this one’s head off?”
</p>
<p>
	“I remind you again, it’s Florgo now. I remember what was done to me.” Florgo glared coldly. “I asked your damn questions. If you want I can go get a fucking Quija board and you can ask her yourself? This one was hiding in the 1960s trying to combat free love and drugs with her religious nonsense. I found her hiding out in a church.”
</p>
<p>
	Lady Greywood winced, disgusted. “You killed her while she was praying? I think I liked you better when you were a rhyming little goblin.” 
</p>
<p>
	Florgo smiled. “It was only a shame she wasn’t sleeping, or taking a shit. Look, you wanted them dead, they’re dead. Is it better for your conscience if we give her some sort of hopeless delusion of getting away? What next?”
</p>
<p>
	The Greywoods shared a look that said this new, psychotic Florgo might become a problem. “We tried to recall the Word and the Wraith, but they aren’t responding. Probably wise to our plans now.” Jiran said.
</p>
<p>
	“The more of them I kill, the more attuned I am to the Rifts thanks to Kellan opening one up inside of me. I’ll find the Word and the Wraith, wherever they’re hiding in time. Then I’ll find Kellan.”
</p>
<p>
	“No.” Lady Greywood said as she took a bite of her breakfast. “ Kellan and her reprobates are causing enough problems in the timestream as it is. Just this morning we observed a timeline where Harry Potter was a well written book and not a propaganda engine with nothing but copy paste ideas and badly concealed racism, can you believe it? This golden thread, this prime timeline, is becoming untethered. You’re likely to do more damage if you start fighting her.”
</p>
<p>
	Florgo laughed. “How could you two old coffin dodgers know that?”
</p>
<p>
	They turned to him and smiled, their faces shifting as if a mask previously imperceptible to Grorp had fallen off. They weren’t the Greywoods anymore, they were different people entirely, younger, more vibrant. Wearing lab coats “Because we’re the ones that caused this mess in the first place. I’m Doctor James Kendall, this is my wife and fellow Chronophysicist Dr Big Sue Campbell. We’re time travellers, Florgo. We developed the Rift technologies and used them to fuck around and make ourselves rich and powerful in any timeline or reality we lay out hat or Sue’s giant strap-on. Usually, every timeline we live in eventually destroys itself due to the natural order wanting to expel us but being ultimately unable to. We use…various methods…to scope out future escape routes and set them up years in advance, so it wasn’t an issue to us.”
</p>
<p>
	Big Sue demolished the last of her toast and then went on. “When a timeline is about to rip itself to shreds we just move along. But after we arrived here, the prime timeline, something happened to the Omniverse, some great shift where the forces of entropy and potential were somehow and statistically impossibly put completely in balance. We found we couldn’t Rift out again, as if our abilities had been cauterised. All we can do is go back to the start of our time here. That’s why we tell you not to worry about Kellan.”
</p>
<p>
	Florgo shook his head. “Look this is supposed to be a comedy story, this rampant exposition makes everyone - A: sleepy and B: thinking you’re out for a Pulitzer because they want more peepeepoopoo jokes. Why should we not worry?”
</p>
<p>
	Dr Kendall smiled. “Because Kellan always comes back. Just before the end of the universe.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Kellan sat at the breakfast table, just as a sullen Asher pulled her school bag off the chair and stormed towards the door. 
</p>
<p>
	“Wait, Ash.” Kellan called, as Ash rolled her eyes and turned around. “I’m sorry ok? I didn’t mean to imply that doom metal was a phase you were going through. I shouldn’t dismiss your interests because I think they’re shiiiiiiiiiii…mply not something I enjoy.”
</p>
<p>
	Ash bit her lip, every part the surly 16 year old goth, her black lipstick reflecting the halogen kitchen lights. “You’ve been a grade A bitchzilla these last few weeks, you know that? If you're in one of your funks, why don’t you get out of the house, go get your running shoes on and go for a jog or something?”
</p>
<p>
	“Hey young lady, that is an anti Kellan word we don’t use in this house.”
</p>
<p>
	Ash sneered. “What, ‘Bitch’?”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan shook her head “Jogging.” She forced a ten dollar bill into Asher’s hand in lieu of lunch and patted her shoulder. “I’m just tense. Anniversary of escaping that hell dimension. Of Florgo. Can’t shake the feeling something’s going to happen, a giant crocodile, or a demon, or maybe robohitler for a third time.”
</p>
<p>
	Ash sighed and put a hand to her sister’s. “You changed the past, sis, maybe that stuff doesn’t need to happen anymore. It’s been ten years, you’ve built a life for us here. Enjoy it.” She picked up her bag and ran to wait for the bus. “Let sleeping dogs lie!” She called back.
</p>
<p>
	“Incredibly poor choice of words.” Came a voice from the shadows, as a demon dog on four bent out of shape legs came trotting out. 
</p>
<p>
	“Oh Malcolm.” Kellan sighed. “Coffee, kibble, child’s soul to chew on?”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	The Rift tore open and a twin engine Lockheed 10-Electra tore through the hole in space and came to an immediate landing on the field. Oryx and HUM-13 stepped out of the plane and looked at each other, the crocodilian shaking his head as he stripped off the aviation uniform he was bursting out of. “I feel our pact to stay out of history’s way has not really been honoured here, Humie.”
</p>
<p>
	HUM-13 looked up, dressed in a woman’s aviator’s uniform with a blonde wig on. “The Rift was over the pacific, we needed a way through. Not all of us are so seaworthy, I rust, like most other humans, my Navi-gator.”
</p>
<p>
	“Next time, I will chose the names. A pilot called ‘Earheart’ is a little derivative, don’t you think?” Oryx said, suddenly noticing that HUM-13’s attention was somewhere else. He turned to find them surrounded by families dressed all in black. Settlers, in black hoods and white lace, standing with pitchforks, shovels and scythes. They stared at the intruders with red eyes. “Humie? Where…or when are we?”
</p>
<p>
	“Temporal sensors suggest 1580s Earth.” HUM-13 declared. “The total theft of North America by the Europeans from those native to these lands.” HUM-13 looked at the camera long and hard.
</p>
<p>
	“They look extremely agitated for people who have just gotten away with wholesale land larceny.” Oryx looked back, realising the plane was parked on a piece of wood. He tore it from the wheel and held the sign in front of him. “Roanoak…” he muttered, before looking at HUM-13, who shrugged.
</p>
<p>
	One settler lunged at HUM-13. “Croatoan!” he said in a low, guttural voice.
</p>
<p>
	“You must be mistaken, sir, my name is Humie.” HUM-13 dodged, as the others approached, mumbling the same word. “Though I don’t think this is simply a case of mistaken identity.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	“Still just sittin’ eh?” Malcolm walked on hind legs to the table in that weird way that cats do that make them look like some sort of Soviet era mech. “Is this a depressive episode, or are you getting into your sweats and daytime television period?”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan watched him, something about this weird talking lizard dog thing that made her stomach turn. What was it…oh yes, it was that he was a weird talking lizard dog thing. “I told you, Malcolm, I’m not going back.”
</p>
<p>
	As he pulled himself up to sit at the table, he sent a long tongue out to the fruit bowl and pulled a banana into his mouth, swallowing it whole, peel and all. A long trail of viscous drool slathered over the table, but he noticed Kellan’s look of disgust. “Oh drool is too much for you, but killing billions in a time jaunt around the multiverse is fine. Excuse me, Duchess.” He sucked the drool up like a strand of spaghetti.
</p>
<p>
	“Is this the next tall tale in an effort to convince me to go back home?” Kellan smirked. “You’ve tried everything, Malcolm - promises, threats, that weird interpretive dance you did.”
</p>
<p>
	“Hey! You said that was quirky!” Malcolm exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
	“I was trying to be nice.” Kellan smiled. “Look, I’ve got a real chance here to keep Asher from turning into a killing machine, away from demons raising her.”
</p>
<p>
	“At the expense of how many?” Malcolm’s long tongue licked his lips.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan tapped the table with her fist. “I don’t care.”
</p>
<p>
	“I might be a simple omni-dimensional Eldritch nightmare dog, but that seems unlikely as an honest man in congress.” Malcolm said. “The reason you’re here is entirely cause ya care too much. About your people, your friends, your family. I watched you cry last week because you ran out of cheese.”
</p>
<p>
	“An entirely understandable human response!” Kellan said. 
</p>
<p>
	“I’d agree with you there, kid, if’n I got a weakness, it’s a bit of cheese, just like any other hound dog or eldritch abomination.”
</p>
<p>
	“Look, Malcolm, I want an easier life. It’s too much weight on one person’s shoulders”
</p>
<p>
	Malcolm put his paws together and rotated his dew claws over each other. “Bullhocky and fiddlesticks, kid. ‘Oh look, I’m a duchess with everything I ever wanted who at the first sign of hardship, buckles at the knees quicker than a $5 hooker or the average listener’s mother.’ I wouldn’t mind, but it’s not you suffering. The whole Omniverse is collapsing, the Omniverse I live in, an Omniverse of killing and suffering and snausages. I’ll miss those things!” 
</p>
<p>
	Kellan pinched the bridge of her nose, feeling a headache coming along. “If you care so much, why don’t you sort it out?”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, I am.” Malcolm filed his sharp talons with the underside of his tongue, which was rough and grooved. “I gave you a chance, you turned me down. I only ask so many times and then I tend to just tip the board over and smash all the pieces like a little kid when they lose. Either that or I empower a tyrannical dimension hopping Skeletor/Dr Doom hybrid to destroy the entirety of creation. I’m such a full tilt diva. Anyhoooooo, I didn’t come to have our usual battle of wits, I’ve found another champion to rectify the imbalance - your old pal Florgo can do it for me.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan narrowed her eyes. “You can’t, he’s not himself. He’s so full of anger and rage, he’ll destroy everything.”
</p>
<p>
	“So? Look kid, I don’t give a good dog-damn whether life continues or not, just that the whole ‘verse doesn’t implode. You didn’t wanna do it, so I gave Florgo the keys to existence, and lemme tell ya, that boy is a man with a fork in a world of soup. He’ll burn it all down. Either way, I get what I want - a reset to the status quo.”
</p>
<p>
	“No. I won’t let you. I’ll do it, I’ll go back.” Kellan begged.
</p>
<p>
	Malcolm smiled. “No, you won’t. You’ll stay exactly where you are, out of the way.”
</p>
<p>

<p>
	HUM-13 stepped out of another portal holding a rifle, while his friend was dressed as a Dallas police officer. Oryx was covered in blood, though HUM-13 could barely see him in the pea soup of a fog, barely registering the sound of bells in the wind.
</p>
<p>
	“I assured you I could make that bullet curve with simple magneton generators.” HUM-13 said, matter of factly. “I am what the informed would call, a bad mother fucker, brrrrrap brrrrrap. That was onomatopoeia, Oryx.” 
</p>
<p>
	Oryx frowned. “Surely the crackshot that you are could have avoided the trajectory that coated me with another’s blood.” He used his clawed hand to wipe viscera off his uniform.
</p>
<p>
	“I did, but I thought it would be humorous.” HUM-13 said, unemotionally, he felt his stablisers kick in and he corrected himself so as not to fall.
</p>
<p>
	“Do you think the humans will ever know their president was simply a meat puppet with a small alien piloting him?” Oryx muttered, wafting his hand to see better in the fog.
</p>
<p>
	HUM-13 shook his head, then took a step, oak creaking underfoot. “No, I’ll assume not. But I have a question for you - do you think there’s any risk forming of due to us having these largely off camera super entertaining aventures, that there might be something playing out elsewhere that is largely boring and exposition laden to get our story back on track after ten weeks of time hopping hijynx?”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx took another step and slammed into a rail. He felt the otherside of the ledge, where he felt a metal nameplate. The Mary Celeste. “That seems very dubio…” Oryx said, as a thick tentacle wrapped around his waist.
</p>
<p>
	“Meat for the drowned god! The mammoth sea creature spluttered as it lifted its maw out of the water, it’s gargantuan tentacles
</p>
<p>
	HUM-13 stepped forward, knocking over a stack of harpoons. He picked one up and turned to the monster. “I’m going to send you back to Davy Jones, you hideous calamari beastie.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t get it,” said Kellan. “You wanted me to go back - you finally convince me to give up a chance at normality - and then you refuse?”
</p>
<p>
	“Ain’t I a stinker?” Malcolm smirked, his large fangs glinting the light back at Kellan.
</p>
<p>
	Lunging across the table, Kellan went to attack him, but he slithered away around the table. He laugh-howled. “Grab me? Was that your grand plan? I’m a god for hell's sake, not your kindergarten boyfriend. What were you going to do, noogie me, maybe gimme a mean swirly?”
</p>
<p>
	“I need to go back, and you’re not going to stop me.” Kellan said opening a Rift where Malcolm was, but he was gone. She felt a panting at her shoulder, before his tongue wrapped around her and threw her across the room.
</p>
<p>
	“Gawd, you’re annoying! You ain’t never happy, girl. This way you get to stay hidden away and play happy families with your sister. And all it costs you is everything else you ever knew, every friend you had, and any answers you ever wanted about your real parents…” He put a taloned, lizard paw to his expression of mock surprise, causing Kellan to stop dead in her tracks. “Oooops, did I say that?” He pulled a piece of paper from behind her ear, party magician style. “Maybe the next step in getting your answers is on this scrap of paper. And maybe, if you sit still and let what’s gotta happen happen. I’ll give it to you at the end, as a closing text crawl for the end of your world.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan shook her head. “No, you don’t know that, nobody does. Nobody could…”
</p>
<p>
	“Nobody except maybe the gods?” Malcolm smirked. 
</p>
<p>
	“You’re no, god, you’re just another mangy mutt.” Kellan pulled a small, yellow cube from her pocket and threw it in the air. She watched as Malcolm’s nose twitched, and his eyes closed. He wafted in the air after the yellow cube like Pepe Le Pew on his way to sexually assault a cat with white paint on it, or frat boys sniffing out your horny, sex starved mother before they never call her again.
</p>
<p>
	“If’n I got a weakness, it’s a bit of cheese.”
</p>
<p>
	“...it’s a bit of cheese.”
</p>
<p>
	“...BIT OF CHEESE.”
</p>
<p>
	The echo was almost tangible in the room, and who could say it wasn’t, and not just because you all need reminding of the throwaway line I used to shoehorn in this prompt this week. With Malcolm following his treat, Kellan opened Rift after Rift in the room, so many that even he couldn’t dodge them. He was instantly severed in two, thick black viscous blood oozing out of the open wound. Both parts dropped to the floor and he hissed and spat like a dying monster. “You cut me in two! You know how hard it’s going to be to find one of those doggie jackets that fit now? And winter is coming man! You could have at least Old Yeller’d me like a human being.”
</p>
<p>
	She snatched the piece of paper from his paw and opened it. It simply said a time and a place. A crackle of electricity stood her hair on end as a Rift opened before her. The realisation of what she was leaving behind hit her. But she knew that Ash would know what to do to keep herself safe. Still, fuck him for making her do this. With one last fury filled look at Malcolm, she stepped through the portal.
</p>
<p>
	After she was gone, Malcolm sat up and beckoned his lower half towards him, and watched as his back end knitted itself back onto his front. “Neato.” He said with a sick smile.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Oryx stepped through another portal in full Scottish regalia, kilt and sporran flapping in the desert wind. Behind him, HUM-13 had fashioned a large dinosaur head to cover his own.
</p>
<p>
	“Alright, this one even I couldn’t see a reason for.” HUM-13 said.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx shook his head. “Does a species that thinks a full sized plesiosaur can hide in 50 square kilometers of water even deserve saving?”
</p>
<p>
	HUM-13 pressed a button on his chest plate and small sunglasses were prepared in his printer. He passed a pair to Oryx before fitting his own, then looked up into the desert sun. “Still, fun though.”
</p>
<p>
	“More enjoyable than anything else occurring parallel to our predicament, I wager. Well if they want excitement they should really give more feedback.” Oryx said completely stone faced and unambiguously. “Humie? Why didn’t you let me be Nessie?”
</p>
<p>
	“You lack the gravitas for such a performance, lovey.” HUM-13 said as they walked into the distance, towards a vast set of tents that were erected for what looked like a vast sporting event.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	The clanging of sword and shield rang out far above the roaring of the crowd as Kellan stepped through the portal to emerge behind a tent. ‘Ilima, Megadeth Plains, Fallow Tournament.’ the note had said.  Competitions such as this were only held at occasions of great importance. Maybe her real parents were here, maybe they were competing, either way, she needed to get some attention from the higher ups.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m telling you, Lisella,...hic…if that sword isn’t in my hand soon, I’ll ..hic…pull off your skin and use your spine as a sword.” A large set man barked at his page from a bench outside the beer tent that had been set up, swilling ale from a tankard made from the skull of his former page. 
</p>
<p>
	“You’re too smashed to fight, you impotent little turd.” Lisella whispered as she pulled the tournament entry slip from the bag as she looked for the weapon she knew he had lost yesterday when he had tried juggling to show off to a passing maiden’s carriage before cutting his hand and throwing the sword into a ravine in a fit of rage. “The only sword you put in your hand is that shrivelled little dick of yours.”
</p>
<p>
	Lord Dankfoot stink eyed the page. “What did you say, girl?”  
</p>
<p>
	Lisella mock saluted. “I said, ‘You’ll smash the opposition, you hunkly stud of a Lord, you. Your prowess on the field is only matched by your prowess in your many sexual conquests’ beds.” Lisella said before turning back to her bag and catching the eye of Kellan. 
</p>
<p>
	“You’re damn right you did.” slurred Dankfoot.
</p>
<p>
	“You ok?” Kellan whispered.
</p>
<p>
	“I won’t be in about half an hour.” Lisella sighed. “This walking advert for birth control always does this, he enters tournies, gets blind drunk, then his page has to fill in. He’s gone through more pages than JK Rowling trying to justify her inherent racism. I’m going to be crushed in about five seconds. Only the toughest enter to be the new Wrath. I don’t even know who we’re fighting because of these secret ballots. It could be Angus McPagefucker for all I know.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan saw her chance. “I’ll stand in for you.”
</p>
<p>
	Lisella’s head jerked back in surprise. “Why? Why would you do this for me?” 
</p>
<p>
	“If I win, I’ll get close to the people that matter.” Kellan said with a grin.
</p>
<p>
	Lisella threw her hands in the air. “What is with you people? Is there something in the water that makes you all mule-brained?”
</p>
<p>
	A clatter came from behind them as Lord Dankfoot fell off his seat and collapsed in an unconscious pile on the floor.
</p>
<p>
	“Leave it with me.” Kellan said as she took the entry slip from Lisealla, slipping a war helm over her face and lifting Doomcock to her shoulder. “I’ll be back with that trophy, and you’ll be rewarded, I promise.”
</p>
<p>
	“I won’t hold my breath.” Lisella shouted after her as Kellan walked off. “Apart from..you know…to naturally avoid the smell of horse shit and entrails”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Oryx and HUM-13 sat in the stands, watching the tournament they had happily stumbled across, two people fought in a central ring of stone, one with a shield and mace, one with a set of gauntlets that were made of pure plasma.
</p>
<p>
	“This next confrontation should be most entertaining,” said Oryx as he hunched forward in his chair. “Do we have any snacks?”
</p>
<p>
	HUM-13 pressed a button on his chest panel, his central door opening up to reveal a plate of nachos. With nachos in hand, he twisted a nipple nut to squirt sour cream, then the other nipple nut for a thick drizzle of guacamole. “Would you like chunky salsa?”
</p>
<p>
	“Ye…”Oryx started before he thought about where the condiment might come from next. “No thank you Humie, that will be sufficient. This fellow with mace and shield looks a tough contender.”
</p>
<p>
	“His competitor has apparently won the last two bouts she has competed in. Her gauntlets produce so much heat they can cleave steel in two.” HUM-13 declared. “This is an anonymous contest, but the crowd have dubbed her ‘Laser Fister’.”
</p>
<p>
	“Woooooo, we love you, Laser Fister!” A member of the crowd screamed. “Have my babies!”
</p>
<p>
	In return, Laser Fister put her hand to her mouth to blow a kiss to the crowd and sliced her face in two. Her body slumped to the floor in a puddle of blood. A bell rang and Macey Man was declared the winner, much to his chagrin, as he looked like the sort of beefed up incel that was up for a fight against a woman. In a huffy rage, he put his skinny jeans and muscle fit t-shirt on and went to listen to a historical Andrew Tate podcast episode.
</p>
<p>
	A voice boomed out over the stands. “And now, a last minute change to our first bracket fight, due to an inebriation related drop out…”
</p>
<p>
	“…Coincidentally the terminology used for a prom night dumpster baby.” HUM-13 said, before looking at the disgusted face of Oryx. He checked a switch on his back and then flipped it. “Ah, I see the problem, my poor taste switch was turned on.”
</p>
<p>
	“First to enter the ring of pain, a Norn/Velitean who, though anonymous, will need no introduction.”
</p>
<p>
	A stomping of robotic legs resounded around the stands, shaking drinks and nearly spilling Oryx’s plate of nachos over the person in front of him. Out from behind a curtain came a monstrosity of technical, humanoid and animal parts. A robo centaur with a long spear and giant antlers bound around the ring of stones, kicking and stomping.
</p>
<p>
	“...and his competition in our first bracket fight. The page of a competitor that disrespected our noble traditions and couldn’t be bothered to show up.”
</p>
<p>
	The crowd booed as a small, unassuming woman stepped out from behind another curtain, dragging something through the mud.
</p>
<p>
	“How dare they?” Shouted one patron.
</p>
<p>
	“Disrespected our institutions.” Called another.
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t know what we’re all shouting about, but I’m weak willed so will hate what you tell me to hate.” Shouted another.
</p>
<p>
	“I predict this fight will be over very quickly.”  HUM-13 said over the din of the crowd booing and insulting the woman,
</p>
<p>
	Oryx tapped his friend on the shoulder, then pointed to the ring. “I’m not so sure, Humie. Does that thing she’s dragging look familiar to you?”
</p>
<p>
	The woman flipped the warhammer known as Doomcock around until it was brandished in front of her.
</p>
<p>
	“Friend Kellan.” HUM-13 muttered before turning to his neighbour and getting his attention. “Excuse me sir, what is the point of this tournament?”
</p>
<p>
	The spectator tutted. “Duh, don’t you know this is the tournament to pick the new Wrath?”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Kellan tried not to piss pants as she stared down this refugee from Doom and waited for the fight to start. 
</p>
<p>
	The referee, a small droid that somewhat resembled C3P0 but just better - because I’m sick of writing this story now - pointed to the royal box, Kellan’s attention raised with the droid’s finger. In the best seats in the house, in a set of seats watching the tournament, was the Amray family. Her mother Etty, her father Korvis, and her once older brother Targus, who was no older than two.
</p>
<p>
	“Mum? Dad?” She whispered, just as the bell rang and a spear came hurtling towards her.
</p>
<p>
	TO BE CONTINUED
