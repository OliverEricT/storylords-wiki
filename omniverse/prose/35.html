<p>
	“Come forward.” 
</p>
<p>
	Grorp walked to the dias, a smile as narrow as your average cop’s reasoning for a random stop and search - aka “Non white? Sure!” He had waited a long time for this, his machinations, his support of the Greywoods, his disposal of the last Wrath, it had all led to this moment. As he stood before the stone structure, he was felt with a satisfaction that he had never known. He had paid a price for his weasley betrayal of Wrath, the last action of the previous pillar had been to injure his brain in such a way that he could only talk in rhyme. (now I know what you’re thinking, “C‘mon Rich, that’s a bit far fetched”. Well my psychology deprived fellows, have you ever read any Oliver Sachs? If not, I’d suggest you don’t unless you want to know just how badly your brain can fuck up from a seemingly innocuous bonk on the head.) Hiding as some hunched freak - his words not mine - for the last ten years had been tough, though it had helped him set up a side hustle in shakespearean theatre. 
</p>
<p>
	“Chase Grorp. Do you accept the mantle that will be laid upon you?” Jiran Greywood lifted the helm over Grorp’s head.
</p>
<p>
	“I will.” he said, his words echoing in the empty room. The realisation of the position was making him as excited as when two cousins meet for the first time in South Carolina. Almost as excited as when he killed for money, or for imagined slight, or just because he wanted to. His words echoed in the chamber that was empty except for himself and the Greywoods.
</p>
<p>
	Jiran brough the bear helm down onto his head, which squeaked unceremoniously as it went over his large ears. “Then rise, our new Wrath.” 
</p>
<p>
	Umbra Greywood pressed a button on the intercom embedded in the dias. “Send them in please.”
</p>
<p>
	The large steel doors to the chamber opened inwards with an excruciating slow movement. Once clear, the other Pillars walked in somberly, then stopped at the sight of the man in the bear helm.
</p>
<p>
	“Meet your new Wrath.” Jiran announced.
</p>
<p>
	The Ward, the education Pillar in the owl helm, was the first to break the shocked hush. “The investigation is not complete on the previous Wrath yet, aren’t we jumping the gun a little?”
</p>
<p>
	“Wrath was a traitor, and at this time of war we need stability and power.” Umbra said beside Jiran, her old lady demeanour slightly gone. She was standing upright, confident. “You six will be needed in the coming days. Seven, once we call in Wraith.”
</p>
<p>
	The Lion Helm of the Will, the religious leader, stepped forward.“Of course we’ll be needed, we will have the defence of Ilima to consider.” She spoke with a disdain she normally hid from authority figures. Even she was irritated with the situation, it didn’t matter how much she despised Wrath, it was like losing a sibling you hated. It was complicated.
</p>
<p>
	Jiran held up a hand. “You will be needed to hunt Kellan Amray and her band of traitors through the time stream, and bring her back unspoiled.”
</p>
<p>
	“The Pillars have autonomy in the work that they choose to do” The Writ, the law Pillar in the fox helm said. He was incredulous. “We’re not a hammer to be wielded. We are here for the betterment of society.”
</p>
<p>
	Jiran stepped down from the dias and rounded the stone structure to stand alongside Grorp. “That was before one of you decided to kill General Amray. You are here for the betterment of Ilima. And now you are answerable to Wrath, who answers to us.”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath stepped forward and lifted his helm, to the gasps of the other Pillars. Removing your helm was sacrosanct. “Grorp?” The Way, the science pillar in the stag helm, summed up the groups astonishment at their old manservant becoming their peer - not to mention his lack of hobbling and bending. “How is this possible?”
</p>
<p>
	“The wheel that spins has many teeth,
</p>
<p>
	And karma stings those underneath.
</p>
<p>
	When lines are toed and dues arranged
</p>
<p>
	It will be easier to accept the change.” 
</p>
<p>
	Group smirked and walked through the group, leaving them looking at each other in shock.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	“So then’s I said, ‘Christmas it may be, but woman, you ain’t half the man ah am - on account of her being a cut off at the leg cripple and all - so do yourself a favour and get back in that damn kitchen and make my lunch, before ah show you a taste of mah arm foot’.” Deputy Gooch Clementine said through teeth that were a result of inbreeding and opening beer bottles with his mouth, an act he called budilingus. (Budweiser, don’t feel like you can take that as a slogan or anything, I’m very litigious.)
</p>
<p>
	“What did Shelly say to that?” In the car alongside him, Sheriff Brett Crawford sat, trying to navigate through a freak South Carolina blizzard on their way to the three day old crime scene in their piece of shit 1968 Buick Riviera with the fake leather seats and the interior that made it look like the result of an Atari 2600 roughfucking a wonky shopping cart. The state had never seen anything like it, a monster of a white christmas coinciding unnaturally with this crimewave. 
</p>
<p>
	“She said it was her house, and that if I didn’t like it I could go live at the station with all the other undesirables.” Gooch grunted, he did a lot of that monosyllabic communication. “She might be my sister and my mother, but she ain't the boss a me.” 
</p>
<p>
	Sheriff Crawford smirked. “She’d probably make more money if you left home, on account of her natural talent for renting out her bed to every man inside county lines. Maybe she can make some dollar out of your bed too.” 
</p>
<p>
	“You mean like a hostel?” Gooch squinted. 
</p>
<p>
	Crawford shook his head. “Yeah, exactly, Gooch. What started the argument in the first place?”
</p>
<p>
	Gooch snorted. “She was sore on account o’ me losing my David Bowie knife. You know, the one with the naked ladies on the handle?”
</p>
<p>
	“I told you before, it’s just a bowie knife, you deficient.” Crawford smiled, before he saw something move against the blizzard about half a mile up the road. “Hey Gooch, what’s that up there at the police tape?”
</p>
<p>
	Gooch lunged forward to see, smacking his face into the glass. “Looks like a couple of lookie-lou kids to me. I’ll load the shotgun.”
</p>
<p>
	“Calm down, Cock-lumbo.” Crawford shook his head as the car screeched to a halt alongside two kids. He opened the door as two teenagers were peering over the police tape at the side of the forest tree line - the scene of Brian Macguffin’s gruesome slaughter not three days ago, the latest in a string of five grisly teen murders. As the door slammed, the two teens turned around, strangers in their small town of Little Happens.  “What are you kids doing, here?”
</p>
<p>
	“What business is it of yours?” The girl responded with the kind of smug sneer only a young kid could muster.
</p>
<p>
	Gooch lifted the gun and pointed it at them. One was a dark-skinned male, which Gooch realised made him a prime suspect already, and the girl was uppity and he didn’t like that one iota. “Best you two come with us.” He said.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	“Remind me why I came with you.” Florgo whispered to Kellan inside the holding cell they both occupied, looking at a missing poster of a teenage boy called Layton Burns.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan pulled on the bars to test their strength. “Because you saw me sneak out, and I couldn’t trust you not to narc to Oryx or Asher? We Rifted here for a reason, and I think these murders were it.”
</p>
<p>
	“This isn’t Quantum Leap, Kellan! Not everything has to be a mission for you to solve.” Florgo shook his head.
</p>
<p>
	He had a point, they had inserted themselves into a number of situations that they didn’t need to over the past four months, not always to a positive resolution, like when they accidentally showed John Wilkes Booth to the box office. “Florgo, you were the one that said I had to focus on morality, I’m just trying to…”
</p>
<p>
	The door to the bullpen burst open and two trenchcoated and sunglass wearing fools entered the room and made for Deputy Clementine’s desk. The woman slammed her FBI identification down, knocking over his Pan Am model plane onto the model of the World Trade Centre he had ordered to commemorate its opening last year. “Hey, you’ve ruined mah model building!”
</p>
<p>
	Over the other side of the precinct, making his one phone call, a man saw the scene play out and whispered down the phone. “Osama! Osama! It’s Marvin. Your cousin Marvin Bin Laden. You know that new vibe you’re looking for? Well listen to this!”
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t worry, Deputy, tin toys cannot crush steel beams. I’m Agent Asher, this is Agent Hallgrim.” The agent said in a vaguely Russian accent. “I’m here for those incredibly stupid children.” Asher pointed to Kellan and Florgo, their stomachs sinking.
</p>
<p>
	Crawford got up from the neighbouring desk and stood between Asher and Gooch, who looked like he might be readying himself to say something that would’ve gotten him beaten up by this mean looking woman. “Name’s Brett Crawford, Ma’am, this is Gooch Clementine. We might’ve been a mite jumpy bringing these two in, but there’s been a string of mutilations, full on last testament shit. We had to ask these gawkers some questions. Strangers rubbernecking at a recent murder scene, seemed sensible to detain them.”
</p>
<p>
	“More sensible than these two twats anyway.” Agent Hallgrim gave the two teens the death stare. “They’re our little field agents, Sheriff. Were supposed to gather some info without dropping us in it. But now we’re having to get involved, aren’t we, you pair of berks?”
</p>
<p>
	“Buddy, what’s with all the metal on your face?” Gooch asked, pointing to the metal plating all over Hallgrim’s head.
</p>
<p>
	“Errrrr…Vietnam.” Hallgrim muttered. “They made me play russian roulette with my squadmates Bobby DeNero and Christopher Walken. Took a shot to the face and had to have plates put in.”
</p>
<p>
	Gooch winced. “Poor bastard. I couldn’t go on account of my totally real and not made up shin splints. Crawford did two tours though.” 
</p>
<p>
	Crawford hated when Gooch served vicariously through him. “9th Infantry, mostly in Hue.”
</p>
<p>
	“No Hue.” Hallgrim smirked. “I was in the 69th, outta your mum’s butt. Enough reminiscing, we need those kids.”
</p>
<p>
	Asher stared at Crawford, he was as attractive a man as she had seen, and she lacked the nuance of flirting after spending her formative years in a demon dimension, which is how I imagine Lauren Boebert learned to seduce men.
</p>
<p>
	“I’ll go talk to the chief.” Crawford turned, abashed at Ahsers staring, and headed towards the office in the corner of the room. 
</p>
<p>
	Gooch grimaced. “But, Sheriff, the chief is going to be a bit antsy, given....”
</p>
<p>
	“I know, I know, but he’ll wanna know the feds are here.” Crawford knocked and entered, as Asher headed to the cell. 
</p>
<p>
	“You should be grateful that HUM13 is good at forging ID.” Asher whispered. 
</p>
<p>
	“Does that say FPI? And why does it say ‘totally real human identification’ underneath?” Florgo asked with a raised brow.
</p>
<p>
	Asher put the ID away, with a huff. “No one likes smart arse, Florgo.”
</p>
<p>
	Wild guttural animal noises came from the Chief’s office, as ungodly as Hallgrim had ever heard. Emerging five minutes later with a frown, Crawford picked up his hat and coat. “The kids stay here until the murderer is found. Chief says if you help, the kids go free.”
</p>
<p>
	“Fascists keeping harmless, innocent kids detained for no reason?” Hallgrim narrowed his brow. “Sounds like standard police practice to me!”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Oryx took a deep breath and blew it out with a wide grin. It was nice to be out in the wild again after so many days of hiding away. It was beautiful, the snow topped canopies of the trees reflecting the morning light. It made him feel relaxed, at one with nature and the forest.
</p>
<p>
	“”YODEL LEH HI HOOOOO!” HUM13 sounded loudly in his electronic voice, that jarred Oryx and made his neck tense up.
</p>
<p>
	“We are in South Carolina, HUM13, not the Alps.” Oryx turned to find HUM13 in full lederhosen and hiking sticks. Oryx sighed. “And where are you getting all these costumes?”
</p>
<p>
	“I make them.” HUM13 declared broadly, transforming one of his arms into a sewing machine.
</p>
<p>
	“Fascinating,” Oryx declared. “You are truly a versatile…human being. Let’s try to keep the yodelling to a minimum though, we are currently investigating. Asher proclaimed the killings were all located in the vicinity of this…Poe Creek Park. We need to find the culprits, or Kellan and Florgo will rot in a…HUM13, what is this?”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx bent down to find tracks, giant footprints, in the soft mud by the riverside. They were faint but there, an effort to cover them up clear, but clumsy. Four, maybe five sets of tracks walking single file. 
</p>
<p>
	HUM13 bent down. “Looks like large foot prints to me, and you know what they say about men with big feet…do you know, because I am unable to find any congruent data on this analogy? Would you like me to scan for…” 
</p>
<p>
	A resonant clang sounded, and HUM13 collapsed next to Oryx, instantly deactivated. Oryx spun to find a group of ape looking humanoids with clubs. 
</p>
<p>
	“Take him.” One of them said, and the man apes descended on Oryx, beating him into unconsciousness.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Asher and Hallgrim rode in the back of Crawford’s car as Gooch played with the radio until he found a suitably  Christian rock song that he liked. As the idiot tapped the dash like a drum kit, Hallgrim fired a localised static charge at the radio and turned it to the Temptations classic, “Just My Imagination”. Gooch then turned the radio off, complaining that he didn’t like ‘that sort’ of music. As Hallgrim opened his mouth to press him on it, Asher gave him a look that could’ve curdled milk and he stayed quiet.
</p>
<p>
	The car pulled up at a small suburban house that probably looked more quaint than it usually did, due to the snow. The four got out and knocked, only to be confronted by a woman with no teeth and judging by her vacant stare, no formal education or any cranial resistance to the lonely braincell pinballing around her empty head.
</p>
<p>
	“Sheriff Crawford. Gooch.” She nodded. “Who are these two? Funfair make job cuts again?”
</p>
<p>
	“Well it seems the bearded lady didn’t exactly land on her feet!” Hallgrim hit back. “Or her hooves…”
</p>
<p>
	Crawford took his hat off. “Jean, can we come in? These two FBI agents have some questions ‘bout Kacey’s death.”
</p>
<p>
	The woman rolled her eyes, and wafted a hand in Gooch’s direction. “Girl’s dead, what’s there to still talk about? Y’all can come in, Gooch can’t stare at her rack anymore on account that she’s in the ground and alls I have is boys left, least the ones the state hasn’t taken off me.”
</p>
<p>
	“I never done anything inapprop…” Gooch started, but Crawford just followed Jean Browning into her ramshackle house.
</p>
<p>
	“Mother of the year over here.” Hallgrim whispered to Asher. “What I wouldn’t wish for there to be some sort of internet in this time period, I could get the skinny on these people in five seconds.” 
</p>
<p>
	“And immediately get access to some time-appropriate porn?” Asher side-eyed him.
</p>
<p>
	“You know me so well.” Hallgrim walked through the door, dodging the strips of flypaper hanging from the ceiling. Newspaper was lain all over the floor, but no dogs were running around, so Hallgrim assumed it was for the kids. “Lovely place, I saw a double feature on this in Stable monthly.”
</p>
<p>
	“Another example of time appropriate porn?” Asher asked.
</p>
<p>
	 “I read it for the features.” Hallgrim smirked before turning to Mrs Browning. “Was your daughter involved with any unsavoury characters?” He glanced at Gooch, who was picking his ear and then smelling his finger. “More unsavoury than normal I mean.”
</p>
<p>
	“Her and a few hoodlums in the town used to hang around and get drunk on a Friday outside Old Pa Skillet’s Barbershop, ‘Mullet Over’.” Hallgrim sniggered, and Asher even smiled at that. “Someone was buying them beer, but we never found out who. But that was every kid in town.” Jean Browning sat down in her rocking chair and turned her stories on the television.
</p>
<p>
	“And now six kids in that group are dead.” Crawford glared. He never thought much of the Brownings, but Kacey was the best of a bad bunch. She had smarts enough to leave this town one day.
</p>
<p>
	“She was gonna turn up dead anyway. 17 years old and already had more dick than hot dinners, and she had an unhealthy relationship with heathen figures, was giving every penny she earned that coulda come into this house to every celebrity charity appeal going. Probably a bunch a scams.”
</p>
<p>
	“Man, tell me about it. If I had a dollar for every youtube personality that committed charity fraud, I’d have $600,000 that I would keep in a private account until I was found out and then quickly donate to an Alzheimer's charity to try and avoid bad press.” Hallgrim stared at the camera knowingly, even though this was a story and there was no camera in the room.
</p>
<p>
	Asher screwed up her nose. “A charitable daughter, how terrible for you. I’m going to check upstairs before I vomit all over your…lovely home.”
</p>
<p>
	Asher moved upstairs and Crawford followed, heading towards Kacey’s room. As they walked through the door, they were met with a barrage of mowtown, alternative movies, and anti-political posters covering up the pink unicorn wallpaper she had probably not been allowed to change. 
</p>
<p>
	“When most of these kids started going missing, I hoped most of them had just run away.” Crawford muttered. “You see why of course.”
</p>
<p>
	Asher nodded with a smile, then checked the usual hiding places, under the mattress, rim of her wardrobe, in the secret compartment of her jewellery box, but there was nothing - a concern. Asher had not been allowed to be a usual teenager, but even she knew that teens kept secret stashes. Asher went to stand at the window, where a floorboard creaked underfoot. As she turned, she realised Crawford was too close, and was almost nose to nose with him. “I need you to help me with my rug - the one below i mean - I mean under my feet!”
</p>
<p>
	“I know what you mean, Ma’am.” Crawford said as he moved to tug the rug back, allowing Asher to locate the loose board and pull it away. Underneath was a hollow, containing a small box with a month’s supply of weed and a half of a phone number on a scrap of paper. 
</p>
<p>
	“J.G. 803 897…”
</p>
<p>
	The rest of the note had been torn. Asher passed it to Crawford. “Looks like phone number, with part missing.”
</p>
<p>
	Crawford looked at it for a second, recognition on his face. Before Asher could ask him what it was, he looked at her, wide-eyed. “It aint a phone number, though it’s clearly meant to make us think it is. I think it’s a trail marker.” 
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Kellan and Florgo sat on the bullpen bench cuffed together next to a tacky white christmas tree, sharing a can of something called ‘Tab’ and eating some Jell-O pudding pops from the vending machine.
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t think we’re going to have much to do this story.” Florgo sighed. “It’s like the gods couldn’t think of anything to do with us.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m alright with it.” Kellan said through a mouthful of sugar. “About time some of the others pulled their weight, and you really are just an in-joke so far..”
</p>
<p>
	More ungodly grunting came from the Chief’s office, and the huge man was clearly pacing back and forth behind the frosted glass, looking like some found footage documentary of a shaved ape.  The two teens looked at each other. 
</p>
<p>
	On the other side of the bullpen, Asher, Hallgrim and the two lawmen came into the room and headed for Kellan and Florgo. “Any luck?”
</p>
<p>
	“With a family like that the girl might have just mutilated herself.” Asher sneered. “Makes me miss the demon world I was in. Any news from our less conspicuous friends.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan shook her head, though her expression was one of worry. Crawford uncuffed the two teens and then looked at Asher. “I think we need to just search the woods. If we have you with us, it might be a bit easier.”
</p>
<p>
	Asher squinted, and Crawford went on. “Look, I know you think we’re hicks down here, and for the most part I agree with you, but I’m certainly not stupid. You guys ain’t FBI, and Hallgrim’s machine parts ain’t from no Vietnam accident. But if you can help me, I’ll take all the help I can get.”
</p>
<p>
	They got ready to depart, with Florgo not really moving, just eyeballing the Chief’s office.
</p>
<p>
	“You coming, mate?” Hallgrim said. 
</p>
<p>
	“No, you go ahead.” Florgo rubbed his wrists. “There’s something I want to check here.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Oryx awoke to find himself tied up in bonds so tight even he couldn’t break them, if Hallgrim were here he would have enjoyed the sensation. He tried to wriggle free without them noticing, keeping his eyes shut. 
</p>
<p>
	“The dear boy thinks we’re stupid. That we won’t notice a giant crocodile trying to slip his bonds.” A distinctly British voice game from the dark corner of the cave. Oryx opened his eyes, and once he had adjusted to the light, he noticed four giant ape men sitting around a small table playing cribbage. One of them smugly put down his cards before moving a small piece on the board. 
</p>
<p>
	“And that’s the game fellows.” He said, and Oryx noticed he had a small bowler hat atop his head.
</p>
<p>
	“Fine work, Winston, old chap.” Another politely clapped.
</p>
<p>
	One with a monocle stepped forward. “Hello sir, I’m sorry we have been forced to detain you. We just can’t have the local constabulary poking their noses into our affairs until we’re ready to reveal ourselves.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx growled. “You will let me go or I'll…”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m sorry young fellow, but what is it exactly that you will do?” Said Sir Monocle. “I was in the boy scouts - dib dib dib, dob dob dob and all that - Even Sir Reginald Hoofsetter, Lord captain of the South Chumbly Wumbly Knot Tying Association couldn’t undo that one.”
</p>
<p>
	“Spiffing reference there, Sir Thomas!” An apeman with a thin pencil moustache said, raising a china tea cup. “You really hit that one for six. How is old Reggie anyway?” 
</p>
<p>
	“Poor fellow got a spot of gout, had to stop professional tiddlywinking.” Sir Thomas pulled off his monocle and shined it. “Dreadful shame really. He’s prostrate with grief, not dissimilar to your metallic friend over there.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx took the opportunity to twist, pulling one hand partially free, his claws now resting against his bonds. He turned to see HUM13 sat deactivated in the corner, the fools probably thinking they had killed him. All he had to do was to try and slice the ropes and wait until the android could self repair and back him up.
</p>
<p>
	“What are you?” Oryx growled.
</p>
<p>
	Sir Thomas smiled. “Saquatches, Yetis, Abominable Snowmen…although that particular incident was Sir Malcom over there, he gets a bit tetchy in the cold, don’t you know?” The bigfoot in the bowler hat bowed his head in shame. “I think the current consensus is Bigfoot. We were experimented on by the Gerrys during WW2. Those rotters were making cricket men, and moth men, and giant Scottish plesiosaurs, it was all rather frightful. We came home to old blighty and the PM said we’d probably be more at home here, would fit in better in a place like this, that the yanks would probably mistake us for inbreds. But apparently these people aren’t as stupid as we first thought.”
</p>
<p>
	“So you decided to start killing children!?” Oryx worked his claws against the ropes, feeling one of the fibres starting to give.
</p>
<p>
	All four gentlemen Bigfoots, (Bigfeet? I don’t know what the nomenclature is here.) stood and gesticulated wildly, incensenced at the mere accusation. There were a lot of ‘harumphs’, ‘well i nevers’, and ‘how dare yous’.
</p>
<p>
	“Whyever would we kill children?” Sir Malcom put a hand to his chest. “Your school system will do a decent enough job of that eventually, no doubt! There are worse monsters than us in this town, believe you me.”
</p>
<p>
	HUM13 stood suddenly. “I have analysed their speech patterns and can detect no signs of dishonesty, Oryx, nor of adequate dental care. I believe they are telling the truth.”
</p>
<p>
	To their credit, none of the Bigfeet (I’m going with Bigfeet, it just sounds better) seemed shocked, they just nodded wholeheartedly in agreement. 
</p>
<p>
	“So what are you fellows doing in Little Happens?” HUM13 asked.
</p>
<p>
	Sir Thomas untied Oryx, and bade them to join his team at the table. “Well dear boy, it was happenstance. And now those murders are being conveniently pinned on us. We can’t leave this cave, nor dare we try and find a new home. We just want to live as normal Englishmen do - as normal art and sculpture stealing, colonising humans.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx grimaced, he understood all too well the witch hunting that accompanied being different. “I don’t agree with the last bit, but you do deserve to live. We have someone in our group that may be able to take you somewhere without anyone noticing.”
</p>
<p>
	“No!” HUM13 stood up and flipped the cribbage table over, then quickly grabbed the table and pieces and put them back neatly, apologising. “Something has made me feel kinship with these creatures looking for acceptance and not to be seen as less than human, though I know not what it is as I am clearly a stereotypical human. It is not enough that we save them, we must save their very names. There will be a day when the courage of Bigfeet falls, but it is not this day! We will fight them on the beaches, in appropriate swimwear. If not now, when and if not when…” HUM13 looked blankly before weakly muttering. “H…how?” 
</p>
<p>
	Oryx put a hand on HUM13’s shoulder and pushed him down. “Calm yourself there, Braveheart, and let us try and raise Kellan.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Forgo answered the call from Oryx as he was rummaging through the Station Chief's office. Florgo had taken the opportunity to do a little digging after the Chief had sauntered off to the station bathroom. So far he had found bags of clippings of what looked like brown fur, along with two giant boots, covered in mud. From the look of them, the owner must have been seven feet tall at least.
</p>
<p>
	“Oryx, thank the gods. Listen, I think the Chief might be a Bigfoo…”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx interrupted him “Florgo, the miscreant slaughtering these children isn’t in the forest. We’re with some people who saw a beast of a man carving the victims to pieces, he’s a townie!”
</p>
<p>
	The Chief burst in with a guttural roar, to find a young man going through bags of discarded hair and playing with his boots. He was a giant of a thing, and his cromagnonman forehead and underbite made him look like a shaved ape. He approached Florgo in a fury, and Florgo screamed like a toddler.

	The five of them arrived at the Poe Creek Passageway at marker 803 897, a dirt hiking path leading in two directions as sparse as your mum’s little black book, and as long as your dad’s list of reasons for leaving you. 
</p>
<p>
	“I think we need to split up.” Hallgrim said. “Two directions, two teams. I’ll go with Gooch and Kellan, and you two can go investigate and maybe stop this sexual tension and possibly get off my back for five minutes.”
</p>
<p>
	“I will skin you later, Hallgrim.” Asher hissed as Gooch handed radios to the team. Asher and Crawford headed up the track, leaving Hallgrim, Kellan, and Gooch to head down towards a canopy of trees that had created a dark passage into the forest. 
</p>
<p>
	They walked for five minutes, before the air turned notably sour. “Smells like Oryx’s dick.” Hallgrim screwed his face up.
</p>
<p>
	“How would you know what his dick smelled like?” Kellan smirked.
</p>
<p>
	“Hey, any port in a storm, Kellan.” Hallgrim said as he pushed through the brush on the side of the path, only to be confronted with a scene he wasn’t expecting.
</p>
<p>
	There, in front of them, was the splayed and carved open corpse of Layton Burns. It was relatively fresh, no older than a day old, and Hallgrim was surprised that any wild animals hadn’t gotten to him yet. Hallgrim reached for the radio he’d been given and brought it to his mouth. “Asher, get here now…” He stopped, the radio wasn’t transmitting. He turned to Gooch and looked puzzled, only to be hit by the butt of Gooch’s pistol. Hallgrim collapsed to the floor, out cold.
</p>
<p>
	“Sorry man, must’ve given you the one that don’t work.” He smirked, as Kellan backed away in shock. “Oh, there’s my David Bowie knife!” He said, reaching down to pull it from the kid’s neck. As it passed Kellan’s face, she saw the initials J.G scratched on the handle.
</p>
<p>
	The radio squawked, and Florgo’s voice came through in a panic, the sounds of clattering and crashing clear on the other side of the transmission. “Guys, you gotta get back here, something’s up with the Chief!” As Kellan tried to grab the radio from Hallgrim, Gooch hit her with the gun too, and things went dark for Kellan.
</p>
<p>
	“Wow, it must be my lucky day!” Gooch smiled, brandishing his knife and pistol. “Jim Gooch Clementine, at your service.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t like leaving them.” Asher admitted as they raced back to the station in Crawford’s car. 
</p>
<p>
	“Your friend was pretty clear the Chief is implicated in all this” Crawford hated to admit it, he always thought the chief was a good man, if a little blunt. “The others can take care of themselves. They’ll probably be heading back in Gooch’s car soon.”
</p>
<p>
	I hope so, thought Asher as they sped towards the station.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Kellan woke, tied at the chest to a tree in Poe Creek, colder than a particularly snooty polar bear with far right voting tendencies. Gooch was laying out black tarp on the forest floor, presumably for her and Hallgrim. She tried to wiggle free, but it was no good, she didn’t have the strength.
</p>
<p>
	“No use, girlie. Cold saps the strength. Might as well just accept it.” Gooch said matter-of-factly.
</p>
<p>
	“Why are you killing these people?” Kellan said quietly, her head still aching from being knocked out.
</p>
<p>
	“I know what you’re thinking. He be a sex pervert, killing kids and sticking his bits in the holes he pokes.” Gooch turned, smiling with a mouth full of disjointed teeth as he approached her with his knife outstretched. “But ah ain't that far gone. I was selling drugs from the evidence locker to those no hopers, and they threatened to snitch on me. Ah can’t have someone threaten my job, police pensions are ridiculously good and I get to hit, maim and steal with impunity, a sociopath couldn’t get a better job.”
</p>
<p>
	“That’s it?” Kellan asked. “You killed a bunch of teenagers because they threatened you? Why didn’t you just threaten them back? They probably would’ve backed down.”
</p>
<p>
	Gooch looked confused, sucking in air then blowing it out again. “Well ah…ah mean to say that…they…shut up, that’s why! God in heaven, why do all you punk kids think you’re smarter than me?”
</p>
<p>
	“Maybe because you have your deputy badge on upside down.” She said.
</p>
<p>
	As Gooch looked down at his chest, Kellan lifted her knees into his face sending him flying back to the mud. She took the chance to try and open a Rift under him, but her head pounded, and all she managed to do was open a portal roughly the size of a small coin beneath him before almost passing out. 
</p>
<p>
	Gooch got up to his feet and spat teeth into his hand. “My budilingus teeth!” He bellowed before approaching Kellan with the knife. “I’m going to enjoy this.”
</p>
<p>
	Then she realised, she didn’t have to open a big portal. She concentrated and then relaxed, and suddenly Gooch stopped in his tracks. He drooled profusely, his eyes glazing over as if her were drunk, then he fell face forwards into the mud. 
</p>
<p>
	“Tally-ho! Her Majesty’s Bigfeet Brigade are here!” A voice sounded as Oryx and HUM13, along with four ape men, burst through the treeline only to then stand around with nothing to do.
</p>
<p>
	“Guest starring HUM13 and Oryx!” announced HUM13.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx sighed, and went to Kellan to untie her. “We arrived as expeditiously as we could. The Bigfeet needed to prepare their battle cries, then they had a vote, and it turned out to be a contentious issue. I take it that was our killer, whatever did you do to him?”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan pushed the ropes off and hugged Oryx in thanks. “I realised a small portal could do just as much damage as a big one in the right area, so I Rifted a section of his brain about fifty miles north.”
</p>
<p>
	“God bless us, every one!” HUM13 announced carrying Hallgrim.
</p>
<p>
	It was a few hours before Crawford brought Asher and Florgo back from the precinct, and to his credit, Crawford only screamed and pointed his gun and accidentally firing it at the sight of the four Bigfeet, which marked him as one of the greatest policemen that ever lived.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan had been explaining that the likelihood of the Bigfeet being caught if they stayed together was four times as likely, but the men were adamant they stay together. As she sent them to a more remote part of the United States, they all exited with choruses of “Cheerio and Ta-Ta!”
</p>
<p>
	Crawford brought Asher to one side and kept his voice low. “I assume you have to go?”
</p>
<p>
	“Yes, w..we have other places, other timelines to visit.” Asher kept her eyes down, not wanting to look him in the face. “How will you explain this?”
</p>
<p>
	He smirked. “Aneurysm? His prints are over the knife and the cut patterns are from that knife clearly. Might be in line for a promotion thanks to you guys.”
</p>
<p>
	Asher kissed him on the cheek. “You’re better at this than you think, Brett Crawford. Keep helping people, the police need more men like you.”
</p>
<p>
	“You ever come back to this timeline, you look me up, you hear?” Crawford said as a Kellan opened a Rift behind them.
</p>
<p>
	Asher nodded, and walked over to her sister, a tear in her eye. 
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim nudged Florgo. “Whatever happened with the police chief?”
</p>
<p>
	“I though he was suspicious. He had the gait, the forehead, the hair and general demeanour of a viscous cryptid. He was angry and sweaty, furious at my existence and threatened to kill me at any point.” Forgo shrugged. “Turns out he was just a usual Policeman.”
</p>
<p>
	They all walked through the portal and Kellan closed it slowly behind them.
</p>
<p>
	“God bless us every one!” HUM13 shouted. Oryx sighed again.
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
