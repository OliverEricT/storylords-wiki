	The violet sun was dipping its sweet shaft below the horizon - did I mention that in this reality Earth had a dick-shaped sun…what do you mean this is the first sentence of the season and how could you possibly know that? Well I dunno, do some fucking research dweebuses! Professor James James watched as the sunset illuminated all the bare ass rump, dick, and titties on display at his summer condo pool party sexstravaganza. There was more flesh on display in his garden than a discount butcher’s window in Texas on Superbowl weekend. A familiar hand slapped him on the bare arse, it was his business associate, wife, and no-pants dance partner, Professor Susan ‘Big Suze’ Campbell.
</p>
<p>
	“How we looking, James?” She stood naked, holding a tray of powders gathered from the finest systems: Graxan Gut Buster, Tenebrian Titty Twister, Sherbert - and I know what you’re thinking, “Oh, the Brit is using a euphemism for cocaine”, but no, this was actual sugary sherbert - Blackhole Buttdust, cigars, and nose sherbert - alright, this one was cocaine. James sighed, life was good, some might argue too good for two nerdlinger scientists. Well it was… for another two minutes maybe, before their endless machinations in this reality would destroy Earth. But they would be long gone by then.
</p>
<p>
	James sat on the tray to take a delivery of Blackhole Buttdust straight in the rear door, then put an arm around Big Suze, grabbing a handful full of silicone enhanced titty as he did. “90 seconds to no return for this loser reality, Suze, and these little inventions of ours are our ticket to a brand new Earth to pillage and manipulate.” He waved his hand to show the metal bracelet that they had built together so long ago.
</p>
<p>
	“How many times have we done this now? I forget. It’s a side effect of the anti-aging tech I developed.” Suze downed her 15th double liver-killer drink of the evening as she looked out over the orgy of naked flesh writhing in front of her. “How many cycles of cheating the system?”
</p>
<p>
	“Eight, and with each new reality we get more coin and more ass. Next time around, we’ll be in all the deepest coin purses, financial and flesh. We could be gods maybe.”
</p>
<p>
	Big Suze pulled the timer out, five seconds. They spent the last seconds of existence just swapping spit, before the earthquakes started, and giant tectonic volcanoes appeared on the horizon, spewing black smoke and magma into the air. The air-brained models surrounding them got out their phones to record the devastation, desperate for one last set of likes before they would all be burned to crisps by the impending lava tsunami.
</p>
<p>
	James took Suze’s hand and pressed a button on her wristband. A violent, shimmering rift in space opened in front of them. And they could hear birdsong on the other side. “Shall we, Professor Campbell?”
</p>
<p>
	“But of course, Professor Kendall.” 
</p>
<p>
	They walked through, arm in arm, as the world descended into screams and death behind them.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Kellan ‘Rook’ Amray sat cross-legged on the floor and drew four lines of characters in the air with her hologlove, each illuminating in a lurid green. “Can you tell me which of these is a compound sentence?”
</p>
<p>
	The teen looked at her lazily, with the sort of slack-eyed contempt that simultaneously made you thankful you weren’t a parent or the sort that would sock a child in the jaw. 
</p>
<p>
	Kellan sighed. “This attitude makes me wanna compound this lesson up your butt.” 
</p>
<p>
	Desi was one of the Feldar, the nomadic races of the Veil, but despite what the propaganda said, she wasn’t simpleminded and she didn’t survive on a diet of sandrats and daytime television. Kellan had been teaching the Feldar women how to read, a skill reserved for the Highborn, for nearly a year now. Whenever she could take the shuttle from the station, she made sure to spend some time with the encampment. 
</p>
<p>
	There were many reasons why Kellan shouldn’t have done this - A) Unionised Planets citizens were forbidden to cross into the Veil without permission, and should have stayed on the border of the Ilima territories; B) teaching Feldar to read was punishable by painful and extremely final death, probably involving pokers and orifices, and; C) she had been asked not to do anything stupid on her assignment by her superior. 
</p>
<p>
	But the powers that be hadn’t counted on the fact that - A) Kellan didn’t agree with this Highborn crap; B) The Reap were cool as penguin shit - they didn’t put down roots or feel the need to comply. It’s not as if they were anything like the Reap;  C) she was born stupid ; and D) her superior was a fucking narc who could suck her dick. This sort of reasoning was but one of the reasons Kellan found herself banished to deep space assignment away from her home.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan sighed and drew two balls and a veiny shaft that Throb Loinpound, the famous smutsmith would have been proud of, in the air. “Do you know what this is?”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re so funny, human.” Desi giggled into her hand. “Why do you try and teach us the Highborn ways?”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan half-smiled. “You remind me of someone I used to know, and you deserve better than to be scapegoated for the woes of the universe. I’ve gotta go, promise me you’ll work on the sentences, ok?”
</p>
<p>
	After Desi nodded, Kellan picked up her bag and the clicker she always carried with her on the off chance and exited the tent. She was surprised to find the Feldar hurriedly packing up their campsite, families rushed with bags to their hovering domiciliary units, children clutched toys, or pets. Giant horseflies - not the horseflies we know, but horses with wings because this is a Sci-Fi setting (Note to self, should I have called these Pegasuses to avoid confusion? Oh well, too late now - Lords don’t delete!) were being latched to the mobile caravans to move the farming and domiciliary equipment. Elder Greypubes (names were often literal amongst the Feldar, Desi had told her) was directing the evacuation, staff of leadership in his hand. Kellan ran to him.
</p>
<p>
	“What’s happening, why are you all leaving?”
</p>
<p>
	He seemed unsurprised to see her, but slightly disappointed by her presence. “Child, as much as it warms my Boomer, lead and asbestos poisoned heart to see you helping our children, you shouldn’t be here. We heard on the voicewaves that one of the Pillars will be touching down at a settlement south of the Mountains about two hours from here. We are moving on now. I am in no rush for my people to be decimated by the Pillars of Ilima over some imagined sleight.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan almost didn’t want to ask, but she had to. “Do you know which Pillar is coming?” 
</p>
<p>
	Elder Greypubes gave her a serious look. “The Wrath.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan’s eyes widened. This was all she needed, being caught on the other side of the border by her boss, Ms Uptight Dickface herself. The Wrath was one of the eight Pillars of Ilima, chief strategist and warmaster. Like all the other Pillars, The Wrath was installed by the ruler of Ilima (which was often known by its nickname, ‘Brokepeace’), picked from representatives of all the rival empires to enforce the law after the treaty was signed and the galactic war ended. Where the peace was brokered. The Wrath was the grouchiest and most permanently angry one, as if she had taken a restraining order out against orgasms.
</p>
<p>
	“Get your people to safety, Elder Greypubes.” Kellan patted the man on the back. “I’ll try and delay her.”
</p>
<p>
	“Greypubes?! My name is Tony, you rude child!” The man stormed off in a huff, muttering to himself. Kellan turned to find Desi laughing into her hand, and was just about to go congratulate her when the wavebox went off at her hip, and a familiar austere, contemptuous tone came through.
</p>
<p>
	“Rook? Your location please?” 
</p>
<p>
	Wrath’s disdain annoyed her, and she didn’t care if she knew it. “Hey! You know I hate that name, Wrath.”
</p>
<p>
	A bored sigh came back over the wavebox. “Are you on the watchstation? Are you behaving?”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan rolled her eyes. “Yeah, I’m sitting here, doing puzzles, playing the oboe, imagining a world without you in it. Certainly not doing anything resembling breaking the rules at all.”
</p>
<p>
	“I want you to meet me planetside. I need your help with a mission.” Wrath said flatly. 
</p>
<p>
	Kellan panicked, Wrath would straight up skin her and use the skin to polish her guns if she found out Kellan wasn’t on the station, or worse give her a long patronising talk about duty. “Sure, I can leave now. What are the coordinates?”
</p>
<p>
	“43555 by 23994. On a ridge overlooking an abandoned building about seven klicks from your current position in that Feldar caravan.” Wrath said cheerily, clearly pleased with her deception. “Don’t lie to me again, Rook, and don’t do anything until I’m there.”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath cut the comms, and if Kellan hadn't emptied her bladder before her lesson, she would be in the town centre of piss pants city by now. For Wrath to come all the way out here, there had to be something wrong, and Kellan could think of two main contenders, either there was a chastity conference going on, or the Reap were here.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	The trek to the rendezvous was uneventful - avoiding the blistering sun, dodging the mean  giant scorpions with guns that wandered the wastelands, and trying to think up a suitable excuse to explain why she was planetside. What would Wrath understand? Clearly not that she was here to be compassionate, or to see a potential willing hookup, or to have any fun or joy of any kind. If she came clean, she would erase a year of hard probation and ruin her chances of going home again, and that was not acceptable. Another year without friends, without casual drug use, without anything but Wrath’s disapproving looks, snippy comments, and occasional checks on her welfare where she talked about daring strategies she had developed in the most bland way possible. It was like listening to Droopy describing sex acts.
</p>
<p>
	When she arrived at the ridge, she saw the old abandoned facility, with a faded sign in the ancient tongue that read ‘Original Ray’s Pizza, No Seriously, We Were The First. What? Wanna fight about it?’. There were still the old propaganda posters of happy smiling colonising faces plastered on the building, promising advances in medicine, society, and the chances to be happy and successful so long as you didn’t mind selling your soul for nine hours a day to capitalism in exchange for leadership of the planet. Those promises hadn’t exactly been true (except the soul crushing of capitalism, that’s always true), and this world had been a valuable target for the Union, the Velit, and the Norngaard. The planet had swapped hands more times than your moms number at a truckstop.
</p>
<p>
	But now, an uncomfortable quietness filled the air, like the one you have to sit in when your kid asks if their picture is good when it’s literally the worst thing you’ve ever seen and you once saw a dead meth head who had choked to death on his own vomit, and then you smile and nod and put it up on the fridge and try not to look at it because he drew three lines on a page and told you it was ‘our family’ or something sickly like that.
</p>
<p>
	“You managed to follow an order. Your mother would be very proud.” The voice came from behind her, and The Wrath was walking up the ridge, in full armour and armed to the teeth, her bear helm covering her face. No one ever saw the faces of the Pillars after they were chosen, to avoid questions of impartiality. Wrath could have been from Velit, or Norn, as equally as she could have been human. She was built like a tank, with slim toned biceps that could have torn a dozen phonebooks, or a Conservative wasp away from their perceived sexuality. She carried her trusty rifle - Callus - and her giant warhammer - Doomcock - on her back.
</p>
<p>
	“If the General were proud, she wouldn’t have sent me to the arse-end of galaxy, to this one horsehead nebula town.” Kellan smirked as she pulled out her farseers and threw them to Wrath.
</p>
<p>
	If Wrath got the joke, she didn’t acknowledge it, just caught the farseers and brought them to her face in one emotionless motion. “You know why you’re here, Rook. Let’s not have this discussion again.” 
</p>
<p>
	A flash of a child falling into nothingness danced in Kellan’s memories, but she quickly banished it. Before Kellan could argue, Wrath went on. “Got the call from General Amray that a dipshit Princess had been kidnapped and brought here after a diplomatic mission in The Veil.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan stood in shock. “Wait, you mean the Feldar are going to be offered a chance to join the Union?”
</p>
<p>
	“Get down!” Wrath pounced into Kellan like a Boomer on a Facebook comment section about trans people as a laser blast flew over Kellan’s head. Wrath rose onto a knee, pulling a knife from a holster at her belt and threw it in the direction of the blast. 
</p>
<p>
	“Aw fuck.” Came an anguished cry. “Now Jerran will have to reset ‘days without injury’ board!”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath and Kellan followed dying grunts to a man who had a long blade sticking from his gut. He was leaking profusely, but still tried to reach the dropped laser rifle that was just out of reach. Wrath stood on the rifle, and the man gave up, clutching his wound. The assassin wore a bandana of skins to hide his eyes. Folk tales told that the Reap were insane savages who cut into their flesh, and most of them hid their faces to prevent infection to their wounds, not to mention being fuck ugly, like Rocky Dennis had got busy with a piece of 60 grit sandpaper. He turned to look at Kellan, saw the Unionised Planet symbol on her uniform, and seethed, almost frothing at the mouth at her. “Filthy Union pig.” he spat.
</p>
<p>
	“You tried to shoot me!” Kellan stammered, simultaneously horrified and psyched that she was important enough for someone to attempt to kill her. “My friend here is going to shove a warhammer up your peehole!”
</p>
<p>
	“I’ll do no such thing.” Wrath reached into her pack and pulled a first aid kit from inside, and retrieved two small pills, one orange, one blue. “Listen, Reap, the blue one should stop the bleeding unless we hit something major. The orange is for the pain until your people can get here to stabilise you. You can have them, so long as you tell me where we can find what we’re looking for.”
</p>
<p>
	“Fourth floor. Western corner. We not…planning to hurt her…” The Reap soldier was breathing hard.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan shook her head. “Yeah, right. You scum were probably either going to fuck her, kill her, or eat her. Probably not in that order!”
</p>
<p>
	“Rook.” Wrath pulled a pistol from her pack. “Take this, secure the perimeter and see if you can find any entry points on the outside of the building. Don’t go in without me.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan took the pistol with trembling hands, Wrath trusted her? This was news to her, she always thought Wrath hated her guts even when she was a kid. “Sure…I…thanks Wrath, I don’t know what…”
</p>
<p>
	“Just focus, and watch your corners. You’ll do great. I’ll be along soon.” Wrath shooed her on, then watched the girl move down the ridge until she was out of sight. She turned to the Reap soldier. “Now, please, tell me where the thing you’re really hiding is.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Kellan made it to the building without shitting her pants in fear, which in her head was one in the win column. What was she thinking? She was so pleased to prove herself to that dweeb Wrath, that she hadn’t thought about the immense danger she now found herself in. She’d been told all the stories about the Reap, crazy maniacs who showed all the decorum of a glob of jizz in a glass of chardonnay. Old enough not to believe everything she heard, she knew that most of what was said about the terrorists of the Veil was hyperbole, that they just wanted to take from the three galactic powers. But seeing the man there, so angry at her for merely existing, made her hate them all the more. They could be helping the peoples of the Veil, like the Feldar, using their stolen resources to provide for them, but instead they wanted to just cause chaos and disruption to others. They wanted what the Union, Norn, and Velit had.
</p>
<p>
	She rounded the building to find an old rusty stairwell that went up to the fourth floor, probably to mitigate the fools from jumping to their deaths as they realised they were wasting their lives chasing coin. Suddenly, Kellan heard a high pitched scream from inside the building, someone - probably the princess - was being tortured in there. With a cursory look around, she couldn’t see hide nor helm of Wrath, and gulping her fear down, she climbed the stairs to the fourth floor, pistol shaking in her hand.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	“You see, Babbit. I heard if you take good, and you take bad. And then you take both, then you have the facts of life.” The gigantic Reap guard who smelled vaguely of dung explained to his diminutive colleague, who was scratching her head.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan squeezed between two of the boxes that littered the top floor and edged closer to the two. It was strange, there were no other Reap here, and these two didn’t even have weapons. It all seemed just a little too easy.
</p>
<p>
	“Where you hear that?” The smaller guard said in her thick Feldar accent which sounded vaguely like whatever accent Rich felt like doing.
</p>
<p>
	“From gods on other side.” Giganto said. “They were singing to me.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan stopped. They couldn’t possibly mean…there couldn’t have been a Rift here? Reflexively she reached for the Clicker, but caught herself in time. She couldn’t risk making any noise and being found out.
</p>
<p>
	“They sang to you? You so lucky.” Smallganto said.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, will you please shut up, you morons!” An annoyed, masculine-sounding voice came from behind them, and Kellan stood on tiptoes to see a person robed in Velitaen Ambassadors garb. He was tied to a chair and looked as if he had been forced to endure these people for far too long, Kellan was an excellent judge of body language. “I have been forced to endure you people for far too long.”
</p>
<p>
	You see, I told you she was a good judge of body language.
</p>
<p>
	“You are rude one, sir.” Giganto said. “You only have to stay little while, until gods stop speaking.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan checked her pistol, set it to stun. She wasn’t about to start killing people, especially two people who seemed as if they would be more comfortable with a reading of The Very Hungry Sand Scorpion than a kidnapping ring. She popped up from the box and stunned the big guy, who instantly fell into a heap on the floor, peacefully sucking his thumb as he settled. The woman with him roared with laughter before Kellan stunned her too.
</p>
<p>
	With the room clear, Kellan walked out to the Velitean, who rolled his eyes as he spotted her.
</p>
<p>
	“At last.” The man sighed impatiently. “Wait, who in the great sphincter of the galaxy are you? Where is Wrath?”
</p>
<p>
	‘She’s here. Sent me to rescue you. I thought you were being tortured, Princess.” Kellan said as she reached for the ties around the chair.
</p>
<p>
	“Chance would be a fine thing, might have made this mission more interesting. The screams were the frustration of two days with these idiots. But I found the rift, it’s ready to be closed.” Kellan stopped untying him instantly. “Wait, why have you stopped? Untie me this instant!”
</p>
<p>
	“Quiet down there, Princess.” Kellan flipped on the clicker, and it started sounding instantly, as quick as she’d ever heard it. 
</p>
<p>
	The Velitaen sighed. “Wrath giving me that codename is the worst part of this mission, believe me. Why have you got a radiation detector…unless. Wrath didn’t send you did she?” The young man started to panic. “Wrath! Wrath get in here!”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan stunned the annoying man, his head slumping forward. “Sweet dreams, your majesty.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Kellan took the stairs down to the third floor sub basement, wishing all the while that she had done more cardio on her assignment, then opened the door marked ‘Parking Garage’ in the old tongue. She didn’t know what it meant, but unless it said, ‘painful butt cancer straight ahead’ then there wasn’t anything in the galaxy that could have stopped her.
</p>
<p>
	The room - beset here and there by stone pillars that stretched from floor to ceiling, and burnt out horseless carriages that couldn’t even hover - was painted an ethereal pink that shimmered and reflected off the surfaces. In the corner of the room, like an orifice of doom - which is what an unkind ex-girlfriend once called her before Kellan headbutted her - shone a pink, fizzing circle. As she got closer, Kellan could hear whispers emanating from the portal. 
</p>
<p>
	“Who is that?” She was just about to lean further in when she heard a small voice. 
</p>
<p>
	“Kellan. Kellan it’s me, can you hear me?”
</p>
<p>
	That memory danced in her head again, of reaching and grasping for her sister, of a child’s fingers slipping through hers. Of a rift closing too soon. It couldn’t be, Kellan had been looking for a year now, it couldn’t be as easy as the first rift she found, could it? 
</p>
<p>
	“Ashr? Ashr, is that you?”
</p>
<p>
	“Help me, Kellan. It’s cold here.” Her sister’s voice, clear as day and somehow louder, came spilling from the rift. “You have to free me.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan couldn’t help it, though the clicker at her waist was now almost a constant hum, she reached her hand forward to help her sister. When Kellan’s fingers breached the surface, it was ice cold, dead even. And then something reached out in return and grabbed her by the wrist. long bony fingers that couldn’t have been Ashr’s wove around her arm, until they plaited and became like rope, pulling her forearm towards the rift. Kellan tried to scream, but couldn’t utter a sound, as if the very life was being sucked from her.
</p>
<p>
	She pulled, but with dead arms that had no strength, and weakened legs that found no purchase. As the demon hand pulled Kellan towards the surface of the rift, all she could think of was what hell she might’ve accidentally consigned her poor baby sister to.
</p>
<p>
	From nowhere, Doomcock came down and crushed the demonic wrist under its heft, making it instantly release Kellan. It recoiled in shock and retreated back to the rift. The floor rushed to meet Kellan as she fell, and Wrath brought a device from her belt that shot a signal towards the rift.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan screamed at her not to close it, but it was too late, and as the rift shrank and blipped away, Ashr’s screams seemed to get louder. Kellan stood and drew her pistol squarely at Wrath’s head. “Open it again, Wrath.”
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t be silly, Rook.” Wrath put Doomcock on the floor. “That wasn’t her.”
</p>
<p>
	“You heard it too?”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath nodded.
</p>
<p>
	Tears flooded Kellan’s eyes. “How do you know it wasn’t her? Ashr fell into a rift just like that. I could have saved her this time. I could have rescued her.”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath turned around, placing a hand on the pistol and forcing it down to the ground. “No, she’s gone.. But if you don’t believe me, here.” She passed the device to Kellan. “Just press the button and open that thing again.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan stared up at the woman who had served her parents for as long as she had been alive. The Wrath was many things, but she wouldn’t lie about something like this, would she? She dropped the device, and then stamped on it until it was in pieces.
</p>
<p>
	“That was a sensitive and expensive piece of equipment, Kellan, you just had to hand it bac…” She was winded as Kellan rushed and buried her face into Wrath’s armour.
</p>
<p>
	“Does anything good ever come out of those rifts?” Kellan whispered as Wrath put her arms around the teenager.
</p>
<p>
	Wrath stared down at the girl. “Sometimes, Rook. Sometimes.” 
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	The trek back to Wrath’s ship, Gloombreaker, was long, but most of it was spent in silence on Wrath and Kellan’s part. They said nothing as they traversed the wasteland. Princess stood further back from them muttering to himself about the indignity of it all and the lack of decent coffee facilities on the nuclear wasteland planet.
</p>
<p>
	When they got to the ship, the Velitaen headed inside without so much as a goodbye. And Kellan turned and started walking back to town and her own shuttle.
</p>
<p>
	“Where the hell do you think you’re going, Rook?” Wrath called.
</p>
<p>
	“Back to the station. Got the rest of my house arrest to serve for carelessly killing my kin, remember?” Kellan shouted over her shoulder, before stopping, realising there was something she didn’t understand. “Why’d you lie to me about why we were there? Why the deception?”
</p>
<p>
	“A test. I had to see if you had the stones to stand up and do what needed to be done.” Wrath smiled. “And you did. The general wants you to come home, work with me. What’d you think?”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m not the orders following type, Wrath.” Kellan said, shock taking over. “If we had yearbooks, it would’ve said ‘most likely to be a colossal, annoying prick to everyone that knows me’.”
</p>
<p>
	“You’ll be in good company then.” Wrath held out a hand. “You want to help me right the wrongs of the universe?”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan took the hand and walked into the shuttle as the ramp began to close. “What wrongs?”
</p>
<p>
	“Have you ever heard of James Corden?” Wrath said.
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
