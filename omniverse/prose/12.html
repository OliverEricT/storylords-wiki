	E12 - The Nightmare Council

	Prompts - Dreams and Countdowns
</p>
<p>
	Hallie Swiftfeather pushed the low hanging branch aside to step into the Gladecleft’s ceremonial clearing, but no one was there to greet her. There were no council chairs, usually reserved for the leaders of the six Elven kingdoms - Wood, Dark, High, Space, Science, and that random sect of Elves that always turned up buck ass nude to proceedings. Hallie thought that maybe they should be the real Wood Elves, but instead they were just called Funky Elves.
</p>
<p>
	Instead of the thrones, stood a single, dark tree. It wasn’t a tree she was familiar with, the branches black and gnarled, though very much alive. In fact, more than alive. It seemed to be pulsing. No. It was breathing. She walked up to it with measured, trepidacious footsteps, not blinking until she was a foot from the tree. She reached a hand out to the trunk, and gasped at what she saw, it was small and pudgy, the hand of a child. A child that touched their father’s laptop without washing their hands first and don’t they know how much that costs, Evan? (Achem) Looking down, she saw her waif smock that she wore as an apprentice, when she was only ten years old.
</p>
<p>
	Once the initial surprise was gone, she noticed that the ‘trunk’ of this obsidian tree was nothing but knotted and wound cabling, a tree made of machinery and wire. Suddenly filled with a desperation for it to be gone, Hallie pulled at the thick cables, tearing chunks of it away from the mass. She did this until she felt a heat on her back, and turned to see there was no forest around her, only the burned and smouldering remnants of her home, lighting the sky in an orange hue. Even the Dankpit Dwarves that had slaughtered her clan knew not to disturb the trees, but someone - something - had burned every tree to stump and root: a heinous sin to an Elf.
</p>
<p>
	Hands hit steel, and her attention was drawn back to the structure in front of her. Probing with her fingers, she felt the edges of a metallic frame, and pulled it out of the tangle. It was a screen, displaying nothing but static. And in the white noise she suddenly heard a whisper.
</p>
<p>
	“There you are.”
</p>
<p>
	Two steel, skeletal, clawed hands burst from the screen to grab her around the throat.  Try as she might, she couldn’t fight, the cold creeping into her and paralysing all thought and feeling. The hands squeezed, and as the light faded from Hallie’s sight, she heard the ringing of a bell in the distance.
</p>
<p>
	*****
</p>
<p>
	“Come back, General.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallie opened her eyes to find herself cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by candles. There was something there, a recollection of something, but she couldn’t grasp it. She reached back and felt a pain at her throat, then further, to remember her golem aided destruction of the Dankpit Brewery, then further back to some questionable music tastes in college and an even more questionable taste in men. Including that guy who said ‘supposably’ She stopped trying with an exhalation, whatever it was, the vision had gone.
</p>
<p>
	“It is not common to be able to recall a reading, General Swiftfeather. “That’s why we exist, to scribe what prophecies we can to these tablets.” Omniseer Mookie sat in front of her on the carpet, slightly twitchy around so many open flames, at least that’s what Hallie hoped it was. Mookie hadn’t changed a bit in the ten years since Hallie had first visited the Mothman Prophesiers to get a reading to find out how she could destroy the Dankpits. They were still cute as a button, antennae constantly twitching, but there was a confidence about them now, a power emanating from them Hallie could almost reach out and touch.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m having these dreams every night. Nightmares really, I can’t remember them all too well, but I wake in pain and unease.” Hallie wiped her sweating forehead. “Could you see anything?”
</p>
<p>
	“The future is hard to see...” Father Flicker, the luminous green moth who acted as the Omniseer’s chief advisor began, but the Omniseer held up a hand to silence him.
</p>
<p>
	“No. We don’t keep truth from people any longer, Father. No obfuscations, no riddles.” The moth said, then offered Hallie a tilt of their head. “It’s not good, General. An evil rises in the North, on the site of your destroyed home.”
</p>
<p>
	“Is this connected to the message you asked Doots to give me, Omniseer? About this Technomancer?”
</p>
<p>
	“Please, call me Mookie. To say I’m not used to the Omniseer title is an…understatement.” Mookie looked slightly embarrassed. Hallie knew the feeling well, to obtain a role and fill the expectations of the role were two very different things.
</p>
<p>
	“Only if you call me Hallie. The whole General thing may have the menfolk finally listening to me, but it makes me feel a little old.”
</p>
<p>
	“Deal.” Mookie held out a leg, which Hallie took in both of hers eagerly. Once the gesture was finished, the smiles vanished and Hallie and her new friend remembered what they were doing here. “The Mothman Prophesiers have serviced others with these sorts of dreams and visions recently. The old doctrine was to hide them, to hope that the futures read would not come to pass. I believe that is cowardly. it has already cost me friends and family.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallie was shocked by the admission, to hear the keeper of all the Ithea’s secrets so honest, so open, she had to wonder what that would mean in terms of Data Protection (Rich, is this a good joke? Is this how far you’ve fallen? Patreon.com/brosb4prose before the office life claims me for good.) “If we need to go investigate this Technomancer, I’d rather it be kept between the people who already know about this.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie stirred in her seat uncomfortably. “Yes. About that…we need to talk.”
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	Doots sharpened the axe edge of her Keytar while she waited in the Great Hall and watched her fellows that had been summoned. They were a motley crew, and not in the shitty band, sex-tape having way, but the badass group of killers and mercs way.. In one corner, far from everyone else, Human Doots knew as the Ranger Ria Grey snored heavy as she sat in a chair with her robotic eyes swivelling in their sockets, watching the rest of them even as she dozed. On another table a bright orange Jeleskeleman with neon Green bones floating in her body sat playing a drinking game with a Swamper Frogman with a large hexagonal, spiked cudgel. The game seemed to be who could drink the fastest, the loser would then have to down a drink, and the winner…also seemed to celebrate by downing a drink. She wondered if the two friends would would welcome her pointing out that what they were doing wasn’t a game, and didn’t want to spoil their fun.  On the other side of the room, silently watching the rest of the party was someone she hadn’t initially seen - the Darkling, Taber. He was slim and lithe, a shadow made sentient, his entire skin an inky, oily black.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly Doots realised she was doing something she always did when she was nervous. Her glowing fingers rubbed against the carved message on the back of the Keytar, a message of friendship that she still couldn’t understand.
</p>
<p>
	“The Technomancer comes. Tell General Swiftfeather to ready for war. Love, your friend.”
</p>
<p>
	The message was accompanied by a carving of a moth, a carving she assumed was from the kid at the Mothman Propheciers that was so nice to her. The guilt at being unable to remember made her burn white hot. What the hell was wrong with her? She was so lost, so damaged, that she couldn’t even remember someone who had been kind to her. It made her feel so sick. Doots pulled her knee up and started playing a calming tune that filled the room, it instantly made her feel a little better, the stings of guilt fading with every note.
</p>
<p>
	“You play so beautifully.” Taber was at her elbow suddenly, his inky voice smoother than Marvin Gaye covered in honey flavoured lube “I have never felt so calm. How do you do this?”
</p>
<p>
	“I just…use the strings to find the sympathetic frequencies needed to produce the effect needed.” Doots shrugged, she’d never really thought of the how of it before. “It’s just maths, really. There are frequencies to make people sick, or slow, or to turn people into wild rabid animals…those are usually football songs.”
</p>
<p>
	Everyone in the room now surrounded her, so entranced by her playing that they had stopped what they were doing and were entirely fixated on her. The Frogman smiled serenely as he linked arms with the Jeleskeleman, both of them swaying together or maybe holding each other up due to all the drinking.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s beautiful isn’t it, Bar’Thur?” The Jeleskeleman said.
</p>
<p>
	“Like being back in the spawn, Blotch.” The Frogman responded.
</p>
<p>
	Doots found herself marvelling at the fact they could all understand each other, the universal translator devices they had embedded behind their ears really were a Science Elf work of wonder. There would be no ‘Speak friend and enter’ style mess ups on this quest!
</p>
<p>
	“God, it’s sappier than an Ent’s nutsack in here.” Grey muttered in disgust. “I was in the middle of hunting the worst of vermin, Republican, anti-union, werewolf cops (ARAUWCAB). I want to know why the hell we’ve been called to the Capital.”
</p>
<p>
	“I think I can help you with that Ria Grey.” A voice at the end of the hall declared.
</p>
<p>
	Doots knew who it was instantly and lowered her face in shame. At the grand double doors to the hall, stood Omniseer Mookie, flanked by General Swiftfeather,
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	Mookie took a deep breath and looked round at the group, not happy about their first public address and the direction it might take. She rubbed her front legs together and  “When the Mothman Propheseers came together under the first Omniseer, the decision was made to preserve and control the flow of information in certain regards. It was thought that by protecting people from knowledge about a possible future, we could offer a guiding hand back to a more positive viewpoint. Like if we see someone might mix stripes and checks in a shirt/tie combo, we might keep that knowledge from them in the hope they might avoid such a faux-pas.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie snorted a laugh, but when no one so much as smiled - mainly because people wore mail, jerkins, and capes in this universe and no one knew what they were talking about - they went on. “The problem was, we then started controlling everything we interpreted as threatening, the bad decisions, bad omens. Everything from a beating to a genocide, we avoided. We contained and deleted, forgetting that sometimes good decisions can lead to catastrophe too.”
</p>
<p>
	“How did you contain and delete them?” Doots sneered. And Mookie saw a fury on her that they had never seen.
</p>
<p>
	“The Propheseers recorded and wiped the memories of anyone who displayed visions of armageddon, genocide, war.” Hallie said, with a look of sorrow. She had to have been wondering if one of the Mothmen had inadvertently helped the Dankpit Dwarves kill her kin.
</p>
<p>
	Taber steepled his fingers in front of his face and just watched them all. He was a creepy looking, inky spot that somehow was there and not there at the same time, reflective and absorbent. Looking at him was like looking into a deep despair that no one could escape. The opposite of light, it was no surprised she was suspicious of him.
</p>
<p>
	“Wait.” The Jelleskele called Blotch stood straight, her slime changing to a deep red. “That time I came to the Propheseers and woke up in an apothecarist’s tent three months later? Was that you guys?”
</p>
<p>
	“No, you gelatinous idiot, that was my cousin Hel’Ep’s wedding. You drank the clan mage’s entire potion bag and nearly died.” Bar’Thur erupted into laughter and Blotch joined him.
</p>
<p>
	Mookie cut through their revelry. “We took something from all of you at some point. Some of you more than once.” Mookie couldn’t avoid Doots’ glare.
</p>
<p>
	“I find this incredibly redundant. If it was in service of the realm, then what does it matter?” Ria Grey shrugged, not caring about any of it and checking her dual crossbow pistols.
</p>
<p>
	“Nothing I suppose,” Hallie nodded. “Unless you’ve been dreaming of the metal skulled fiend I have.”
</p>
<p>
	They stood in silence, a shock descending on each of them. Looks of understanding passed between them, each one remembering the face of the Technomancer as if a sudden recalled dream.
</p>
<p>
	“He’s real?” Bar’Thur shuddered, gripping the menacing cudgel tighter.
</p>
<p>
	“I dreamed I watched him slaughter my kin.” Blotch muttered. “ All of them split front of me!”
</p>
<p>
	Doots stood and strode towards Mookie with such menace that Hallie blocked her. “How many times? How many times did you butchers take my memories?” as Hallie ordered her to stand down, Doots crumpled to the floor and sobbed.
</p>
<p>
	“By my count, over 200 times.” Mookie got up and placed a leg on their friend’s head, feeling tears in their eyes. “I’m so sorry, Doots.”
</p>
<p>
	Walking to her arms chest in the hall, Hallie pulled her longsword, ‘The Fucker-Upper’ and her shield, ‘Steve’ from the locker and strapped them on. She turned to the rest of them and smirked. “How about we all go kill us a nightmare?”
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	Bar’Thur hopped up a rockface jump by jump until he was at the top, then swivelled his eyes frontwards to look out over the forest of glade cleft a small swampish land in the middle of the forest. General Swiftfeather and the Moth (who he thought they’d brought along as a packed lunch) had said this was where the Technomancer would be waiting. It had been a week long trip back to the glade of the Wood Elves, far from the true boggy lands he hailed from, as hot and humid as a post sex butt crack in the height of a heat wave, he wanted to cave this metal bastard’s face in with his cudgel.
</p>
<p>
	“What’d you see, wart-face?” Blotch called up to him.
</p>
<p>
	Bar’Thur smiled, his throat pouch expanding as he chuckled to himself. “Your momma’s phone number on every tree, asking for some sweet frog action.”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch laughed, picking up a stone and throwing it at him. “You can’t fuck a Jeleskele, we’d burn your little toad-chode directly off your body.”
</p>
<p>
	“Your momma would be worth it.” He laughed, watching his friend range ahead.
</p>
<p>
	Taber slithered out of Bar’Thur’s shadow and put a finger to his lips. “Perhaps you should worry less about your bravado and more on the matter at hand. I don’t want to killed because you two can’t resolve your sexual tension.”
</p>
<p>
	Bar’Thur grabbed the Darkling by the neck and threw him to the ground, then placed the club at his chest. “Worry less about me, dark thing, and more about how easy it would be to crush you to black dust.”
</p>
<p>
	In a flash, Taber shrank back into the shady side of the club and forced it into Bar’Thur’s face. “Don’t test me, you sweaty green monstrosity.” With that he had vanished into the shadows, leaving Bar’Thur to lick his wounded pride.
</p>
<p>
	“What was that about?” Ria Grey perched in a tree high above them, her robotic eyes scanning the trees.
</p>
<p>
	“Darklings and Swampers, been at war for about fifty years now. Taber’s pop and mine met in battle at the mudshores of Grenneth. Killed each other. Blood debt was paid, but not like we be picking out bed linens or anything.”
</p>
<p>
	“Might have something else to fight pretty soon, Swamper.” Ria turned from the trees to look Bar’Thur in the eyes. “You think this thing is real?”
</p>
<p>
	“Six of us having the same thing appear in our dreams?” Bar’Thur ran a tongue over his slimy lips. “Seems likely. Why? What did you dream?”
</p>
<p>
	“A choice I wouldn’t have thought myself capable of.” Ria looked sad, almost distraught. “You?”
</p>
<p>
	The Frogman thought for a second, wondered if he might be revealing a weakness. “Saw myself fall, so’s I did. Something in my back. No dignity, no honour, not dying laying pipe in some sweet clutch of spawn. Just me and the dirt.”
</p>
<p>
	Ria went to say something, but both of them turned in unison as a bright flare went off in the forest. Ria pushed the button behind her ear. “General. You see that?”
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	Doots pushed through the brush as she played ‘Ain’t No Sunshine When She’s Gone’ convincing the plants the sun had gone in and making the leaves part either side of her makeshift path. Mookie followed her, but they had barely spoken the last six days - Doots couldn’t bear to look at her so-called friend.
</p>
<p>
	“Clever.” Mookie whispered.
</p>
<p>
	Doots grunted in response.
</p>
<p>
	Mookie pressed on. “I understand you might not forgive me, but the reason I carved that message on your keytar was to let you know the truth.”
</p>
<p>
	“Secret messages don’t really cut it with an amnesiac that has been mind violated hundreds of times.”
</p>
<p>
	“I didn’t know, Doots. I promise I didn’t know.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots stopped, but didn’t turn. “And yet you went along with it?”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie’s voice was quiet, ashamed. “We fought this thing. Together. And it killed the closest thing I had to family.” Mookie wiped a tear from their eye. “I was confused, I was scared. I did what I was told to do.”
</p>
<p>
	“You were wrong.” Doots said between her clenched teeth.
</p>
<p>
	“I…I was. I freely admit it. But I came back. For you. To tell you the truth. I could have hid it but I didn’t.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots spun, so angry she was crying now. “That doesn’t erase what you did!”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie looked crestfallen. “I know.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots tucked her chin into her chest. She wanted to shout at Mookie, to be angry with them, but she just couldn’t. Mookie was trying to put things right because they cared about her. Most dismissed her as a lunatic, or crackpot. But. Mookie’s people did this to her. An emptiness filled Doots’ belly.  “Mooks, do you honestly see a future where we’re friends again?”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie smiled, their antennae twitching. “I don’t need to, I have something better than visions. I have hope.”
</p>
<p>
	As Mookie held a leg out, Doots hesitated, before the two of them were assailed by a white light.
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	Hallie rushed to the light-burned clearing to find the rest of them waiting for her, surrounding a…metal man lying in a crater. The sounds of buzzing and birdsong, surrounding them.
</p>
<p>
	Mookie and Doots stood behind him, and the rest of them to either side. Ria Grey activated her bitchin’ cloak cloak and turned invisible.
</p>
<p>
	Before anyone could do anything else, the metallic man sat upright, looking around but not truly seeing them.
</p>
<p>
	“What is it?” Bar’Thur asked, his throat pouch swelling in defence.
</p>
<p>
	The robot turned to Bar’Thur, then Blotch. He was so odd, curious like a child, smiling innocently. Ria Appeared in a flash of blue brandished a pair of repeating crossbows at him, her knuckles white as she gripped the guns. He barely even registered and instead stood up, and it made Hallie furious. What if this was a trick? She raised ‘The Fucker Upper” and tried to sound mean, though she sounded like something out of those high fantasy soap operas on the television that got all the details wrong. Talking toad men…absolute rubbish.
</p>
<p>
	“Speak soft, stranger. You are either lost, or an agent of our prey.”
</p>
<p>
	The metal man registered no threat, no danger whatsoever. “I do not know where I am. What country is this?” Heath took a step forward.
</p>
<p>
	Quick as a flash, Doots pulled her axe up from behind him and rested it under his chin. “I dunno, General Swiftfeather, this one looks mighty shiny to me.”
</p>
<p>
	The intruder recoiled at the voice, his eyes wide.
</p>
<p>
	“Calm down, Doots.” Mookie put a leg to Doot’s shoulder. “This isn’t the time for anger. Hallie needs us ready for anything.”
</p>
<p>
	The thing turned quickly and held Doots in a long embrace which shocked everyone, Doots Bardsly most of all. “Doots? I thought you’d died!”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie looked uncomfortable, looking down at their lower legs, before they noticed the man was holding something. Mookie snatched it from his hand and turned away. A rustling was heard as the Omniseer smoothed out a piece of paper and stared at it in disbelief, then showed Doots.
</p>
<p>
	“Where did you get this?” Doots demanded, pushing him away from her.
</p>
<p>
	The metal man looked confused. “You gave it to me, before you pushed me through that portal.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots flipped her keytar to show him the message scratched there, the one she had shown Hallie, the message that had bound them all to this quest. It matched the one on the scrap of paper Mookie held. Hallie gave Bar’Thur the signal.
</p>
<p>
	“I can explain.” the robotic man muttered.
</p>
<p>
	Bar’Thur brought the back of the cudgel down on the man’s head, knocking him out. All of them stood in shock as the stranger fell to the floor unconscious.
</p>
<p>
	“What now?” Ria asked.
</p>
<p>
	All eyes flitted to Hallie, before they followed her gaze and turned to Doots and Mookie.
</p>
<p>
	The pair looked uncomfortable, desperate even. Mookie shuffled nervously. “I suppose we should tie him up, continue to our objective?”
</p>
<p>
	Hallie nodded. This was becoming more and more confounding by the minute.
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	Taber slithered back to the camp after five minutes, and nudged Hallie awake. She had slept for five minutes and the small rest she had gotten made her feel like she had gone ten rounds with a bottle of Bert Butts Hurt Guts magical ale - fourteen vomits or your money and stomach lining back. Hallie noticed that Taber was keen to avoid Doots. Made sense, shadows couldn’t live so close to the light.
</p>
<p>
	“General Swiftfeather. I found something.”
</p>
<p>
	They all entered the clearing together - Blotch carrying the metal stranger over her broad jelly shoulder - but Hallie felt as if she were truly alone. The black tree stood in the clearing as it had in her nightmare, as menacing as it was then.
</p>
<p>
	She took steps towards it again, unable to hear the words of discouragement from her fellows.
</p>
<p>
	In the middle of the trunk of cables a metal monitor sat, and red numbers counted down. 00:03, then 2, then 1.
</p>
<p>
	The explosions, even as far off as they were, rung loud in their ears. But the sound came after the piercing light that blinded, and the gusts of wind that threatened to pull the trees from the ground. When the cacophony was over, Hallie climbed the tree as no other in the party could, eager to get to high ground.
</p>
<p>
	The major cities of Ithea, the white lands, the swamps, the dominion of men, the stone city of dwarves, the veil of shadows…all were ablaze, as they were in Hallie Swiftfeather’s dream.
</p>
<p>
	And miles away, the creature that once was Timmy Blackcrest and the A.I. Eden smiled.
</p>
<p>
	TO BE CONTINUED…
