	Prompts: Junkyards and Bodybuilders

</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim awoke with a start in a dank pit of darkness only rivalled by…wait have I done this joke about your mother’s dank baby maker already? If I haven’t, then Josh or Jeff definitely have. Man we really go hard on your mother’s, don’t we? Which coincidentally is what those four guys at the bus station that she picked up on a lonely Tuesday said about her. Hallgrim winced at the pain in his chest, and moved a hand to it in the dark, but a hand was already there, a cold flannel tending to his bruised flesh. “That better be you Ash, I’m a one woman man now.” He murmured.
</p>
<p>
	“Lucky me, eh?” She whispered. “You should rest, we have to move soon.”
</p>
<p>
	But he was awake, and sat up gingerly. “Feels like I got hit in the chest with a giant metal mace.” He mumbled.
</p>
<p>
	“You did.” She said. “Keep your voice down.”
</p>
<p>
	“A mace in the chest, I’m hoping we were attacked and this isn’t a new kink I asked you to try out.” He muttered, his sleep delirium IQ just higher than room temperature. “Where are we?”
</p>
<p>
	“Same place we’ve been the last ten months.” Asher sighed and kissed his forehead, no use in getting annoyed with him. “We dodged a Bloodpack patrol, but we were ambushed by the Sandfoxes. Barely got away with the clothes on our back.”
</p>
<p>
	“As long as I kept what’s under them.” His joke was met with silence, and he heard the rustling as she forced their meagre belongings into the backpack. Ash put an arm under his and helped him to his feet, before she walked him in a shuffle to the mouth of the cave. He suddenly felt the warmth of the morning sun on his face, but realised all he could see was darkness. His hands grasped for Asher in a panic, and he brushed against the bump at her belly.
</p>
<p>
	“Ash, what…?”
</p>
<p>
	She could barely hide the frustration in her voice. “For the third time in twenty four hours, I’m pregnant, your cybernetic parts are half destroyed, you’re blind, your short term memory isn’t backing up because you’re so damaged, and we’ve been stranded in some godforsaken wasteland for nearly a year now. Oh and you lost your entire 14 omnibyte drive of pornography because you devoted any leftover space to essential memories. Welcome to the end of the world, my love.” 
</p>
<p>
	His mouth dried out, the news almost too much to take. “Even the Dixie Buttkiss films from her peak era when she was performing with PP Burns?”
</p>
<p>
	She clipped him around the head, but found herself laughing. “Please tell me that is fake.”
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, it’s fake, her real peak stuff was with Drew P Schlong.” He smirked, but it was short lived. “How long have I been…”
</p>
<p>
	“Like a shitty Alzheimers’ Blade Runner? About three months.”
</p>
<p>
	He’d missed so much, they were in danger, with no way to escape, and she was doing it all alone. And she was pregnant! She needed him, and the thought of being a burden to her was too much. Hallgrim activated his scanners and turned on the spot. Though he couldn’t see, the large deposits of metal from two miles away was a stronger pull than the pull in his shorts from a Dixie Buttkiss double feature. “We need to get me repaired, before I get the two…three of us killed. Or worse, we all might forget about porn.”
</p>
<p>
	“Let’s hope this is the baby’s first memory.” Asher sighed.
</p>
<p>

<p>
	“Chunder! Chunder! Chunder!” The Sandfoxes chanted as their leopard-print leotard clad bruiser of a leader deadlifted two bodies he had turned from living into not so living with his pythons. I mean, he just stuck them in headlocks and just squeezed them until their brains dribbled out of their ears like the last bit of toothpaste in the tube. For any MAGAs out there, toothpaste is what people use to clean those things in your mouth you open shitty Bud Light bottles with. This podcast is NOT sponsored by Bud Light, the beer equivalent of the muddy shit-ridden puddle a man dying from thirst wouldn’t drink from.
</p>
<p>
	When he put the barbell down from his last set the crowd around him went crazier than white girls during pumpkin spice and casual racism season, and a lackey came at him with a towel, along with others who were desperate for their leader to show them any sort of attention.
</p>
<p>
	“Chunder, if you ever need help moving, just shout and I'll come running!” One said.
</p>
<p>
	“Chunder, I’ll clean your whole cave, free of charge!” Said another. “Home cave or bottom cave.”
</p>
<p>
	One man came running up to him and grabbed Chunder’s manly forearm, his eyes big like saucers. A single tear dropped down his cheek and ran down his smile channelled face. “Please do me the honour of having relations with my wife Chunder, she does it wasteland style!”
</p>
<p>
	“Gentlemen, gentlemen!” The burly bodybuilder said. “I’m flattered at your attention as always, but I’ve told you, you don’t have to treat me any differently than this sterling chap here.” He slapped the back of a small boy and broke fourteen ribs in his small body. As he went off to cough himself to death, Chunder walked the crowd of men and women in tattered Edwardian wear, in his grey waistcoat barely containing his mammoth pecs. “Also, I’ve told you, my name is Lord Charles H Underwood. I’m the same man I was when we came here. A little older, a little wiser, but it’s still me. I appreciate you standing with me, though the other tribes call me psychotically mad from the heat of the twin suns and possibly my aristocratic inbreeding, but I swear by the imaginary pigeons that are gradually eating my face I’m as sane as the next blue blood.” He wafted his hand in front of his face at nothing. Get away foul harpies! We have to stick together, show strength. It is not the other tribes that mean to kill us, not the Bloodpack, or the Reap, but our own weaknesses, our own shortcomings.”
</p>
<p>
	A troop of giant lizard-riding Sandfoxes came screeching to a halt by the crowd and dismounted. Their leader, a strong woman in engineer overalls, came running to her leader. “Lord Chunder!’ She said breathlessly. “My Lord, we found them - the metallic man and the assassin. They are traversing the shiftsands.”
</p>
<p>
	Chunder put down the feathered quill he was using to sign his autographs, and looked to the horizon, where he knew the shiftsands would be. He pulled a pair of spectacles from his front pocket and put them on his nose. Though the glass had been smashed years ago and they made no difference whatsoever, he swore he could see better. “The vortexes will take care of them, but let’s mount up and make sure! Stable boy, my horse!” He called.
</p>
<p>
	A teenage girl ran to him in tears, holding the reins to his steed. “My brother Calum the stableboy is dead, sir, fourteen broken ribs punctured his lungs.”
</p>
<p>
	“Pssssh.” Chunder exhaled. “You see? Weakness! We must show our strength, and today, we shall! And you girl, you shall come with us as my new page. What is your name?”
</p>
<p>
	“Shelly.” The girl muttered. “But sir, I have tasks to take care of…my brother’s funeral for one.”
</p>
<p>
	“Nonsense, that can wait! The body isn’t going to die more, is it?” Chunder laughed before taking the reins of his beloved. “My beautiful horse, Esmerelda. Named for my mother, you see. She is as handsome as she, as faithful as she, as strong…” He brought a small paper ticket out of his pocket and rubbed it between his fingers.
</p>
<p>
	The crowd stared as Chunder burst into sudden tears, burying his head in her neck and stroking what was not actually a horse, but a giant native lizard. It flicked its tongue at the air, and the lizard shared a look with Shelly and mouthed ‘help me’. Chunder pulled himself together and brought a carrot from his pocket, putting his palm to the lizard’s mouth. The lizard tried to move away, grimacing at the vegetable, but Chunder forced it into its mouth. The lizard stared straight ahead, sick of his shit, bits of carrot in each cheek. “Good girl.” Chunder said as he patted the lizard’s scaly neck. As Chunder mounted him and pulled Shelly up behind him, the lizard spat out the carrot and shook his head.
</p>
<p>
	“To the shiftsands! To hideous revenge! To the inevitable loss of another Page! Ho Esmerelda!” Chunder announced, riding off as his mounted division followed.
</p>
<p>
	“What?” Shelly said, as her voice was drowned out by the galloping of lizard feet.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	It was hotter than a camel’s dick (I meant temperature, but if anyone has a kink for camel dick, then you’re welcome I guess??) on the shiftsands, and Asher could feel her strength sapping faster than those three debilitating strokes sapped Kevin Sorbo’s strength and his rightwing cuntburger attitude sapped his career prospects, keep working on that fourth stroke, Jerkules, you fucking prick. “Are you sure this is the way, Hallgrim? I’m not sure you’re entirely reliable at the moment, my love.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’ve got this, Ash.” Hallgrim could feel the intention slipping, and didn’t want to admit it. He knew that he was searching for metal, but for what reason, he wasn’t sure. He had looked back at Ash a few times during their journey and had realised she was pregnant as if it were the first time again, filled with the same odd mix of fear and joy that all would be parents feel. “We’re not far away, few minutes maybe.”
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly his sensors started beeping loudly, and he immediately lost track of his train of thought. Asher came bounding up to him, hugging him tight. “You did it! You did it!” 
</p>
<p>
	She was so proud of him, but he just looked at her vaguely, almost afraid to ask what he had done to make her proud. Asher pulled him closer, his grip on her so tight it was as if he was trying to keep the fear locked up. “It’s ok.” She whispered. “We’re going to be ok.”
</p>
<p>
	The ground beneath them suddenly jolted to one side, and the two of them found themselves suddenly sinking into the sand below. “You’re just a terrible burden, you know that?” She laughed as she kissed his head and the two of them sank into the vortex opening below them.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Asher walked between the rows upon rows of metal garbage, trying to stay on her feet as the subterranean mobile junkyard they found themselves in writhed through the sand. “This really is incredible. You are like underground Sanford and Son of shit.” 
</p>
<p>
	The small old woman pushed her thick goggles up and looked over her shoulder. “Hmhumhumhhum. I don’t get your reference child. Come, come over here and look at this.” She poked at Hallgrim’s body on the table in front of her with a drill, taking off various parts and leaving his mangled fleshy and metal frame exposed. She reached her hands inside and rummaged around.
</p>
<p>
	“Hmmmmm, what do we have here? Pneumatic penis, hydraulic joints, water cooled internal system…oooooh 90% of your body’s internal organ space is taken up by a drive that has interstellar government grade antivirus protection.” The old crone laughed. “You must’ve had the best kinky shit in there!”
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim nodded. “My family kept Limewire in business for decades.”
</p>
<p>
	“Can you fix him?” Asher pleaded, her hands resting on her small bump.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m afraid it’s too late for me to do anything for him.” She sighed.
</p>
<p>
	Asher’s hand went to her mouth. “Oh no.”
</p>
<p>
	“I have a really early start and I must go to bed early.” Crone said. “But he is no longer with us.”
</p>
<p>
	“What?!” Asher moved forward and touched Hallgrim.
</p>
<p>
	“Yes, he stopped paying attention to us.”
</p>
<p>
	“So you can fix me? Whatever it is that’s wrong with me I mean.” Hallgrim asked.
</p>
<p>
	The crone waved her hands in front of her. “Oh no! Definitely not! No chance in hell! He is beyond saving.” 
</p>
<p>
	Asher and Hallgrim stared at her.
</p>
<p>
	“With these items.” She shook her head. “BUT, there is a piece of machinery that could help. An item the Sandfoxes stole from me three years ago. Lord Chunder wears the piece around his neck, and he’s on his way here to kill you both. If you want my help, you will kill him first and take it.” The crone smiled.
</p>
<p>
	“I can’t just take it from him? I mean Chunder has dogged us for months. I’d happily kill him for what he’s done to us, I’m just trying to be better.” Asher looked at the prostrate body of Hallgrim, who stared up at her.
</p>
<p>
	“Ash,” He whispered. “Why are we here? Can we go home now?”
</p>
<p>
	Asher smiled and put a hand to his cheek. “Sleep my love, we’ll be home soon.” She turned to the crone. “Forget it, I don’t care. I’ll kill anyone you want me to. Just help him.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Chunder camped on the high ridge over the shiftsands and kneeled down next to Shelly, who he had made carry all his belongings in a backpack that was four sizes too big for her and outweighed her by two to one. Inside the bag were all his essentials. His rock collection, a dog lead even though he didn’t have a dog, one of those backpacks with a bubble so that you can take your cat outside, a watering can, and his second rock collection. “Binoculars.” He muttered.
</p>
<p>
	With a sigh, Shelly reached into thebag, past the skeleton of a small child that sat at the top, and brought out nothing. She then put her hands into two circles and put them in front of Lord Chunder’s eyes.
</p>
<p>
	“Zoom.” He said.
</p>
<p>
	She turned her hands, and he looked up at her. “It doesn’t work unless you make the noise.”
</p>
<p>
	“Zzzzzmmmmm, zzzzzzzmmmm.” Shelly made a noise like ED-209 powering up.
</p>
<p>
	Chunder studied the horizon with a squint, then stood. “Too hazy, but thank you Shellbert, or whatever your name is. Sandfoxes!” He turned to his group of marauders, all dressed in makeshift hide armour over Edwardian formal wear. “We know our enemies lie in wait in the shiftsands, our anandoners, our would-be saviours! Now we go into the dreaded wasteland, to hunt and kill them.”
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah!” Shouted the crowd full of voice, their fists in the air.
</p>
<p>
	“Some of our number, nay most of our number will not survive the torment of the vortex ridden lands that lay before us!”
</p>
<p>
	“Y..yeah!” They looked at each other, their fists lowering slightly.
</p>
<p>
	“We will throw body after body against them, until our…well of course yours not mine…corpses pave a way to our quarry. Death after death we will endure, for your Lord, until our revenge is had, and the glory of the sandfoxes is writ long in the sand in entrails and maybe the odd kidney for punctuation!”
</p>
<p>
	“Uh, sir?” Shelly tugged at his shirt sleeve and Chunder turned around to see a cloud of dust where his backup used to be.
</p>
<p>
	Chunder brought the paper ticket out of his waistcoat pocket and rubbed it between his fingers thoughtfully. “No doubt they all are going back to basecamp to get reinforcements and more bodies for the glorious cause. What good fellows they are, eh Shelly?” Chunder smirked, and Shelly saw a madness in his eyes. “Still, we can make a reconnaissance can’t we, my page? No threat of death when you’re with me, you’ll be perfectly safe like all my pages.”
</p>
<p>
	Shelly stood and took a deep long breath out in a sigh. “I guess, sir. By the way do you know you have a full child’s skeleton in your backpack?”
</p>
<p>
	Chunder laughed a hearty laugh as they started the descent down the cliff edge. “Yes, yes, that’s my former page, Timothy. Perfectly safe he is. Perfectly safe.”
</p>
<p>
	From an outcropping twenty metres away, Asher watched as the two descended the cliff. The hulk of a man looked intimidating, like he would break her in two. She hung from a rock, knife in her teeth. A knife she would plunge into Chunder’s space where his heart should be or die trying.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim could feel himself slipping, there were names of friends, of loved ones, that were on the periphery of his memory like mist. He yearned for that post nut clarity, so that he could make out the edges. He sat up, and realised he didn’t recognise his surroundings. It was a junkyard, old lamps, wrought iron, and art sat on racks and racks of old garbage. He moved to the wall, where a chunk of riveted iron stood. It was red and soot stained.
</p>
<p>
	“My grandmother built this place out of the wreckage.” Crone said. “She had a shit eye for men, but a good eye for design. Made this sand mole for us to live in and didn’t look back.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim was startled by the woman. “Who are you love? Please don’t tell me I got blind drunk at a dark bar again?”
</p>
<p>
	“Trying to decide whether or not you two deserve killing or saving. Seems like you’ve been through as much as we have since we parted ways all those years ago.” The Crone mumbled and brought a small metal plaque down from a low shelf. She gave it to Hallgrim, who turned it over in his hands. It was brass, with the words HMS TITANIC embossed upon it, with some names. Hallgrim knew he should recognise it, but he just couldn’t remember.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m sorry, I don’t…” He panicked, and at the sight of his confused face, Crone put a hand to his cheek. 
</p>
<p>
	“Shhhh. It’s ok, dear. I’ll help you. You and your friends left us here on this colony after our ship sank. Centuries passed, and it became apparent humans need creature comforts, like food and a natural water supply, and the absence of large arachnids that steal your kids.” Crone smiled. “Everyone remembers the ‘saviours’ of the Titanic. We all despise you. We broke into tribes, fought each other to near extinction. And now the two of you are back and we could have our fun with you. But seeing you like this would be like killing a puppy.”
</p>
<p>
	Crone went to her toolbox and brought out some tool that Hallgrim didn’t recognise. “That better not be a sex toy, my pegging days are long over mate.”
</p>
<p>
	“I sent the woman out to fight Chunder. She won’t stand a chance. I sent her to her death in revenge. Now I think I was too hasty.” She opened up Hallgrim’s panel at the back of his head and hesitated. “If I fix this, it’ll bring you back to your former self, but you’ll have a drastically reduced lifespan. The more you fight, the less that’ll be. Want me to go on?”
</p>
<p>
	“Ash dies, I ain’t got much to live for anyway.” He whispered. “Supercharge me, Grandma!”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Chunder held Asher’s arm up and struck her around the face with the back of his hand. “A woman, a mere slip of a woman. Is that what the Abandoners send me to fight? I am a child of Titanic! My heart will go on!” He screamed.
</p>
<p>
	Asher brought a small dagger from her boot and shoved it into his thigh. With a grunt of fury he threw her to one side, then flexed his thigh muscle until the blade forced itself back out again.
</p>
<p>
	“Your heart, but not that shrivelled weenie you call a penis.” Asher smirked. “What’s the matter Chunder, steroids make your peepee soft?”
</p>
<p>
	Chunder laughed and turned to Shelly. “She thinks sex is more important than revenge, Shelly. We were born and raised in this crucible, moulded by it’s hatred. I would rip off my own penis and use it to choke you with if it meant you and your friends would die, wouldn’t I Shelly?”
</p>
<p>
	“He’s that nutso, alright.” Shelly admitted then stopped when she noticed Asher’s bump. “Sir, she’s with child!”
</p>
<p>
	Chunder smirked, then rooted inside his bag for a weapon. Unable to part with his two rock collections he tore the femurs off Timothy’s skeleton and snapped them to make two bone daggers, letting the other halves drop to the floor. “Good. More of them to kill.”
</p>
<p>
	Shelly didn’t really understand what drove her to do it, she had heard tales as a young girl of the Abandoners who had ripped them from their world of plenty and deposited them here to this armpit of a world. She had every reason to hate them, but for whatever reason…whether she was tired of hate, or she was feeling the grace of god’s light, or that she had seen her brother die by this moron giving his internal organs a high five, she picked up the halves of the bone shards, and ran at him, stabbing him in the back.
</p>
<p>
	“Et Tu, Shelly?” Chunder sniffed, genuinely sad. “Get her Esmerelda!” He called to his lizard, who just flicked a tongue in the air and shrugged.
</p>
<p>
	“Look man, I take a lot of shit from you, but you enslaved a sentient lizard race just to transport your white ass from one patch of desert to the other man. Have you heard of walking?” The lizard said in the exact voice of Chris Tucker which I won’t do for obvious reasons, then took the saddle off and waddled away. “Goddamn hot blooded bitch.”
</p>
<p>
	Asher charged, but Chunder was too fast and too strong. He was the apex of all skills, like when you’re a kid and you design a top trumps or factfiles type thing and you give your favourite character that you made up all the best stats because you love them so much. Yeah he was like Duke Robokarate all over again. Trademark Richmasters Top Trumps Duke Robokarate, DO NOT STEAL (OGOC reference for Jeff there). Anyway Chunder was like that. He had everything but charisma (or Rizz as the braincell challenged are calling it these days), and dick size turned up to 10. He was fast, he was strong…I’m going to abandon this paragraph because I’m tired of saying how alpha he was. He certainly wouldn’t let you copulate with his christian wife while he watched in a chair, that’s for damn sure.
</p>
<p>
	Asher threw small kunai, because apparently she has those too, at him and he simply tensed and batted them away, his forearm muscles just that dense. And those mofos are the toughest to build up, or if you’re like me and lazy, that and EVERY other muscle.
</p>
<p>
	“So pitiful. At least by killing the child I’ll prevent it from ever knowing what a beta cuck it’s mother truly was.” Chunder lifted the bone shivs and thrust them down towards Asher.
</p>
<p>
	A metal arm jutted between them and the bones shattered against it. As Chunder looked up, Hallgrim smirked at the man. “How?” Chunder said.
</p>
<p>
	“Plot contrivance.” Hallgrim said, before he turned his cybernetic fingers into long, thin, daggers and slashed at Chunder’s throat.
</p>
<p>
	“No!” Chunder whispered hoarsely, holding his neck as the blood seeped from the jagged cuts there, before Hallgrim kicked him down the ridge to the shiftsand below. 
</p>
<p>
	“Fucking numpty.” Hallgrim spat.
</p>
<p>
	“How?” Asher whispered. “The Crone?”
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim nodded. Old bat tried to set us up, but had a change of heart. I’m back to my old self, just gotta take care of myself a bit more, ya know?”
</p>
<p>
	Asher sobbed as she hugged him, and he squeezed her back. Then he realised that a small girl had hugged them too, and he gave her a look.
</p>
<p>
	“Sorry, it just looked so nice.” Shelly said.
</p>
<p>
	Asher smiled. “It’s ok. Thank you for your help Shelly, you saved my life.”
</p>
<p>
	Shelly’s feet kicked at the sand. “Can you take me with you, when you Rift away?”
</p>
<p>
	Before they could answer, purple electricity crackled around them, and a tear in the air next to them opened with a blast of air. Asher grabbed Shelly’s hand, seeking to save her from this wasteland world, seeking to mitigate their past mistakes. But she needn't have bothered.
</p>
<p>
	The portal was incoming, and out stepped a woman with a Bear helm, a warhammer and a long rifle. She looked down at the huddled bodies of Hallgrim, Asher and a small girl. She dropped the hammer instantly and dropped down to her knees.
</p>
<p>
	Asher wrapped her arms around her sister, who returned her hug fiercely. “Kellan, it’s so good to see you.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan removed her helm, and let it fall to the floor. “I found you, I found you.” She whispered. 
</p>
<p>
	As Hallgrim looked her over, he noticed that she wasn’t the Kellan they knew, her face cut in a pattern that would form the older Wrath’s scars. “Kellan, how long has it been since you’ve seen us, mate?” He asked.
</p>
<p>
	“Twelve years.” She cried.
</p>
