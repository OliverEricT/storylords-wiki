Episode 8:  The Good, The Bad, and The Funghi 


Prompts: Cowboys and Fungus


By Rich Masters


‘My Dearest Samuel,


Life continues to be hard as a stud’s dick on his wedding night in Wyoming in the year of our Lord 1846, in this mining town called Fiddler’s Bean in which we reside. I know you already know all o’ this, on account of you being my husband and all, but I felt the need to set the narrative scene in case others were to read this missive or create some sort of widely consumed rooting tootingly popular comedy narrative that you could pay five dollars to to become a patron of. 


I hope that your business trip selling your patented “Droopy Dong Tonic” is going well, with enough monies to send little Jessie to the doctor on account o’ her Ratlung from huffing the binding glue from our family bible. She has been coughin up a storm, and to be honest it is getting to be irritatin. 


Old Lady Heywood told me a funny story that she got to thinkin’ she caught a glimpse of you  outside “The Velvet Clam - Liquor in the front, Poker in the rear”, when she went a callin’ on her aunt Ethel in the big city. I said that there was no way on God’s yellow, dusty earth that it could be you, spending our savings on ale and tail when we have debts passed due and with Little Jimmy needing the doctor on account o’ that case of blindness from touching hisself when he thinks Jesus isn’t watching.


On unrelated news, I have spoken with Mr Bill Dollar from the Bank and made a large addition to our insurance policy, because if you’ve gone whoring when Little Fido is in need o’ the dog doctor on account o’ his being run over chasing a Pony Express wagon, I will strike you down with every ounce of pure redhead scorn I can muster.


I be writing for somethin’ different though. It’s been an interesting few weeks in Fiddler’s Bean. You need to come home, now. The mine has done collapsed, and most of the menfolk have done what they been doing all their lives; being drunk, useless and dying. There’s less than five swinging dicks in town now, and for once we be needing ‘em. Some weird noises be coming out of the mine shaft, worse than a cow rustler after five nights of bean surprise…’


“Lily.” A voice interrupted her and she dropped her pen.


Lily grabbed the cumbersome rifle resting at her leg and spun around. “Jesus, Fleb. Don’t be creeping up on a woman like that. I done had two kids, and I got a bladder full of coffee, it only take a horse’s whinny to make me let out a little liquid gold.” She stood to find the town Sheriff, Fleb Bartlesby - a man who won the right to be the elected law official in the town through being bottom in standardised testing and a failure in the pullout contraception method, which is how I imagine police make their appointments to this very day - holding a lantern in her doorway.


“Miss Lily , I know it’s awful late and my face is awful ugly,” Fleb wasn’t exaggerating, he looked like a science experiment, trying to combine an inbred hick with some sort of traffic accident. His protuberant nose looked like a wart on a mule’s ass, and his giant jug handle ears made his head resemble a trophy for the world's loneliest brain cell. “But there’s some hubbub at the saloon, one of the miners has walked into town, and he’s covered in this stuff.”


***


The Bottom of The Barrel Saloon was jam packed, as it always was in this small, podunk township. The six of them sat in the corner of the room to the side of the piano, and while you’d probably think the rest of the saloon goers would have been giving them side-eyed stares and spitting at the sight of them, the other patrons barely paid them any mind. Kellan had told the residents of Fiddler’s Bean they were a travelling circus on holiday from the fair, and these kind hearted and dim brained people had bought it. All apart from Lily Mayweather, the owner of the rundown general store - The High Noon Eleven - who seemed to be the only person with two brain cells to rub together. She was rightly suspicious of all of them, and always held the skinning knife she wore at her waist whenever she was in the same room as one of them.


Five of them sat around the table as Hallgrim played the piano with gusto. Well, what he was actually doing was pretending to play whilst pumping out music through his internal speakers. Tonight was the 1993 seminal classic, Enter The Wu Tang, which the patrons didn’t really understand. Oryx went over and whispered to him and he sighed loudly, before starting to play the plinky plonky bullshit they were accustomed to.


“Well, this place is certainly not cliched in any way.” Said Asher as she sat down and pushed a bottle of brown liquid and five shot glasses towards the centre of the table. The hood of her Reap skins was covered by a wide brimmed hat. “Drink up quick people, we need to be on the move by midnight.”


“Why no glass for HUM13, y’all?” HUM13 protested with raised arms, dressed in a long poncho, Mexican hat and drawn-on curly moustache which had smudged off in places. “Is this because y’all think I’m a robot again?” They had been in this reality for two weeks now, and Hum13 had resolved to use ‘y’all’ wherever possible. “Y’alls are loco. Y’all.”


Florgo pushed his shot glass towards HUM13 with a smile. “You can have mine, HUM13, I’m not much of a drinker. I'm more a hard drug user.” He said the last bit under his breath.


HUM13 huffed, folding his arms across his chest. “Well I don’t want any now.”


Oryx was standing at the piano, morose, until Hallgrim gave him a nudge. “What’s up with you, purse-puss? You’ve been grumpy for four days now.”


“This subterfuge grows heavy on my soul.” Oryx growled. “To pretend we are travelling circus freaks…it is insulting to my heritage.”


“What’s the alternative?” Hallgrim shrugged. “We have the human crocodile, the lady of knives, the automaton, the metal mannequin, the mystic - which by the way seems slightly racist Florgo, but you suggested it for yourself, so I’m not going to push - and Kellan the big dull dud promoter who is the only one of us that passes in this old Earth mess.”


Kellan sat watching the door, expecting trouble. She had been on edge ever since they had arrived here, and the opening of the portal had temporarily drained her of the strength to open another. They were stuck here until she could muster the energy.


“There’s nothing coming. They’re not following.” Asher said over her drink. “You keep watching that door, you’re going to make something happen.”


“They’ll come, I know it.” Kellan muttered, pushing her drink away; she hadn’t eaten or drank much of anything in days, and the large black bags under her eyes showed it. She wondered if part of the reason she couldn’t open a portal was because she didn’t know what to do next. “The Pillars may not be able to open portals as well as me, but they’ll come. I’m struggling, I don’t know what to do, I needed Wrath to…”


The group fell silent and lowered their eyes. They had talked at length over what their coming here had meant for their old worlds and lives. Though Wrath had told them all that things would be ok, that she would stay and protect everyone, they had heard her death cries as the portal closed and the machines of their enemies tore her apart. Kellan was now the only ‘her’ left, and weirdly, she felt lonely. 


“We can only do our best, I imagine that’s all that she did. We need to stop worrying about predestination and just make the right choices in terms of morality, not destiny. And not eating or drinking isn’t going to do you much good.” Forgo said as he pushed one of the bowls of thick brown chilli (See? Americans like brown food too!) he had ordered from the bar towards her. Forgo had been a revelation to the group and fit in as though he had always been here, keeping their spirits high and their focus on task. He was always so calm and collected, even though they had dragged him here without asking permission. In Kellan’s experience, someone that perfect would reveal himself to secretly be pissing in their shoes whilst they slept, or whispering lovingly to a knife under his bedsheets. She didn’t trust him, and continued to watch him like a hawk.


HUM13 put a hand to Kellan’s shoulder and got uncomfortably close to her, putting his big metal smiling face into hers. “Asher is right, the statistical probability of something else coming for us in this era is 305,477 to…”


The saloon doors burst open and Hallgrim stopped playing. A malformed figure stood silhouetted against the lightning and cliche-filled night sky. 


“305,477.” HUM13 finished sheepishly.

 

The man was covered in mushrooms that protruded from his mouth, eyes, under his fingernails, that tore holes in his dungarees, and filled the deep wounds in his torso and legs. Like seriously, this guy had more fungus on him than your mother after her regular keys in a bowl Christmas potluck party.


“Mah Piano!’” He pointed at Hallgrim and shuffled forward.


“Oh god, it’s Frederick, the piano player.” One woman shouted over the hubbub of the bar.

“Look mate, if you don’t like my music, maybe you could suggest something better. The Monster Mash perhaps?”


Dead Frederick lunged for Hallgrim and grabbed him around the neck, forcing him off the stool to the floor. “You took my life!” he slurred, a mouthful of fungus making the words sound muffled.


“Sorry mate, don’t know it!” Hallgrim lifted his foot and used it to push the man off of him, as Florgo grabbed him and hurled him back towards the door. As soon as he hit the wooden boards, he was getting to his feet again, pointing at the Piano. “I want my life back.”


Fungus started wrapping itself around Hallgrim’s neck,choking him as it tried to move toward his mouth. Florgo pulled the growing mushrooms away with his gauntleted hands then threw them in the fire, where they seemed to scream as they popped.


“Are you ok?” Forgo asked as he helped Hallgrim to his feet.


Hallgrim scoffed. “Choking and forcing things into my mouth? I’ve had rougher first dates mate.”


A blast took Fredericks foot clean off, and he howled in ungodly pain, a howl that was more painful to the ears than having to hear Mariah Cary warble about Christmas for the 145th fucking time in December. Over him, standing in the doorway, Lily Mayweather stood with her rifle smoking at the doorway. Beside her, the town Sheriff, Fleb Bartlesby shook in fear, before jumping on his horse and hightailing it out of town. Lily tutted and shook her head, picking up the sheriff’s badge that was still spinning on the floor. “Stay down Frederick, we ain’t into your particular style of music.”


“Y’all, I think I am in love.” HUM13 said as his eyes rotated in his head. 


Oryx bent down and brushed the zombie’s coat, a thick plume of dust wafting off it. “Question. Why is this man covered in rock dust?”


As a large swell of groaning came from behind her, the customers of the Bottom of The Barrel looked out over Lily’s shoulder. From the collapsed mine on the horizon, an army of dead miners were shambling towards the township. Towards them.


***


As The Women of Fiddler’s Bean boarded up windows and doors hurriedly, and others worked to tie up Fred the Dead so that he couldn’t harm anyone else. Lily crossed the room to point her rifle directly at Kellan. Asher went to the sword at her waist, but Kellan gestured for her to hold on.


“You did this!” Lily Mayweather said, wearing a face that your dad used to reserve for when you didn’t hold the torch straight. Yeah, you know the sort of thing I mean. He asks you to hold the torch, while he works on the engine of the car he’s too cheap to take to a mechanic, and when you’re not holding a light source straight for three fucking hours is the thing that’s stopping him making the repairs, and not his lack of education on the subject. Oh, big surprise Dad, putting your hands on your hips and sighing, then saying “Looks like a big job” isn’t going to fix an engine. But sure, it’s my fault for moving a centimetre with a light. Anyway, she was looking like that.


“What could we have done to precipitate this situation? We’ve been in this questionable establishment playing the dysentery lottery all evening.” Oryx said.


“We didn’t have any weird fungal zombies before you came into this township!” Lily roared.


Asher snorted. “You also didn’t have a single IQ over 80 before we got here. Unless any of those horses out there are Mensa members?”


Kellan held her hands up, trying to channel her mother. Etty was the consummate politician for a General, though her fairness and even temper in wartime hadn’t quite translated to homelife. Kellan didn’t quite have the skillset down pat, but if she just tried to think what her mother would say, it could work. “Lily, we’re not your enemy. That man is one of your people, and they attacked one of mine.”


“Who died and made her the boss?” Hallgrim sulked.


“Literally Wrath, you moron.” Asher hissed.


Kellan sighed. “Whatever is happening here is a result of that collapsed mine, you know it and I know it. If you want, we can help you sort things out. I think that’s why we might be here anyway.” 


Oryx cleared his throat. “Kellan, I’m not sure that…?”


“No Oryx. Wrath wanted everything shrouded in secrecy, and that was her undoing. We need to be honest with people if we want their help.”


Lily Mayweather narrowed her eyes at the young girl in front of her. I mean, they weren’t far off in age; since life expectancy was so low, Lily was 20 going on 44. But Kellan felt younger. “What’re you proposin’?” Lily said.


“I want my wife and my piano!” Fungal Fred wailed, his foot had already started to grow back, and was nearly complete, boot and all. Everyone looked at him, equal mixes of concern and utter disgust on their faces.


“Go. the rest o’ your people can help me defend the town.” Lily said, clearly uncomfortable with the 


“Let us go find what’s bringing these menfolk back to life and save this human domicile like the rooting tooting desperados we are.” HUM13 put his hands on his hips, then looked shocked, like he’d forgotten something. “Y’all.”


***



Kellan, Hallgrim, Florgo and Asher left the back way, because apparently the mushroom zombies were too stupid to swarm around the saloon and just flocked to the front door. Saddling up, they rode in a large circle to avoid the Mushroom Menfolk and headed to the mine.


“Lots of men died in that mine.” Florgo said. “ We have to be careful.”


“Oh thanks, mate. Before you said that I was going to walk in arse backwards and cheeks spread.” Hallgrim was clearly uncomfortable on the horse, bucking around and looking like he was goingto fall.


Kellan whirled around. “Quiet.” She hissed.


Asher gave the others a look, and Florgo shrugged. She rode up to Kellan to find her sister silently weeping. “What is the matter?”


Kellan quickly wiped her face. “I’m so fucking angry, Ash. I don’t know if I can do this. I don’t even know what I’m doing here.”


“When I first met Wrath, she didn’t have a clue what she was doing either. She was a stupid idiot full of emotion and impulse. But she still saved my life, Oryx’s, Hallgrim’s, countless others. You are raw at what you have temporarily lost, I know. Remember, it takes time to temper a sword, but far more time to steel a heart. You’ll get there, one day at a time, you just have to see the good we’re doing.”


“I just hope we are.” Kellan said.


They rode the rest of the way in silence, until they reached the entrance of the mine, which was covered in the fungus. The rocks had been pushed out from the inside, the men digging themselves out of their burial chamber. Hallgrim passed around face masks. “Fungus can go in the lungs to you know?” He said.


Florgo led the way down the tunnel, careful not to touch any of the gross pink tendrils that covered the walls. It was a very Queer Eye for the HR Geiger Guy aesthetic in here. “It’s so cool looking!” He whispered in awe, having never seen anything like it before.


“I find your optimism equal parts charming and throat-slittable.” Asher said as she chopped one of the low hanging tendrils. A low, resonant scream came from the tunnel ahead, and the four of them stared at each other. Hllgrim nudged Florgo. “Go on Captain Ecstatic, there might be something in there to get a joy boner about.”


***


“This isn’t going well!” Oryx howled as he punched through the broken window boarding at a mushroom headed miner. He had a toadstool growing out of his head where his hair should be, which made him look like a hobo version of Toad from Super Mario Brothers. I mean, the guy has an aladdin vibe anyway, with the parachute pants and waistcoat, so maybe he is a hobo, who knows? I digress.


“Metal man, what in the blue ass of hell are you doing over there?” Lily blasted another two miners as they reached through to grab at the women inside, propagating an awful stereotype of white blue collar manual workers and their attitude towards women, but hey, if the mushroom cap fits! 


Hum13 touched his chest, a look of affectation on his face. “She called me human…I er…mean…why wouldn’t she, given my strong virile masculinity.” He held up some random pieces of metal he had fabricated using his internal 3d printer. “Your rifle seems cumbersome and unsuitable to our mushroom harvesting task. I am developing a six chamber rotating pistol to help us defend this building, I should have the first four models ready in approximately ten seconds. I am very good with my human hands, my father was a watchmaking machine.”


“Erm, HUM13, I do not think altering the timeline of warfare would be a demonstrably good idea.” Oryx took his eye off the window, and was swarmed with  mushroom infested hands that pinned him to the boardings. Taking advantage of the situation, an undead Miner reached in to grab one of the women in the saloon as he shouted. “My beloved Samatha!” Before Oryx could reach her, the miner had pulled her through the broken boarding and she had vanished. 


“No!” Lily yelled.


The arms continued to pull Oryx, and his feet raised off the floor. Suddenly, a bullet hit an arm holding Oryx, then another, and another, until all the arms holding him had been severed with some deft shooting.  As Oryx dropped to the floor, he glanced up at HUM13, who had split his arms, General Grievous style, into four separate arms, each holding a pistol. He independently twirled not his guns, but his entire wrists, then arms, then shoulders, then rotated his head 180 degrees. It turns out he didn’t really understand how to twirl a gun. “Fasting operating system in the west!” He declared.


“They took Sam.” Lily said as she took a pistol from HUM13 and started blasting away. “Get these to the other girls, then make more. These mindless beasts aren’t stopping.”


Oryx took Lily’s arm. “I’m not convinced of their mindless status, Mrs Mayweather, listen.”


Lily tilted her head to the sound of what they had assumed was low moaning. There were names in there, the low moaning a dirge of apologetic laments for lost loves. “Come back to me sweetness.” And “Amy Lou, I’m sorry!”


“I’ve never heard so many men apologise before, it’s more unsettling than the undead.” Lily smirked.


***


Forgo moved into a large open cavern fifty percent of his own volition and fifty percent because Hallgrim was pushing him and calling him ‘Cannon Florgger’. The room was covered in the fungus, pink luminescence reflecting off the cavern walls that stretched up as far as he could see. In the tendrils stretching from wall to wall, hung several dead miners, their bodies torn and broken from the original cave in. The corpses were being copied, remade out of some sort of liquid transferred through the transparent tendrils. As Florgo watched, the liquid became hardened and became rough approximations of the broken bodies from the fungal growth. One of the newly cloned miners was lowered to the floor gently by the tendrils, only for him to then gain consciousness and shuffle down the tunnel to the surface. “Mah dearest Jenny.” He moaned.


Hallgrim made a whiplash noise, and Asher clipped him around the head. “Idiot.”


“What is that?” Kellan whispered in awe.


In the centre of the room, in amongst the tendrils and rock, a central mass of fungus pulsed like a heart. It’s rolls of pinkish fleshy fibres undulated and throbbed.


“It looks like a close up photo of Jabba The Hutt’s butthole.” Hallgrim said with disgust. 


Asher stepped forward. “It is the same stuff that has been filling the miners. This fungus. We need a strong pesticide.”


“Well hey there!” said a cheery voice. “ Ah hope you’re not talking ‘bout lil old me?” A face appeared in the mushroom wall, two eyes that seemed to focus on the group, and a mouth that smiled widely, though fibrous growth took the place of teeth. 


“But you’re glad you came along now, eh mate?” Hallgrim nudged Florgo.


“Actually, I didn’t ask t...” Forgo muttered, but was spoken over by Kellan.


“What are you?” Kellan asked.


The fungal entity yawned. “Ahm just your regular fun guy, so to speak. Hahahaha, well I mean I’m an ancient lifeform that has been buried in the earth since the last iceage, and you guys brought me up out of my snooze. Ah do so like sleeping in, but I figured it was high time I got out in the world and said ‘heidi hi’! Name’s Fergus!”


“Kill it, kill it now.” Hallgrim said. “It’s too cheery to live, and anyone who says ‘heidi hi’ it’d be a mercy to put them down.”


Asher drew her sword, but Kellan held her back. “What’s your aim here?”


“Well there’s not mushroom in here, hahahaha, so I want to spread as far and wide as ah can. I’ve got a beautiful spread to show off, I’m body positive.”


Florgo cleared his throat. “What about the people of Earth?” 


“What about ‘em? I’m bringing the dead back and sending them back to yous, ain’t that enough?” Fergus Fungus was getting defensive, the cave walls shaking in response.


“I think what he’s trying to say is that the fungal spreading might be incompatible with human existence.” Kellan explained.


“I don’t see why. I just sent them back and removed some of their more stupid thoughts, like the desire to cheat, or steal or be an idiot man in any way. I love an old romance story, so I filled them with love and sent them on their way to their wives.” The fungus said.


Asher put her sword away. “So they’re not zombies? They’re just…” 


“Supportive, wholesome husbands.” Florgo finished.


Kellan smirked. This was why they were here. In no history of Earth was there any mention of a mushroom race. She was here to organise a ceasefire. “You want to stretch far and wide, right? Well I might have a solution to that.”


“Be quick, sister, we have to get back before the townies kill themselves trying to defend from lovesick men.” Asher announced.


***


Lily blasted two men through the faces, and then hit another with the butt of her six shooter. It was almost wish fulfilment from a life of dealing with these catcalling, harebrained idiots every day.


Oryx stood kneedeep in the fungus creeping through the house, trying to grab the women of the saloon. Hum was printing bullet’s faster than he could process and was buried in a mountain of shellcasings. They were losing fast, their barricades destroyed, their resolve failing, they were going to lose.


“Stop!” yelled a voice from the hubbub, and when Lily turned to locate the source, she saw Samantha, who had been dragged away and seemingly eaten an hour ago, alive and well in the doorway, holding one of the miner-zombie’s hand. “It’s ok, we need to stop fighting.”


Everyone lowered their fabricated guns and the zombies in turn stopped fighting, filing in calmly into the saloon. Lily rushed to the front of the group and grabbed Samantha’s hand. “Girl have you gone full on poobrained? That’s not your husband!”


“But he is mah Emmett!” Samantha said, hugging the miner. “And he’s come back better than ever. He’s spent the last hour apologising for all the terribleness he’s ever done, fixed the fence post he always promised to, and then gave me lots of sexual gratification without expecting anything in return.”


“Alright Sam, he’s a zombie not one of the heavenly horde.” Lily said.


“It’s true, I tells ya.” She looked around the room. “Girls, our men have come back to us the way we always wanted them to. They don’t care about sports, or horses, or gamblin. They just want to be considerate and kind.”


Much to Lily’s disgust, the ladies around her all ran to find their men, forgetting that they were obviously cloned monstrosities of their former selves, and left to travel home. Kellan and the others marched in as the throng moved out, and Lily made a beeline for the young woman.


“What the hell have you done? You were supposed to stop them, not make peace.”


Kellan smiled. “For all intents and purposes, those men are the same as they were before, they’re just made of mushrooms now. And this way, we stopped a hideous eldritch fungus taking over the entire planet.”


Oryx cleared his throat. “How did you solve this?” 


Asher laughed. “The fungus wanted to spread out, so we said he should spread out into the water supply. His effects would be diluted, but over time maybe in about 500 years or so, men might learn to be normal on their own.”


EDITORS NOTE: THEY NEVER DID.


***


The next morning, Lily Mayweather took the travelling freaks to the plains and took their horses back. She looked around at the wild emptiness surrounding them. “Are you sure you want me to leave you here? There’s nothing around for miles.”


“We’ll find our way, don’t worry.” Forgo put his hands together in thanks.


“By the way, we’re going to keep the guns.” Lily said. “With the mine shut down and the men more interested in wooing their wives than work, we’ll need something to produce.” She looked at HUM13, who was trying to twiddle his drawn-on moustache. “I’d like to credit you, stranger. What’s your full name, sir?”


“Some metal cunt.” Hallgrim said under his breath.


Kellan hit him in the stomach as Lily looked confused.


“Sam-uel…Colt.” Said Oryx quickly. “That’s his name.”


Lily tipped her hat to the group. “Well, thank you all. You’ve done us a service today, and I won’t forget it. I was about to finish a letter before you came. I don’t think I’ll bother now, who needs men, eh?”


“Amen sister.” Shouted HUM13, watching the new sheriff of Fiddler’s Bean ride away. As she crested a ridge five minutes later, she looked back to the plains where she had left the band of weirdos, only to see a green tinged circle close quickly in the air, and no sign of the circus freaks.


THE END
