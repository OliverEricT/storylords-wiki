Revenge Is A Dish Best Served Deep

Prompts: Portraits and Breweries

By Rich Masters


Far below Mount Grimrock, in the rare mineral mines where the skankiest dank creatures would never dare to skank a dank, the company of Space Dwarves that made up the Executive board of the Dankpit Dwarves Brewery were meeting for their quarterly meeting. The frosty silence of the summit was only broken by Hamish Reddencrotch as he coughed up the largest lump of dark green phlegm and spat on the table in disgust. The splashback hit his neighbour, Mack McMackintosh, of the Mount McMacklin Mcmackintoshes. But Mack was thick as pig shit and twice as grimy, barely registering as the thick green ooze ran down his coarse black arm hair. He instead lifted a leg and released scotch crack-mist so stomach churning that the Jaxson twins instantly retched brown, ale-laced vomit into their laps. To his credit, Willie Crackensphil sat cross armed and kept his own council, but given his mother was his father’s sister, that particular council chamber hadn’t been in session for some time. Rounding out the group was Sadie WhetFack-Dankpit, who blew her nose on a hanky as transparent as her reasons for marrying the much older, richer, and now conveniently deader previous CEO, Slim Dankpit, then opened it and surveyed the contents, probably scared that some of the IQ she couldn't spare to lose had dripped out.

Outside, Hallie Swiftfeather, waited in reception like a good little summoned Dark Elf, eyeing the portrait on the wall above the Dwarves. The grand oil painting of the recently deceased Slim Dankpit that hung above the long oak table was truly awful. Not in terms of quality, in fact it captured his gross corpulence, sallow skin, and an anger that only age-related erectile dysfunction could produce. 

Wherever she moved, the eyes of the portrait seemed to eye her with hatred. It wasn’t surprising, the Dankpit Dwarves despised elves with a passionate vengeance, and had lain waste to the neighbouring wood elf village of Gladecleft not ten years ago. They had killed every inhabitant: orphans, old people (which you should care about because unlike boomer humans, old wood elves are super rad and don’t vote for their own interests against the entire human race) and Cutesy Cherubface, voted 'Cutest Elf most likely to be mourned heavily if she ever died in a Dwarf related massacre' four years running.

Swiftfeather regarded all the board members with the contempt reserved for sex offenders and those that lick potato chip dust off their fingers, then reach back into the sharing bag. She was of a mind that if you were a double-dust-lick-dipper, you might as well stir her tea with your cock while you were at it. But this set of Dwarves were the most uncouth bunch she had ever had the displeasure of sitting downwind of, and she had been at the marriage of Quelben the Necromancer King and his questionably squelchy, droopy-eyed bride last year. The cheap bastard had resurrected that shitty band Non-Imagined Dragons to play at the reception too. One band member - predictably - played his exposed ribcage. “Skelemen” she thought, “So cliché.”

“Send her in!” Hamish Reddencrotch yelled to his PA in the reception room where Hailie had been waiting.

“The board will see you now.” The waifish Dwarf said with such disdain it sounded as if her beard was choking her.

“Yep,” Hallie said. "Dwarves don’t have doors, I saw and heard.” Remembering seeing those two dwarf interns just going to tavern on each other in the copy-room earlier.  She entered the room to gasps. Which was something she was accustomed to, Hallie was a dark elf, and even by their standards, her indigo skinned beauty had captivated more than woodland animals, if you know what I mean. Y..you DO know what I mean, right? The sex stuff? Yeah, I knew you knew what I meant, you sly wargs.

But they weren’t gasping at her deep purple eyes, or her dimpled chin, or the thighs she could snap a centaur into its component halves with. It was the Jaxson twins who summed it up best: “What the hell is that elf bitch doing here?”

The assembly’s complaints overlapped, and Hallie heard the words ’stupid slut’, ‘inferior being’, and for some reason ‘Haberdashery sausages’ which didn’t really make too much sense, but didn’t offend her half as much as the others, considering she most probably had misheard that one.

Hamish brought the meeting back to order by yelling an obscenity so bad that in the neighbouring mining shaft, two dwarf kids who were playing there straight up exploded in a fountain of Dwarf guts, leaving little Timmy Blackcrest with what would be crippling PTSD and beginning a life fuelled by dwarf hookers and snorting rock salt - but that’s a story for another day, and also maybe never because that sounds super bleak.

“Listen, ye filthy anal prolapses made flesh. I asked Hallie here to help us turn around the brewery’s misfortunes!” Hamish went on to explain that since the death of Slim Dankpit, the once thriving magic brewery - famous for its bestselling "Axe Gash Rash Begone Ale - guaranteed to cure all STIs or your STI’s back.” - was on the verge of bankruptcy.

The shocked members fell silent. Their pride as dented as Mack McMackintosh’s acne-ridden nose.

“Things were so bad I went to one of the insect fortune tellers from the Mothman Prophesiers, crossed her palm with one of those flickery candles they like so much, and asked her to tell me how to save our beloved business. She explained that if we were to restore our fortunes, we should carve our faces into the side of this Mountain and that would bring success raining down on us.”

Reddencrotch went on. “Hallie is the most revered stone carver of ten generations, she’s going to carve us into myth. For a hefty price of course.”

“What about the legendary Flint Fingered Frankie? Where’s he?” Willie Crackensphil, asked.

“The Dwarven potter who was rumoured to have got his long beard caught in his spinning wheel in that freak accident?” Hamish went over to the minibar and poured himself a hard drink from a clay decanter that looked vaguely like a Dwarf skull, with russet-coloured tufts of hair sticking out, then put it down and patted it with a wistful sigh. “Ach, we’ll just never know.”

“So ,we’re trusting an Elf to restore our fortunes, even after what we did to the Wood Elves?” One of the Jaxon twins asked.

Hallie was tired of all this. “I have as much love for Dwarves as I do for dog-shit flavoured toothpaste,” she smiled. “But your beef was with the Wood Elves. Coin is coin in these hard times, and you promised enough that I would never have to wipe my own butt again if I didn’t want to.”

“Spoken like a Dwarf woman.” Nodded Sadie WhetFack-Dankpit.

“I doubt it.” Hallie grinned. “I haven’t got seven orc dicks in my mouth.”

“Watch your tongue, Elf.” Reddencrotch sneered, he and his company already on the way out of the door. “Start sketching your designs and get to work, you have a month to carve your first dwarf.” They left.

In the mine shaft next door, Little Timmy Blackcrest rocked back and forth as he waited for help, his eyes wide, knowing he may never see light again. YOU SEE?! It’s just too bleak.

Five minutes passed, and Hallie grew tired of the silence as she sketched out her designs for the mountain. “Hell’s teeth, painting, speak and we can end this charade.”

The oil paint of Slim Dankpit’s mouth cracked and split, and as the portrait offered its first words, dust puffed out like a grandma’s queef. “You knew…?”

“I know a haunted painting when I see one. I hung one over my bed to freak men out if they get too clingy.” Hallie replied. “The rest of those dwarf bastards killed you, I take it?”

“They poisoned me at my 126th birthday party. To be honest I did think it was a mite strange that they all got me potions as presents, but I thought they were being cheap fucks, and it was better than receiving a book voucher.  But my rage was trapped in the commemorative portrait they had commissioned to cover their guilt. You’re smart, for a Dark Elf.” Slim Dankpit wheezed.

“And you’re an ugly painting, for a Dwarf.” Hallie went back to her works.

“Wait. They promised you riches, Elf.” Dankpit whispered. “I can give you the entire Brewery.”

Hallie lifted her gaze. “Tell me more.”

Still eyes somehow rolled towards the boardroom’s drinks cabinet. “You see the pot?”

“You mean what is clearly Flint Fingered Franky’s skull?”

“Umm, yes.” Answered Dankpit. “It is a powerful tool…Whisper whisper whisper..”

Editors Note. The hushed whispers imply scene change, preferably in the form of a star wipe.

STAR WIPE!


******

28 days later – not the zombie film, but the actual passage of time – Hallie sat on a hanging support on the side of the mountain, carving the hands of her creation.  She had been given total privacy to work on the masterpiece, and the Dwarf-Matrons had created a curtain laced with silver that covered the entire section of the mountain Hallie was working on.

“Too thin.” The pot in her bag muttered.

“Which one?” She sighed.

“Both.”

She turned to the bag. “You can suck both my nuts, Dankpit.” She muttered. “Now if you don’t want to take a trip down this mountain, hush up.”

Two days left, she thought to herself. Smirking at her plan.


******

The big day was here, and Hallie was ready. The whole of the Dwarf brewing company, from Reddencrotch down, were here to revel in their future success. Some, judging by the dark brown vomit stains on their tunics, were just here for the complimentary booze.

She stood at the base of the mountain, beside a rope that would pull the curtain down, listening to the brass band, who were at least playing some decent music like Stagecoach Confessional and Nine Inch Flails. She was tingling with excitement.

The Brewery board had proclaimed that no families or kids could be present at the unveiling, mainly because Tina Tingletits and Dave Danglerod, Dwarf exotic entertainers extraordinaire, had been hired to mingle in the crowd. Good, thought Hallie.

Reddencrotch and the Board were seated on a centre dias, looking every bit the smug gits they were. The Jaxon twins were farting in their hands and blowing in each other’s faces. Reddencrotch rose to talk into a giant metal cone.

“Get ready.” The clay pot muttered in the bag at Hallie’s hip. In agreement, she placed two fingers around the cork stopper.

“Company. It has been many years since the Dankpit Marauders pillaged this mine from the Orc scum who were basically just licking the magical deposits off the walls.” Reddencrotch announced.

Only half listening, the Dwarf wizard Knobliostro refastened his robe tight, guilty at the mention of magical deposits after that whole public indecency debacle.

“Today, we run a magical brewery that makes up half the exports of the Sunstark Mountains. And to commemorate, we have arranged for this…artist…to carve the board’s visages into the mountain for the entire world to know our successes.” He waved a hand towards the Dark Elf. “Hallie…?”

The stopper came out of the bottle easily, and a shrill whistling was heard, before the curtains began to rustle. Suddenly, Slim Dankpit, in the body of a large stone golem, burst through the curtain with an ear-splitting roar and for some reason known only to Hallie, two giant cocks where his hands should be.

Instantly, the front four rows of the crowd died of shock, voiding their bowels and producing a stink that the world had not smelled since that Dragon with the chronic IBS had been vanquished a century ago. Dankpit swung a dick-hand into the dias, reducing the board to a dirty, dick-induced smear.

Hallie watched her stone giant with the soul of a dead dwarf destroy every member of the Dankpit Company and sadly, Tina Tingletits and Dave Danglerod, but honestly their act was obscene. He made pate of them, the efficiency frighteningly satisfying.

Axes, swords, arrows - nothing could even so much as dent the rocky bastard. One set of dwarves quickly rigged up a makeshift trebuchet, aiming at the golem's head and firing. The rock knocked the head clean from Dankpit, but the stone they had fired was a similar size and shape, so when it nested in the empty space between his shoulders, he just went on attacking with a new, featureless head.

In twenty minutes, everyone but Hallie and her stone Dankpit were dead or dying, and Hallie was riding around on Dankpit’s shoulder in a victory lap, when they heard a whimpering under some rubble. No, it wasn’t little Timmy Blackcrest, who had probably starved to death by now, but Reddencrotch, his legs crushed to an indistinguishable mass, like some slug. The Dwarf looked up in fear at his destroyers.

“Why?” Reddencrotch begged.

Hallie wiped her face, her sleeve now covered in indigo paint, revealing natural green tinged skin. She had been at Mirkout Point with her rebellious Dark Elf boyfriend, Brian, when the Dwarves had massacred everyone she knew and loved in the Wood Elf village of Gladecleft. Her anguished cries to the Mothman Prophesiers had made them take pity on her as they chewed small holes in her tunic. They had revealed a possible future, filled with revenge on the Dwarven butchers. All it had taken was ten years of stonework study under the master Gewain ‘The Rock’ Johnson, a few bribes, a decade of obsession. But here, at the end, there was only one answer. 

“This is for the wood elves, you short ass bitch.”

“But I’m 4ft10 inches.” Reddencrotch protested. “And I meant why the giant cock hands?”

“That’s what all Dwarf men say. And it’s so you can get fucked like you fucked my kin.” Hallie smirked, and Dankpit’s stone body crushed him to a pulp with a giant cock-and-balls hand.

And with that, it was done, they were all dead.

“Ah, that was satisfying.” Dankpit bellowed. “The brewery is yours, my child.”

“Nah. I don’t need it. If I wanted to own a skanky shaft, I’d go visit a Dwarf whorehouse.”

She crushed the pot in her hands and let the shards of bone, clay, and beard hair fall to the ground. Flint Fingered Franky laughed a hearty laugh as he ascended to the afterlife, and she could hear the ghostly soundtrack from that film about the ghost who does the ghost pottery to connect with his wife when he becomes a ghost. What was that called again? Oh yeah, 'Anal Pottery Sluts #27'.

Dankpit’s spirit screamed as he was forced out of the stone carving and back into his gild-framed prison.

“Now rain their success on them, my most beautiful creation.” Hallie said and flicked the mid stride stone golem in the centre of the chest on the sweet spot she had specifically carved to shatter on impact, before backflipping into a nearby tree with a Wood Elf’s natural grace.

With a crack like thunder, the stone split in two and began to crumble, raining shards of stone onto the mountainside, which she had weakened significantly in her carving. The shafts inside the mine began to close and Hallie hopped out of the tree to survey her good work. It was done.

She wiped a tear from her eye, turned and left.


THE END? NO WAIT – MID CREDITS SCENE!

Little Timmy Blackcrest emerged from the rubble to watch Hallie Swiftfeather walking away from the destruction of his whole world and spat onto the earth vowing revenge. But unfortunately, a month of dark climbing had weakened him and left him part blind, and he accidentally spat on his shoe.

THE END! FOR REAL NOW!
