	A big word floats across the screen of your mind, three letters telling you when this story is happening, they say NOW
</p>
<p>
	“Where is she?!” Etty Amray burst through the doors of the subterranean hideaway and threw her cloak to one side, onto what she thought was a coat rack but was actually Hum13. The robot looked at it against the metallic sheen of his body, then scoffed and discarded it. Hallgrim gave him a look.
</p>
<p>
	“Pastel shades are more my thing, they bring out the natural rosiness of my complexion.” Hum13 said as the Norn shook his head.
</p>
<p>
	“Isn’t that just rust?” Hallgrim said under his breath.
</p>
<p>
	Wrath stood and intercepted General Amray, holding her by the arms though she struggled against her. Wrath shook Etty by the shoulders to get her attention. “General. Asher is resting after her operation. She’s suffered a lot of internal bleeding, but we think she’ll be ok.”
</p>
<p>
	“I meant Kellan.” Etty smiled at Wrath. Wrath pulled her close and hugged her.
</p>
<p>
	“She’s by her bedside. I tried to talk to her, to explain.” Wrath hung her head. “She won’t leave her sister.”
</p>
<p>
	“This must be hard for you.” Etty smiled, but there was a bitterness to it. “Things are accelerating, aren’t they?”
</p>
<p>
	“More expeditious than Wrath’s primary prognostications.” Oryx growled as he stood next to General Amray. “We’re converging on the terminus point at exponential speed, General.”
</p>
<p>
	“What leather-lips means is that we’re the most aerodynamic turd circling the bowl.” Hallgrim said. 
</p>
<p>
	“Turds are a human excretion that I also have.” Hum13 offered, before playing a compressed version of ‘The More You Know’ jingle.
</p>
<p>
	Etty looked at Wrath, a look of understanding passing between them so easily, like the gonorrhoea your mother passes to any man with a pulse after one too many sherries at the bingo hall on another sad Saturday night.  
</p>
<p>
	“Get your people ready to move, then come join us.” Etty said. “I need a few minutes with my daughters.”

<p>
	TWO DAYS LATER
</p>
<p>
	The funeral procession marched around the moot and settled at Venus’ Vigil, a flat on the hills overlooking Ilima’s capital, where post cataclysm, the early would-be leaders once fought to the death over trivial matters like who remembered the lyrics to the Golden Girls theme tune correctly, or what exactly a Salty Pirate was. Now it was a place for ceremonial funerals, where pyres were lit and the ashes blew where they would. This was the future, but there wasn’t any city ordinance around dead bits in the air.
</p>
<p>
	A black-eyed and swollen-lipped Kellan mingled alongside her mother and brothers, Rin’s hand clasped tightly in hers. He was being so brave, and had barely cried since their father had been stolen away from them in the bombing. Kellan on the other hand, felt like fighting. Everything she knew, had dared to trust, was a lie. She looked around, not knowing who she could truly trust, who might be out to kill her or her family.
</p>
<p>
	Wrath stood with the other pillars in a wide circle around the pyre that her father Korvis lay atop. The Pillars had stood watch over him for two days and two nights (or as we would say 48 hours), whilst the arrangements had been attended to. Wrath stood front and centre, but where the exhausted others used their various ceremonial weapons as support, Wrath stood tall, Doomcock held a little off the floor, as if she had only been there five minutes. The Writ and The Way stood either side of her, both breathing heavily. As soon as the ceremony was started, they would be able to rest and join the mourners. Like all religious pageantry, it was pointless and exhausting.
</p>
<p>
	“Kellan?” Her mother said as she sat next to her, noticing the dagger laden looks she was giving Wrath. 
</p>
<p>
	“I just don’t understand why…?” She started, but her mother cut her off.
</p>
<p>
	“Because she loves you. It may not seem like it right now. Treat her like one of the family.”
</p>
<p>
	At Kellan’s raised eyebrows, Etty Amray exhaled an amused breath. “I wore that face too at first, I didn’t know what to think. But believe me, whatever comes, whatever she says, Wrath has always and will always keep you safe.” 
</p>
<p>
	Kellan let the conversation peter out and drifted amongst the guests until she felt Grorp, the disabled attendant of the pillars of Ilima, sidled up to her in the crowd, walking with his knuckles dragging along the floor. He was treated as a piteous creature by most people, but she had always found him fascinating, looking beyond the disability and wondering what tales of the Pillars he could share. His suspicious nature and hatred for Wrath was legendary, and something Kellan shared right now. With a wizened finger he beckoned Kellan slightly away from her siblings.
</p>
<p>
	“A saddened heart we all possess,
</p>
<p>
	Korvis’ loss is felt, I do confess.”
</p>
<p>
	“Thank you.” Kellan nodded and bent down. “That’s kind of you Gror…”
</p>
<p>
	Group grabbed her hand and whispered to her ear.
</p>
<p>
	“M’Lady is brave, but pay me mind,
</p>
<p>
	If looking for allies, ye be better blind.
</p>
<p>
	One by one they’ll pitch their wares,
</p>
<p>
	Little Rook be wise to spot the snares.
</p>
<p>
	Mark my words, ‘fore day is done,
</p>
<p>
	House of Amray’s fall will have begun.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan looked at Grorp in shock as he slunk back into the crowd, only to see the Technarch of the Norn approaching.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	NOW
</p>
<p>
	The monitor beeping counted the seconds that Kellan had been sat staring at her sister, lying in bed somehow 15 years older than the little girl who had fallen into the Rift a year ago. Kellan was similarly in freefall, unable to get comfortable in the chair by Asher’s bed. All she had wanted for the past 12 months was to get her little sister back. Now here she was, and the first thing Kellan had done was try to gut her. The appropriate thing to do would be to cry, she knew that. She wasn’t normally too good at that on account of her being emotionally repressed, the sort who would recoil at a normal human sign of affection, too aware of her own feelings and therefore naturally suspicious…wait a minute, this isn’t your diary, Masters! Anyway, Kellan wasn’t good with emotions. Instead she stared at the dried blood on her clothes and tried to pick it off. So intent on it was she, that she didn’t notice her mother walk into the room until she put her hand on Kellan’s arm.
</p>
<p>
	“Kellan, are you…”
</p>
<p>
	She jumped into her mother’s arms, burying her head into her jerkin and sobbing heavily. That was what she had needed, what she wanted more than anything, a hug from someone who would share her pain. “I didn’t know, you have to believe me, I didn’t know.”
</p>
<p>
	Etty took her daughter’s face in her hands and stared into her eyes. “I know. How are you feeling?”
</p>
<p>
	“Wait. What are you doing here?” Kellan pushed her mother to arms length and stared at her. “How could you possibly know?”
</p>
<p>
	The door opened, and Wrath walked in as bold as a white man with an opinion on a woman’s reproductive rights. “I asked her not to tell you. It wasn’t the time.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan stood, walked to Wrath and punched her in the jaw. It wasn’t a particularly good punch, it didn’t connect and Wrath barely moved. In fact it was more of a loose wafting, as if she were checking Wrath’s temperature with the back of her hand, but Kellan felt better for it. “And what the hell gives you the right to decide which information I can and can’t have? You’re a nomad with nothing and no one. Find your own family to mess around with.”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath stayed stock still, not even making eye contact. “Come with me, Rook. You and I need to talk. If you’re capable of anything other than guttural monkey noises, that is.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan crossed her arms, knowing she was being petulant, but not caring. “Go tighten your helmet, you chrome-plated cretin.”
</p>
<p>
	It was then that Etty burst into laughter at the sight of the pair of them, prompting them to look at her with narrowed eyes. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry. It’s just I can’t get over how funny you both are together. Go with her, Kellan. Wrath, it’s time to teach her about the Rifts.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	TWO DAYS LATER
</p>
<p>
	The Norn Technarch, a giant CRT television screen with a simulated picture of a face, approached Kellan from the front of the Norn delegation's quadrant of mourners. The Technarch represented every leader of the Norngaard Territories, preserved and digitised to form one, seemingly infallible machine. Being so far away from the homeworld without the proper technological securities meant that Kellan had been easily able to send secure protocols to the monitor and change their functional aesthetics coding, so currently the Technarch was mourning one of their peers as a sad dog with emoji tears.  Their valets had tried to reboot the Technarch, but were worried about this copy of the program so far away from home, so simply left them like it. They wheeled over to her, and because they were on one of those tv stands they used to wheel out at school, the wheels were squeaky and threatened to fall off at any minute.
</p>
<p>
	“You are the one they designate Amray comma Kellan. On behalf of the Norn, I wish to extend a declaration of acknowledgement following the life-cease of Amray comma Korvis.” 
</p>
<p>
	Kellan was taken aback, she had never seen the Technarch offer anyone anything so seemingly pointless as platitude. She could feel the whole congregation watching them, judging her on her actions. “Thank you Technarch. My father always valued your council.”
</p>
<p>
	“As well he should. We are the reliquary of knowledge, the predictive understanding, the entire back catalogue of Detective Conan, One Piece, and JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. Which may seem like an odd flex, but those are large volumes of pre cataclysm data.” The Technarch sounded almost proud. “Your father’s energy will be converted and will serve as a basis for new life. Though he is gone, his energy will ‘live on’.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan smiled. “Thank you, Technarch. That actually is comforting.”
</p>
<p>
	The Technarch paused for a second. “You may want to consider residing in Norn for a season, to help you master those abilities recently acquired.”
</p>
<p>
	It was like a slap around the face. They knew. Maybe all of them knew. She turned around to find every pair of eyes - and Duke Monocles, the one eyed ruler of Occulon - staring at her. 
</p>
<p>
	“Thank you, Technarch. I will…” Kellan started.
</p>
<p>
	“Before others take a more unhealthy interest.” The Technarch interrupted. The sad dog suddenly looked neutral now, as if the Technarch had somehow managed to get control of the code again, but not reverted back,  just to let Kellan know they could have if they wanted to. It was a cold display of control that made Kellan feel small.
</p>
<p>
	He wheeled away on his squeaky wheels, leaving Kellan to attempt to return to her family, before being distracted by a clearing of the throat. She turned around to see a Velitaen beckoning to her. “Our Queen demands your presence.”
</p>
<p>
	“Demands?” Kellan raised an eyebrow.
</p>
<p>
	The attendant looked almost confused. “Her word is law, Lady Kellan.” 
</p>
<p>
	“It’s just Kellan.” She said as she strode over to the Queen. The woman was the epitome of beauty, her flawless, deep red skin matching her largely inappropriate red leather basque and long flowing cape. But it was more than beauty, her flawlessness stretched to how she held herself, how she acted. She wasn’t just sensually curvy, it was as if she was actively forcing the angles out of her pose. Everything was deliberate, everything purposeful. To be honest, now that I think about it, she kinda looked like the evil queen from Battletoads. Just red, because she's an alien, get it? As Kellan approached, the Queen refused to look at her, concerning herself with the whispers of a valet at her side.
</p>
<p>
	“If you wanted to say something to me, I’d make it quick. Dead father and all, busy day.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan’s words certainly got the attention of the Queen, who stopped instantly and glared. Around her all the attendants gasped in shock, affectedly putting their hands to their mouths. It was like watching the feigned affectations of a reality television show. “You are impertinent, aren’t you, child?”
</p>
<p>
	“So they tell me.” Kellan said matter of fact. “But at least I’m not wearing sex clothes to a funeral, or are you moonlighting at the strip club on your way back to Velit?” 
</p>
<p>
	As the valets around Queen Promiscua grew paler, the woman herself leant forward from the litter she was being carried in. “You have dealt with my people before?”
</p>
<p>
	“Unfortunately, yes.” 
</p>
<p>
	The Queen roared with laughter, throwing her head back and putting her hand to her chest. Surrounding her, the valets looked nothing short of relieved. Promiscua leaned in to Kellan, offering her a hand. “I like you, Amray. You’ll fit in well at court on Velit. After I talk to your mother that is.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan kept stony faced, though she could feel her heart trying to escape and go on a road trip. “And why would I do that?”
</p>
<p>
	Promiscua looked taken back. “Because you’re a target my dear. Heaven help you if the Norn, or worse the Reap get ahold of a Riftwalker. I wouldn’t let a unique weapon like that enter the hands of another party.” Promiscua’s eyes narrowed. “I would rather go to war.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	NOW
</p>
<p>
	After enduring a quiet and tense ride out into the deserts of Ilima, the Gloombreaker touched down on the edge of a crater as dry and arid as Mitch McConell’s dementia ridden smooth brain. They stepped off the ship and towards the edge, overlooking the sloped sides that led to a smaller clearing thirty feet below. On the edge of the crater wall on the far side, a giant cave stood.
</p>
<p>
	“Brought me home to meet your family?” Kellan sneered.
</p>
<p>
	Wrath gave her a look. “Got something against people who live in caves?”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan shrugged. “Of course not, the Reap live wild. I spent a year teaching them to read Basic.”
</p>
<p>
	“You spent a year helping yourself feel better, there's a difference.” Wrath pulled the scope from her rifle, Callus, and surveyed the cave. “You’re a privileged little punk who thinks they’re somehow more deserving than others. ‘Teaching the Reap’. Those people have forgotten more about life than you’ll ever know, Rook.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan stood on tiptoes and pushed her chest out to look Wrath in the eye. She poked at Wrath’s armour with a finger. “How dare you. And I told you, you shouldn’t call me Rook!”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath brought Callus around her and planted it in the sand behind Kellan’s feet. “You’re right, Rook is a poor description.” She pushed Kellan in the chest, and Kellan tripped over the rifle. Her sense of gravity was lost instantly and she toppled, rolling like Fred Durst in a hamster wheel. This Podcast is brought to you by the early 2000s - get your trucker hats, Ugg boots, Heel-e shoes and the Motorola Razr at the gift shop.
</p>
<p>
	“Rooks can fly!” Wrath shouted as Kellan tumbled down the sand bank before hitting the floor below with a sick thud.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan pushed herself to her feet, spitting out the sand that she had inhaled on the way down the bank. She glared up at Wrath, standing there on the bank with Callus slung over her shoulders. It wasn’t until Kellan was about to shout an obscenity at her when she realised Wrath wasn’t even looking at her, but the cave.
</p>
<p>
	“What’s the matter, Wrath. Worried that hole has seen more action than yours ever will?” She shouted. “Wouldn’t be difficult, I’ll bet you’re as hard and frigid down there as that armour of yours!”
</p>
<p>
	“I’d whisper if I were you.” Wrath muttered.
</p>
<p>
	“What?!” Kellan began, as she heard ungodly snorts from behind her. She turned slowly, as a Giant Fanghog, the biggest she’d ever seen, nearly as big as the Gloombreaker, came out of the cave, yawning wildly. Wrath put her gun down on the floor, crossed her legs and sat. 
</p>
<p>
	“Come on Wrath, help!” Kellan shouted, backing off until the sandbank was at her back. 
</p>
<p>
	Wrath threw a dagger down into the pit, then sat watching. 
</p>
<p>
	“This isn’t funny.” Kellan shouted as the hog shook its head, revealing the spears sticking out of its neck. The Fanghorn frothed at the mouth, one of it’s eyes red with blood - it was clearly rabid.
</p>
<p>
	“Not meant to be.” Wrath said. “You need a place to direct all this anger. Target’s sure big enough.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan watched as the Fanghorn locked eyes with her and lowered its head as it was about to charge. “How the fuck am I supposed to fight this thing?”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath took off her helm and tied her auburn hair into a ponytail to stop it catching the intense wind. “Because I did.” She whispered. 
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	TWO DAYS LATER
</p>
<p>
	Kellan was in a daze, leaving Queen Promiscua and returning to the Iliman quarter of the mourners to find Minister and Lady Greywood waiting for her. She was so pleased to see a friendly face, and she ran to Aunt Umbra, wrapping her arms around her.
</p>
<p>
	“Well done for doing the rounds.” Umbra said with a smile. “I don’t know if I could do that, given the circumstances.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan sighed, and Umbra squeezed her just a little tighter.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, kiddo. Rough day, huh?” Jiran ruffled her hair as he did when she was young. 
</p>
<p>
	“Like you wouldn’t believe.” Kellan nodded. It was so refreshing to be amongst family, people who didn’t see her as some tool to be used. She stared over at her mother, who looked at her with concern. Kellan nodded, to reassure her she was ok.
</p>
<p>
	Jiran put his arm around Kellan’s shoulders and walked her to her quarter. “It’s a tumultuous time, Kellan. Your father’s passing will damage the stability of the entire region. Some already have their talons out, ready to pounce. The Union and Ilima need to strengthen their bonds, to present a united front.”
</p>
<p>
	“What do you mean?” Kellan felt her stomach sink to her feet.
</p>
<p>
	“Your aunt and I think you should come to New Earth. To rest, get out of the public eye. We might even be able to help you with whatever it is that you’re suffering with at the moment.” Jiran smiled the same smile he had always had, toothy and wide. But now it seemed predatory, as if it might swallow her up if she dared say no. 
</p>
<p>
	A gong sounded to save her from answering and to tell the mourners it was time. Minister and Lady Greywood took their seats in the quadrant of chairs representing the Union of planets, and Umbra Greywood blew a kiss to Kellan. Kellan smiled as naturally as she could, unable to muster the strength for anything but a low hatred.
</p>
<p>
	The pyre was lit, and Rin, Targus and her mother cried beside her as her father was committed to his ancestors. But Kellan had no tears. She just wished her father was here.
</p>
<p>
	One by one, the Pillars of Ilima walked and stood before Etty Amray to offer up their ceremonial weapons for allowing a member of the ruling family to die under their watch. The Word offered her thin, gilded rapier. The Watch offered his Staff of Es Cu Lay Pee Us, carved from a tree of the crystal glen. The Writ offered the kunai, which were shaped like small quills. The Ward, the Pillar in charge of education, offered the weapon he took into classrooms every day - a large cattleprod. One by one, each of them were turned away by Etty until Wrath stood before her and offered Doomcock to her. Before she offered it, Etty pulled her chin up and shook her head in her hands.
</p>
<p>
	“You have done your duty, Pillar. Take your places beside us.” Etty announced. As all of them who could attend hobbled to their seats.
</p>
<p>
	“You were right. Thank you, Wrath.” Kellan whispered as Wrath passed. The Pillar momentarily stopped, her head low, then she took her seat behind Kellan. The rest of the ceremony passed without a hitch. Targus offered to give the eulogy, but their mother refused, saying it was time for strength and not diplomacy. Kellan remembered little of the speech, other than it was less about Korvis and more about the dynasty of the family and the security of the Iliman political structure. With how the wolves were circling at the gates, it was the right call.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly, Wrath put a hand to her shoulder and squeezed. “It will be alright, Rook.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan squeezed her hand back, weird though it was to receive the comfort from her. If anyone knew how she was feeling right now, it was Wrath.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	NOW
</p>
<p>
	The fanghog charged, thankfully still half asleep as it did, and Kellan was able to jump out of the way, as the beast dashed its face into the sand. Dashing away to the far side of the crater, Kellan picked up a rock and looked at Wrath. “What the hell kind of training is this, how to become breakfast? Help me, you maniac!”
</p>
<p>
	“No.” Called Wrath. “I learned how to control my powers much the same way. You will too.”
</p>
<p>
	As the beast charged again, blowing out bubbles of spit and aiming it’s tusks at Kellan, she lobbed the rock straight at the creature’s face. It struck the red eye of the mad pig, causing it to howl in pain and veer off, collapsing into the sand.
</p>
<p>
	“Nice job, if you had a rockery to hand you might be able to kill it in thirty years or so.” Wrath stared intently, not phased in the slightest.
</p>
<p>
	The fanghorn raised up, its head surrounded by a cloud of dust. It roared, and the very air shook around Kellan. She held out her hand as she had when Asher was running from her. The air crackled between her and the hog, and as it ran towards her, it turned slightly away from her at the sight of the attempted rift. As it bore down on Kellan, it grazed her and flung its head to one side, throwing Kellan across the crater where she landed on her hands and knees.
</p>
<p>
	“This isn’t riding a bike, Wrath. This fanghorn doesn’t have training wheels you can just rip off!” 
</p>
<p>
	Wrath stood, raised the rifle and shot, but not at the hog. The bullet struck the sand in front of Kellan, sending a cloud of it up in her face. “Like the woman who taught me said, ‘shut your mouth and do it’. You failed Asher, you failed your father, don’t fail me too. If you do, you’re better off dead.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan screamed in fury, sick of Wrath and her fucking pompous self righteousness, sitting up on the bank and judging her. She directed all her rage - at her mother for her strictness, at her father for dying, at Asher for being gone so long, at herself for being an evergreen fuck up of the highest proportions - directly at the fanghorn coming to skewer her. A taste of acidity rippled on the air as the air burned and the rift opened in between them. From the otherside, she could hear music, the most beautiful thing she had ever heard.
</p>
<p>
	‘Poppa been smooth since days of Underoos
</p>
<p>
	Never lose, never choose to, bruise crews who’
</p>
<p>
	She stepped forward, she could see the people on a street corner dancing, spinning off shoulders and heads in the most amazing ways. Laughing, drinking. She wanted to walk through, to be free of all this.
</p>
<p>
	The fanghog turned suddenly around the Rift and swiped at Kellan, taking a gouge out of her arm with its broken tusk. Kellan screamed and fell away to the floor cradling an arm that was spitting blood over the floor. She had never felt pain like it, a burning that made her sick to her stomach and threatening to force her to pass out. The beast stalked her, stepping adjacent to the Rift, but Kellan couldn’t push away.
</p>
<p>
	“Yo man, what’s that pig looking thing?” A voice came from the other side.
</p>
<p>
	Wrath stood, and with what looked like a force that pained her, pulled the RIft into the fanghog’s face. She then closed her hands into fists, forcing the Rift closed. It severed the beast at the neck, leaving a severed head in 1997 Cleveland, Ohio. Scientists would later cover up the incident and use the DNA to birth the abomination that is Jake Paul.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan passed out as Wrath slid down the bank towards her.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	She woke the next day, bruised and bloodied, her arm tightly bandaged. Her head pounded like your average Brit the day after a Christmas office party, or a Christening, or like a Tuesday. She looked at Wrath, the campfire she had set to keep them warm reflecting off her chrome helm.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s dead.” She answered a question before Kellan could ask, anticipating it. “You did good.”
</p>
<p>
	“Good?!” Kellan sat up and wished she hadn’t her brain trying to blow itself out of the back of her skull. “You tried to kill me, you deranged, fucking lunatic!”
</p>
<p>
	“I did what I had to.” Wrath poked at the fire with a stick. Kellan could tell she was mad, she had the same tells that she did, avoidant gaze, tensing up, sulking like a fucking bitch. “You need to learn and quickly, things are happening you couldn’t fathom.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan threw a nearby stone and it bounced off of Wrath’ helm. “I don’t know because you won’t talk to me. You had knowledge of threats on my family and you didn’t tell me. Asher was back and you didn’t tell me. You have lied to me for a year, probably my whole life.” Kellan was crying now, tears streaming down her face though she tried to will them not to. She was angry, and didn’t want Wrath to just dismiss it just as emotion. “Who the hell are you to dictate the course of my life like this? Why do you hate me so much?”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath pulled the cloak she was using to warm herself and dropped it alongside them, then reached up to her helm, as she took it off, Kellan noticed the scarring on her forearm. It was a deep gash. She stared at her own bandages.
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t hate you.” Kellan looked up to see the auburn hair and freckled nose of her own adult face. “I am you, Rook.”
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
