<p>
	Brokepeace was a place riddled with contradiction, like how Elon Musk got to control three of the most influential companies in their field with the emotional intelligence of a 13 yr-old incel with an axe body spray dependency - oh wait, that’s not complicated, his parents gave him fucktons of money and no moral code! Brokepeace’s hodgepodge melting pot of alien cultures and lifestyles was unlike anywhere in the galaxy. Norn techno-temples and hub-sanctuaries sat comfortably next to Velit sex houses and dust-bars, both sandwiching the Union planets government buildings, green spaces and…er…what’s a good building to demonstrate the middle ground…massage libraries? Yeah, whatever, that’ll do. It’s not like I have a consultant to help me with this writing now, is it? Look, you think of something if you’re that clever….oh literally anything else. Alright, you win this round, listener.
</p>
<p>
	The settlement was formed over 300 years ago, on the site of the final conflict of the Galactic War, a Battle named…The Final Battle. The war itself had been fought over the most valuable of resources, more valuable than fuel, or food, or territory…this war had been fought over sweet ass. It was said that a voracious teen Velitaen princess had seduced a Norn lord and stolen his virginity away before an arranged marriage that would have settled some border disputes. After a century of fighting, the hapless exploring Humans of the Unionised Planets did what Humans did best, they stuck their big fucking noses into other peoples business. They stupidly and well meaningly tried to save a Feldar transport from destruction in the Veil and got themselves introduced to the two biggest powers in the known universe by way of half a century of interstellar war. Then as quickly and as pointlessly as it started…it stopped, and no one but the powers that be knew why. 
</p>
<p>
	When the dust settled - both figuratively and literally as a lot of drugs were consumed at the signing of the treaty - Brokepeace was named an independent and neutral territory for all as a sign of collaboration and because dead civilians had been exceedingly bad for profit lines at large corporations. There were two main conditions for peace, the first was the installation of an independent and anonymous judiciary force, picked from the three main galactic powers - named the Pillars of Ilima. The second was a democratically elected leader. Given the 500 years of bloody conflict and all around distrust and hatred, any reasonable person (even Grothgar the Reckless of the Ginger Clan who lost the battle of Hanar when he ordered his entire fleet into a nearby sun when he thought the light was a direct attack on his people) would have believed it nigh impossible. But the three empires did something extremely uncharacteristic - they gave the nomadic people of the Veil a vote. When the Norn, the Velit, and the Union Planets voted for themselves, the Feldar voted for the people that tried to help them during the war, one act of charity, paying dividends.
</p>
<p>
	And so, the Union had controlled Brokepeace for almost 300 years, to the point where the 5-yearly vote seemed as pointless as prayers at JK Rowling’s deathbed. The Union were now voted for by all four parties, mainly due to the proven impartiality and success of Union rule, the Velit and Norn not wanting the other to take control, and the fact that the Union had made it a capital offence to not say thank you when someone holds a door open for you. The current ruler of Brokepeace was none other than Kellan’s own father, Korvis Amray.
</p>
<p>
	As Kellan watched the planet of Ilima grow large through the viewscreen of Wrath’s ship, The Gloombreaker, she was simultaneously hit with a deep joy at the sight of the crystal buildings and blue oceans, and intense anxiety of having to face her family again. 
</p>
<p>
	Wrath caught her clutching her stomach uncomfortably. “If you are going to vomit, I suggest you do it in the airlock. That way, I can space the mess and the offender at the same time.”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s just felt more real since we left Agent Princess back on Velit.” Kellan shewed on her fingernail. “You think they’ll treat me any differently?”
</p>
<p>
	“Considering you are still a burdensome trouble maker with all the use of lipstick on a horses’ arsehole, I think not.” Wrath stuck the ship on autopilot and spun her chair with a tired sigh. “I once returned home after a…difficult ordeal. Everything felt wrong, the passage of time felt more keenly by me than others due to my age. On reflection, given the circumstances, my family tried their best. But parents are not infallible, regardless of what ideals we have. They are idiots, just the same as we are.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan sat. “I guess that makes me feel a little better.”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath grunted. “It wasn’t meant to. You are going to have a terrible, awful day. But at the end of it, you will be stronger to face the next thing.”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re an inspiration, Wrath.” Kellan rolled her eyes, and left the cockpit to grab her bags.
</p>
<p>
	Wrath started after her. “Gods, I hope not, kid.” She whispered.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	The spaceport had changed, but Kellan asked herself if that was because she felt so much older now. She looked at the public park where she used to meet her friends and smoke weed, or the shake shop where she would moan about her studies with the girls and smoke weed, or the hypercade, where she would pretend she was a poor urchin so she could use her fighting training to hustle much older guys in VR kickboxing and smoke vr weed and smoke weed. She earned a pretty penny that summer, and spent it all on the things that most teenagers would in her position, copious amounts of recreational drugs and videogames. 
</p>
<p>
	Wrath pushed her onward. “It looks small and insignificant because you saw your sister vanish in front of you, and you’ve been away and seen beyond all this. Stop pretending it’s something new. You’re not JD Salinger, you’re just a normal kid.”
</p>
<p>
	As she wondered how Wrath had read her mind, Kellan watched a group of hot guys approach them with bodies and arms ripped straight out of her less repeatable swimwear catalogue daydreams. “Speaking of wet, hubba hubba.”
</p>
<p>
	“Getting thrown in the lockup for sexual harassment would not be the least glorious way to return home…” Wrath started, before Kellan pretended to drop something and bent over in front of the men. “Well done, Rook, you’ve found new depths to plumb.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’d let them plumb my depths.” Kellan said under her breath. “What? Come on Wrath, it’s been a long year. I’ve gone through more batteries on that space station than ration packs.”
</p>
<p>
	“At last, something to put on the Amray family coat of arms.” Wrath shook her head.
</p>
<p>
	“Excuse me, Ma’am.” The lead man said as he stopped in front of them and stopped, clicking his heels together like a tin soldier. “I am Lieutenant Braynum, here to escort you both to the capitol building under a low profile.”
</p>
<p>
	“More low profile than us not walking with a group of five burly men standing so straight it looks like they have their stiffies in their waistbands?” Kellan smirked.
</p>
<p>
	“The child has a point.” Wrath nodded. “Also, I intended to report to Mount Barbaros before I checked in with the General and Duke Amray.” Oh god, not Barbaros, the home of the Pillars. The joyless ones would sit in their circles of stone and debate for hours about morality and strategy and the ways of the universe and which colour was better pebble grey or battleship grey, or whatever. Kellan thought it over, that would be slightly preferable to seeing her family again.
</p>
<p>
	“Sorry, Lady Wrath, I…er.” The man was clearly terrified, he was outranked by Wrath, who could legally skin him and use his bones to turn him into a human pop tent if she wanted to without any repercussions.
</p>
<p>
	“Wow, stuck between a cock and a hard place, aren’t you?” Kellan smiled, enjoying the pomp and circumstance of it all coming crashing down.
</p>
<p>
	Wrath sighed. “We’ll visit the family first, if only to watch Duchess Amray here squirm a bit.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	“So, you’re back then?” Targus said, his arms crossed across his political garb. As the older brother and first born of the family, he had two options: Military or Senate. Targus of course chose politics, and at the grand age of 20 was a willing dogsbody in the Velitean embassy. He would move into Iliman political office next year with a position that would no doubt match his inflated ego. She foresaw more than a few scandals in his future.
</p>
<p>
	“Looks like the exposure to politics has kept your wits extra sharp, brother.” Kellan said. “Why are you here? You couldn't have possibly run out of arses to stick your nose into?”
</p>
<p>
	“You haven’t changed, Rook” Targus smiled. “Still the same old Kellan, the adopted sister who thinks she is better than a true Highborne. Another year older and still just as rough around the edges.”
</p>
<p>
	“Better to be a turd than a polished turd, your Lordship.” Wrath entered the room and threw a bag down on the floor between them. “Does the Velitean Embassy have any business here today, or did you just want your picture in the papers next to daddy?”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan laughed. “Oh get wrecked, little Lord Limpdick!” 
</p>
<p>
	Targus’ pointed face turned a brilliant shade of red. “You can’t talk to me like that, Wrath! You’re a Pillar of Ilima, and you are…”
</p>
<p>
	She pointed to her chest. “Impartial. Autonomous. And not answerable to pimply little pissants with delusions of grandeur.” Wrath sat down on a chaise-long that probably cost more than she would make in her whole lifetime and put her muddy boots up on it. She made a mock bow. “Will that be all, M’lord?”
</p>
<p>
	Targus stormed out, his hands in clenched fists by his side, and slammed the door making the whole, well appointed drawing room shake. It was all Kellan could do not to shriek with laughter.
</p>
<p>
	“That wasn’t sensible.” came a small voice in the back of the room, and Kellan noticed two small shoes sticking out from the bottom of the curtains bordering the large window that looked out onto the grounds. “Targus is mean after he’s embarrassed.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan ran to the curtains and reached her hand inside to tickle the body behind it. “You sneaky little Bug. You shouldn’t listen to grown ups when they don’t know you’re there.”
</p>
<p>
	Rin pulled the curtain back, his button nose crinkled in confusion. “But then how will I ever find out anything? No one tells me anything.” He looked up at her. “You’ve been gone a long time. I’ve broken a lot of your stuff.”
</p>
<p>
	Her brother had lost some of the cuteness that he possessed when he was smaller, but that was for the best. As fourth born, Rin would be given Education or Health, lisping and pronouncing your Rs as Ws wouldn’t get you much credibility in those professions.  She poked him in the guts and made him chuckle. “Of course you did, you little weasel. Where are the oldies, Bug?
</p>
<p>
	Rin pointed to the door to the waiting room and the office beyond. “They’ve been talking about you all morning, Kellan.”
</p>
<p>
	She kissed her brother’s mop of blonde hair and stepped towards the office. “Well, time I stoked those fires a bit. You’ll wait for me, Wrath?” But when she turned back, Wrath had already left, a trail of muddy boot prints leading back out of the room.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	General Etti Amray looked at the plate of Velitean cream puffs her husband had brought her and wondered if a third would make her burst out of her breastplate. Why had the gods given her enough willpower to command an interstellar army but not to resist those sugary demons? Korvis Amray, the Duke of Brokepeace, her husband and best friend, stroked his immaculate beard and then plonked himself down into the chair at the farside of her office. He was restless, and he crossed and uncrossed his legs. “I got word from the guard - she’s back. What time do you think she’ll be here?”
</p>
<p>
	Etti smiled wryly, trying not to look Korvis in the eyes - all their conversations about Kellan ended in argument lately. “I asked Wrath to bring her right to us, but you and I know Wrath only does what she thinks is best for her.” 
</p>
<p>
	Korvis exhaled a laugh, then gave Etti a stare. “Well we can’t blame Wrath for being self motivated, given the circumstances. She has a large stake in this.” Korvis’ face softened. “I’m glad Kellan is back though, aren’t you?”
</p>
<p>
	“No. She should have stayed away.”
</p>
<p>
	Korvis stood. He was clearly annoyed, but not at her, it was the situation. “I’m sure she’ll love to hear you say that.”
</p>
<p>
	Etti hated this - this talking. She wasn’t one for sharing feelings and having conversations and all that trash. Put a rifle and a claymore in her hands and she would convey her feelings accurately enough - when you maimed an enemy they knew exactly how you felt. There were days when conflict was far easier than family. “You know what I meant, Kovis. We should send her back to the station and leave her there until we can sort all this.”
</p>
<p>
	“Nice to know things never change. Parents are still dicks and make decisions about their kids when they’re not in the room.” Kellan pushed the door to Etti’s office open. It had been ajar, how long had she been there? Kellan nodded to each of them in turn. “Dad. General.” 
</p>
<p>
	Korvis went to his daughter and swept her up in his arms, then grabbed her face to look at her, assessing each feature in turn. He was such a good father, it made Etti’s eye’s momentarily water until she blinked her composure back. 
</p>
<p>
	“You have no idea how glad I am to see you. I’ve missed you so much.” Korvis said.
</p>
<p>
	“Glad one of you has.” Gods, Kellan looked at her with such unbridled hatred. But her daughter had become so beautiful - the awkward, lofty teen she had been now a lithe and striking young woman. Etti wanted to go to her, but she stood firm. There was a time and a place, and this wasn’t it.
</p>
<p>
	Etti breathed a deep sigh, they were so similar, so eager to fight, to give a killing blow with each sentence. Though Kellan wasn’t born to the family, and though parents weren’t meant to have a favourite but absolutely did, Etti wondered if she loved Kellan the most out of all of them.
</p>
<p>
	“Kellan, you have some…matters to discuss with your mother, but I’ll be waiting outside for a quick chat.” Korvis went to grab his overcoat and walked as he talked, never a fan of doing one job when two could be done. “I have business in the senate with the Feldar, they’re coming around to the idea of joining the Union.”
</p>
<p>
	Etti rounded her desk, suddenly overcome. She held her husband, too much to say in too little time. “Korvis, do…do you have to? Can’t you send another in your place? Today of all days.”
</p>
<p>
	Korvis smiled, then kissed his beloved on the forehead. “Etti. You know I have to go, there's too much at stake if I don’t. You’ll both be fine.” He looked over to Kellan and gave her a wink, then turned and left, closing the giant doors to Etti’s office behind him.
</p>
<p>
	Etti took a few seconds to compose herself, knowing this was going to be as much fun as  experimental butt surgery. She took a deep, settling breath and gestured to the chair, but Kellan stood there with her arms crossed. 
</p>
<p>
	“So you didn’t want me to come home, huh? What’s the matter, am I a tarnish on one of those medals you pin to your chestplate? Perhaps they can give you a new one for the most inconsistent mother? Or maybe it’s just easier to shove the kids you didn’t birth under the rug?”
</p>
<p>
	Etti put her head in her hands, it was just the same as when they’d sent her to the watch station. Kellan’s pain was so raw, so exposed. This wasn’t how she wanted things to go. “You were sent out there for your own good, Kellan.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan picked up a cream cake and shoved it in her mouth in one. “Yeah, it worked wonders. I worked on my novel, got some sick abs, started eating right. And here I was thinking that you sent me out there because you blamed me for Ashr’s death.”
</p>
<p>
	“You can’t believe that?” Etti was dumbstruck, her mouth agape at the venom. She stood and walked to Kellan, she put a hand on her daughter’s shoulder. “You were sent away to keep you safe, I promise.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan pushed her mother’s hand away. “You know what they say - ‘whatever doesn’t kill you either makes you immune-compromised or completely distrustful of every being you once loved’.”
</p>
<p>
	Etti forced her daughter into the chair, then perched on the end of her desk, she blew out air and waited until Kellan was looking at her. “Ashr’s death wasn’t your fault.”
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t ‘Good Will Hunting’ me, mother.” Kellan laughed a sick laugh. “You’re not as lovable as Robin Williams.” 
</p>
<p>
	 Etti stood and turned away from her, tired of this. “You are impossible. I lost a daughter, just as you lost a sister. We were all grieving!”
</p>
<p>
	“So you sent me to the border so you didn’t have to look at me.”
</p>
<p>
	“No, we did it to save your life!” Etti had said too much, a hand rushing to her mouth. Kellan looked afraid, Etti unable to let things stay like this. She put a hand on her daughters. “Kellan, your life was in danger because of what happened.”
</p>
<p>
	“Because of an accident?!” Kellan threw her head back and laughed hard. “You’ve fed me some shit before, but this is the dung souffle of lies. Where has this brown nugget come from then?”
</p>
<p>
	Etti had come too far, she had to tell her now. “Wrath told us.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan stood, her face twisted by hate and betrayal. Much as she’d hate to admit it, Wrath was probably one of the only people Kellan could call friend, to feel so betrayed by her would be like salt in the wound. She resolved, right there, to tell The Pillars that she had taken her to see the Rift in The Veil. She would have revenge, petty or otherwise, for her lie of omission for this year.
</p>
<p>
	Etti reached for her, but she pulled away. “We’ll just see about that.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Kellan marched out of the office with such a fury that she slammed straight into her father, who had been waiting outside.
</p>
<p>
	“Woah! Where’s the fire?” Korvis said, holding his hands up to his daughter.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan strode past him, not even slowing. “I’ll speak to you later, Dad, I’ve got to have a word with Wrath The word is ass-whuppin.”
</p>
<p>
	“But Kellan!” Korvis shouted after her.
</p>
<p>
	As Kellan broke into a run, she shouted back over her shoulder. “Later, Dad!”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	The climb up Mount Barbaros had been extremely tiring, not made easier by the tourists that were attempting the climb asking Wrath for selfies, or tips on how to reach the top. Every time someone asked, she would use her dagger to snip the oxygen feed on their tanks so they would have to turn around and return home. Not that they would have been able to get there anyway, there were hidden tunnels and tricks only the initiated could find. No one but the Pillars and their attendant could make it up to the summit, that was the point.
</p>
<p>
	And when she got to the top, she entered the adjoining chamber to the Quiet Hall and crossed to what The Word used to call ‘the well of eternal stick up arse-ness’. The idea was that to clean yourself of outside biases, you would take a dipper of water and wash the armour you could never remove in another's company. It was grade A bullshit, but she did it anyway to avoid being ostracised by her fellows.
</p>
<p>
	“In the water douse your sin,
</p>
<p>
	Before the shitstorm does begin.”
</p>
<p>
	“Hello, Grorp.” Wrath said without turning. The attendant of the Pillas, Grorp, lived here amongst the pillars, serving as their butler, their cook, and the person who always organised the collections for birthdays. He had been the previous Wrath’s man-at-arms, and when she had died in a tragic ‘show off with a sword at a party and accidentally cut your own head off’ accident, the sword had fallen onto Grorp and severed part of his spinal column. Now he stood at a right angle, bent double, brain injured and blind. He hated her, seeing her as somehow responsible for her predecessor’s carelessness. “Is everyone here?”
</p>
<p>
	“Always last, the Wrath makes wait,
</p>
<p>
	Rumour is you stopped to masterbate?”
</p>
<p>
	“A rumour you started no doubt. I was attending to Pillar business. Nothing a little worm like you need concern yourself with.” Wrath dropped the dipper and left the vile thing. “I’ll see my own way to the Quiet Hall.”
</p>
<p>
	Grorp called after her, rubbing his eye in mock crying. 
</p>
<p>
	“Take care the floor is cleaned, but wet
</p>
<p>
	Don’t slip and dash your brains, I’ll fret.”
</p>
<p>
	She closed the door behind her and entered the Quiet Hall. They were all here waiting for her, apart from the Wraith of course, who as Ilima’s chief assassin, never visited Barbaros often. Each of them sat crosslegged on the stony floor (as whoever set this system up seemed to want to punish them with eventual and painful haemorrhoids), a cool blue flame burning in the centre of their meeting. When the blue flame went out, they would retire, and would not be able to meet again for thirty days and nights. Any business they had would have to be discussed and decided upon here, or action could not take place.
</p>
<p>
	There was the Lion helm of The Will, the religious leader, who taught both the new scripture and the ways of the old terran colonies. She was around the same age as Wrath, but she had been prepared for her role since she was a child, indoctrinated in the ways of the gods. She was a blowhard narc of the highest order, and had all the wit and charm of a diuretic fart in an elevator.
</p>
<p>
	There was the Owl helm of The Ward, who was the head of education and training. He was the keeper of the caste system, and kept the records of what the first born sons and daughters of Ilima chose as their paths of service. He, like most teachers, was exhausted 24/7 and hated children with a burning passionate vengeance. He always joked that he was far more equipped to be the Wrath, as he went into battle against an army every day.
</p>
<p>
	The Watch, wearing the Snake helm representing Healthcare, sat next to him. They were haughty and aloof, concerning themselves with the welfare of the peoples of Ilima. They drank like a fish, smoked like a train and ate only the finest, richest food in Ilima. They also were quite addicted to prostitutes, which Wrath kept in her back pocket if any need for blackmail purposes presented themselves.
</p>
<p>
	The Stag helm next to The Watch belonged to The Way, the Science leader. He was a quirky genius, and hated The Will with a burning vengeance. He would challenge every one of her nonsense religious claims with fact and proof, which only seemed to goad the Will into quoting scripture with smug superiority. As chief scientist, Wrath had a constant need to issue reports to the Way over the frequency, type and density of each rift. He made Wrath make recordings of all the noises coming from each rift, and when they used the rifts, The Way was always eager to come along, little nerd that he was.
</p>
<p>
	Next to him was the The Fox helm of The Writ, the chief law and policy maker. The Writ was the most jovial and kind of all the Pillars, mostly because he knew that he was the most necessary. Without him the whole system of government fell apart, and as such the other Pillars were kind to him, even those that didn’t really want to be. His pleasant smiles hid a cutting sense of humour, and he could say whatever he wanted in these halls without fear of reprisal.
</p>
<p>
	Lastly, the Word’s Dove helm was placed on the floor directly opposite the door. She was missing, last seen in an altercation with the Reap on Ihop-Comcast-TimeWarner planet 4. She was the chief ambassador, mouthpiece and comms lead of Ilima, she was a good friend to Wrath, and often accompanied her to provide newscasts when on military manoeuvres. She was the only one who could match Wrath drink for drink, and she had been gone for two seasons. Wrath missed her terribly.
</p>
<p>
	“Come sister, regale us with wonders worked in the name of the Gods.” The Will proclaimed, her arms wide in pretend friendship.
</p>
<p>
	Wrath groaned as she lowered herself cross legged on the flagstones. “Emptied my bowels earlier, does that count?”
</p>
<p>
	“Blasphemer.” The Lion stared at her. “You assume too…”
</p>
<p>
	“Enough.” The Ward said before lifting his helm slightly to gulp from a beer glass. “I spend my day around children, I don’t wish to be in their presence now.”
</p>
<p>
	The Watch shook his snake head. “Let them fight. I for one grow sick of the constant bickering the Will engenders. Religion is a bias that should not hold sway in this hall.”
</p>
<p>
	“You do enough swaying for all of us, you drunkard.” The Writ said wryly.  “Much as I’m loathe to admit it, a portion of the idiot populace need their religion as much as their education, law, or medicine. What did you find, Wrath?”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Kellan had taken one look at Mount Barbaros and said “Fuck that.”, then did what any self-respecting daughter of the leader of the planet would do - she chartered a shuttle to take her to the top. She’d beaten Wrath by about four hours, which gave her more than enough time to sneak into the Quiet Hall past the blind hunchback and climb into the metal rafters high above the room to watch them all file in. It was hot up here, the heat from the flame roasting the ventless ceiling. The assembled Pillars didn’t say much until Wrath entered the building and the blue flame was lit, and then Kellan heard more than she had ever bargained for.
</p>
<p>
	“The Reap took the bait, and one of my agents led me right to a Rift.” Wrath went on.
</p>
<p>
	The group sat up a little straighter. “The future, the past?” The Way asked, his science interest piqued. “What did the rift show you, Wrath?”
</p>
<p>
	“Nothing useful.” Wrath admitted. “The Rift had been corrupted, demonic voices tried to take me, but I resisted them.”
</p>
<p>
	“Really? Demons seem like your sort of bedfellow, sister.” The Will smirked under her Lion helm. “What did you do?”
</p>
<p>
	“I closed the Rift, then collected the child and brought her back to her parents.” Wrath said, and as a few shocked exclamations came from the gathering, Wrath held her hands out. “There’s no denying the pull is getting stronger, what would you have me do?”
</p>
<p>
	“The portals are a doorway to the heavens. If that child is perverting them, she should be put to death.” The Will stood and pointed at Wrath. “And if you don’t have the zeal to do it, I will!”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan couldn’t breathe, why did they want to kill her, and what the hell did she have to do with the Rifts? Her hands started to grow slick with sweat, and the metal strut she was holding for support grew harder to grip.
</p>
<p>
	Wrath stood and drew Doomcock, her trusty warhammer, levelling it directly at Will. Keln was shocked to see such fervour in Wrath’s defence of her. “Try and take her, you’ll learn your fairytale gods are fake a lot earlier than you would like.”
</p>
<p>
	The rest stood, shouting over each other until The Writ spoke loudly over everyone. “It’s far too late for that now. The girl isn’t a girl any longer. The Rifts are getting more frequent and Duchess Amray doesn’t have the protection needed to ward herself from the Rifts. I propose she join the ranks, learn what she needs to.”
</p>
<p>
	The Ward nodded. “ Not a bad idea. If anyone knows Rifts, it’s this group.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan’s hand slipped from the metal support and she quickly wrapped her cramping leg around the upright to steady herself. Sweat ran down her forehead and into her eyes - she was going to fall if she couldn’t right herself quickly.
</p>
<p>
	“Volunteering are we?” The Watch asked, their mouth turning up in a small smirk.
</p>
<p>
	“Fuck no!” The Ward shuddered. “I don’t need to play wet nurse for another punk who thinks they know everything.”
</p>
<p>
	The Will exhaled, her metallic Lion eyes settling on Wrath. “Sounds like the perfect job for our warmaker. They’d be a match made in heaven.”
</p>

	Kellan fell like Twitter stock, twenty feet to the floor below in a heap of sweat and bruises. She wasn’t injured, because young people are unfairly blessed with indestructible bodies, unlike the post 37 crowd, who can’t get up without straining something. When Kellan looked up, the entire set of Pillars were looking down at her disapprovingly.

<p>
	If Kellan had known who Rodney Dangerfield was, she would have pulled at her collar as she said: “Anyone call for a know-everything punk?”

	Grorp came running in panicked and afraid. Leaving the doors to the temple open to the elements. Thick black smoke was tendrilling up from town and painting the sky an ashy black.
</p>
<p>
	“For interruption, Grorp should not be blamed,
</p>
<p>
	The senate building lies in flames.”
</p>
<p>
	The Pillars turned to look at each other, as Kellan realised just what that meant. “Dad.” She whispered.
</p>
<p>
	THE END
