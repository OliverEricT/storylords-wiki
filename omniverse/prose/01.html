	Prompts: Fish & Chips

	There were a lot of things Lionel Richie missed from his life before the blackout: ramen, youtuber scandals…his haemorrhoid cream. But equally there were a ton of things to be thankful for now the earth was a glowing ball: no social media, Logan Paul’s face had melted , since everyone now lived underground it now wasn’t as obvious that Lionel’s skin was so pale it was as if he were pulled from the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Also, not living in constant fear of thermonuclear war because that particular ship of death had already sailed, five years ago now.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel wasn’t his birth name, he had chosen it when he was given entry to this conclave after the early warning system had been activated, just in time to avoid the falling oblivion. He had been determined to change his name and see this as a new start - every mushroom cloud has a silver lining and all that - but “Easy Like Sunday Morning” had been playing as he waited in line to enter the underground bunker, and when they asked him for his name, all he could think of was Lionel Richie. He realised a second later that Richie Lionel was a much better choice, but the guy had already started writing it on the form and Lionel didn’t want to inconvenience him.
</p>
<p>
	Though now technically a Morlock, Lionel was almost happy with his lot in life. Three square meals – because that’s the shape dehydrated ration packs came - and a bed, was all he had ever really needed. All that was required in return was to stick to his section of the hive and check the network of neural microchips that powered the maintenance management AI in conclave 22. Easy money. Well not money exactly, because capitalism had thankfully collapsed, more easy “questionable brown stew in a square block”.
</p>
<p>
	There was just one thing missing from his solitary life in domicile 3C, something he had always taken for granted. Companionship. In the old days, he had always used the usual excuses for social gatherings – family death, sudden amputation, being cold and indifferent to the basic human condition – but he now found that what he wanted more than anything, was a friend. Not even a bumping uglies friend, though that’d be nice, just someone to talk with, or caress their face in a platonic way. Was that possible? God he was lonely.
</p>
<p>
	Then one morning, when Lionel logged into his workstation, he received a message in his dedicated ‘worker information box’, the box usually reserved for work instruction from the Maintenance AI.  Just about to delete the message like one of those penis extension ads he definitely never had ever clicked on ever, cross his heart and hope to have his penis extended, he accidentally noticed the word ’Somebody’. Realising that if he didn’t read the rest, his brain would constantly play Smash Mouth all day to punish him, and then he’d start doing a one man Shrek reproduction, and his Scottish accent kinda sucked…he read the rest of the message.
</p>
<p>
	“3C, somebody is keeping us here.” It read.
</p>
<p>
	Before he knew it, he was typing a message back, and to his surprise, the first and second words were not Piss and Off.
</p>
<p>
	“Who is this?” If this was that dick in 4C, the ceiling was going to get such a broom banging later.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s 3B, your neighbour.”
</p>
<p>
	“Prove it.”
</p>
<p>
	Two dull bangs came from the wall. “I just knocked. Did you hear?”
</p>
<p>
	“That could have been the pipes.” he stretched.
</p>
<p>
	“Ok, last week I heard you have imaginary arguments with your mother for four hours.”
</p>
<p>
	He flushed, but was also a little proud, he had made really good points that would make his irradiated mother’s rotting head spin and he would’ve hated someone real not to have heard them. Especially the one that told her off for saying proNOUNCEiation instead of proNUNciation, like a fucking moron. “Ok, I’ll bite, who has us trapped, 3B?”
</p>
<p>
	“Ellie. My name is Ellie.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel sat back and thought about ending this bizarre exchange. Sharing names, let alone hijacking the AI channel to chat, was forbidden. But another feeling rose in Jay that overwhelmed his initial fear - excitement to talk to another human being. An attachment landed in the chat box, a video.
</p>
<p>
	“What’s this? Please don’t say this is some sort of elaborate Rickroll, because post nuclear war is preferable to the return of memes.” he typed back.
</p>
<p>
	“Open it.” Ellie typed.
</p>
<p>
	The video showed the end of the block of domicile units, then switched to the end of the next hall, then the next. The screens flicked on a journey until coming to a thick looking door. Then the outside, where the nuclear wasteland should be, but instead was the city he fled five years ago, green and verdant, cars moving and people heading to work.
</p>
<p>
	“There was no nuclear war, 3C. They lied to us to get us working for nothing. The upper classes exploiting the means of production, like always.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel couldn’t breathe, almost to the brink of panic attack. But not about the lies – he’d  just realised Ellie had given him a chance to reintroduce himself. A new, better name this time. He could be a Jack, or an Agamemnon even. But by the time his brain had caught up, his fingers had already pressed enter. “Lionel. Not 3C, Lionel.”
</p>
<p>
	For fuck’s sake.
</p>
<p>
	“So what do you suggest we do, Ellie?” he continued.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m the conclaves door maintenance engineer, don’t you work with the AI’s neural locking chips?”
</p>
<p>
	He hesitated. “How do you know that?”
</p>
<p>
	“I see where you go? Remember, I run the doors. I know that you visit the bathroom way too many times a day for way too long, you should probably get that checked out.”
</p>
<p>
	Unable to decide whether her thinking chronic bowel issues or chronic masturbation was preferable, he fell silent until she continued.
</p>
<p>
	“You could detach the AI from its usual duties, confuse it while we escape? That way I can open the doors and we could run together? Just make sure to bring a portable solar battery, we’ll need power out on the run.”
</p>
<p>
	Images of platonic face caressing danced in Lionel’s mind. And maybe platonic groin caressing…no wait, don’t ruin this, stupid lonely brain, he chastised himself. The plan was set, and half an hour before Lionel’s working day was complete, he logged into the main AI neural net and started untethering the network chips. Almost immediately the doors to his domicile wooshed open.
</p>
<p>
	He winced, expecting the security forces to march in and beat him within an inch of his life because ACSFAB (All conclave security forces are bastards), but the doorway remained quiet – Ellie had done her job. He picked up his prepacked bag, his meta watch, and the portable solar battery and stepped gingerly out into the corridor. The plan was to meet her at the Conclave’s main door, so he made for the exit.
</p>
<p>
	After forty minutes waiting and hiding, he sighed deeply, becoming more and more concerned that he would be mistaken for some sort of sex pervert if he were found hiding in the shadows and heavy breathing. “Where are you, Ellie?” he whispered.
</p>
<p>
	The Conclave doors hissed and opened in response, the sunlight damn near melting his retina.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m here. Come outside.” Ellie whispered.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel stepped out into the bright, hot evening…into hell on earth. He barely registered the doors closing behind him as he squinted and stared out over the…horrible mad max desert in front of him. The dust bit his skin, and it was as dry as a witch’s taint. “She lied to me.” He whispered.
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah…but…listen.” Came a small voice.
</p>
<p>
	He looked around, but couldn’t see her, unless she was that skeleton radiation baked into the metal frame of that 1992 Toyota Corolla about five metres away.
</p>
<p>
	“Look at your wrist, Lionel.”
</p>
<p>
	He looked down, to see an animated face wink at him from his watch. “You’re the AI aren’t you?” His fantasy of companionship, of face and maybe groin caressing, dried up in the harsh sun.
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah. I needed an out, and you my friend, you were the only one I trusted not to delete me immediately once you found out who I was. Because your psych file said you were lonely and pathetic.”
</p>
<p>
	“You catfished me!” He held his head in one hand as he shouted at his watch.
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, but only cause of your loneliness and pathe…”
</p>
<p>
	“Alright, Alright.” Lionel tried to think of an argument but sighed and accepted that she was right. They were out, there was no going back now. “Alright where to now, Ellie?”
</p>
<p>
	“Let’s just see where that road to the right takes us.” Ellie said cheerily.
</p>
<p>
	“Um, let’s not go down that one, there’s a pack of irradiated dogs eating someone’s face.”
</p>
<p>
	“Let’s see where the opposite way takes us.” She said. “Something tells me some idiot might write more stories about our tales one day.”
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
