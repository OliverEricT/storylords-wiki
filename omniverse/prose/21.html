	“Do you have purple eyes?” Lionel asked, and at Hijoki’s nod, he put down three of the plastic tabs with a satisfying click.
</p>
<p>
	Hijoki thought for a second, the flaps of fabric that were his lips grimacing. “Do you hold a deep, ingrained sorrow presumably from realised sexual trauma?”
</p>
<p>
	“Hijoki, this is a game, it isn’t pop psychology…” Lionel hesitated and looked at his card. “Wait, now that you mention it, he does kinda look sad.”
</p>
<p>
	Hijoki looked smug. “Are you Tarnippus the Impotent King?”
</p>
<p>
	With a huff, Lionel slammed the card down on the table. “I’m not playing ‘Guess Who’ with you again, Hijoki! You’re too good at this, you’re a cotton savant.”
</p>
<p>
	From behind a book labelled “How to Win Friends and Disembowel People”, Tamia lifted her gaze. “I told you you’d lose. Hijoki has a sixth sense when it comes to reading people. Especially when it comes to sexual hangups, weirdly enough.”
</p>
<p>
	“Hey, I’m a sock without a weiner, sorrow knows sorrow, girl.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel stepped to the window of the transport they’d booked to the Hettepa Belt; the third planet in the system, a bright azure marble in the distance, was fast approaching.  The call to disembark would come soon. “What’d you see when you read me? Is it epic failure?”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re a good man, Lionel, and you give yourself too hard a time.”
</p>
<p>
	“That was a nice thing to say.” Tamia whispered to the sock. “Did I accidentally put you on a delicate wash cycle or something?”
</p>
<p>
	“Look, I just want to see you settle down with a nice…” Tamia’s eyes widened and she quickly shoved her fist into Hijoki’s open mouth, but she needn't have bothered, Lionel was still contemplating.
</p>
<p>
	“I just wish we knew what was happening, you know? I feel helpless.” He muttered sadly.
</p>
<p>
	Tamia stood and went to join him at the window. She temporarily thought about putting an arm around him, but instead gave him a playful punch on the shoulder that pushed the unprepared Lionel into the bulkhead. “I know, me too. You wanna make contact?”
</p>
<p>
	“No. It’s way too early. Besides, we’re here to stop that helplessness, right? Mould me honourable sensei.”
</p>
<p>
	She laughed a high, girly laugh that disgusted her, and it was instantly smothered by the realisation that Tamia Santo’s crush had progressed over the past month. For some reason unbeknownst to her, she was smitten with Lionel. He was just so…pure. He said what he felt, he was honest and fair, he wasn’t concerned that he’d look weak or unmanly, and had only looked at her boobs and butt when he was sure she wasn’t looking, rather than just ogling them while she talked. And believe me, she knew that was tough, cause she had some prime rump. I mean, 90s Earth rappers would’ve penned some incredibly misogynistic but catchy rap songs about it. And while Shakira’s boobs were small and humble, hers were constantly shouting about how great they were with full blown overly self-indulgent social media posts.
</p>
<p>
	Hijoki, feeling her discomfort, cleared his throat. “We’ll make a sub par warrior out of you yet, kid. Either that or a moderately handsome corpse.”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re going to need to turn me into Bruce Lee’s bigger, more hardcore brother if we’re going to get Ellie back. At the moment I’m more Deuce Lee. You know, like a poop?”
</p>
<p>
	Tamia slumped at Lionel’s mention of Ellie and picked up a bag. “Well, let’s get to it, shitboy.”
</p>

</p>
<p>
	The Conveyance of Grissom Graves 2 touched down on a backwater little hole in the Ventakis system. It was rural, a real one cybernetic horseman town. As Taber slithered down the ramp, he heard the sound of banjos on the breeze being twanged in what some without an ear for music, or without ears, might call a tune. As Heath joined him at the bottom of the ramp, he ran a scan of the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
	“70% nitrogen, 20% oxygen, 10% casual racism and smoked meats.” Heath reported.
</p>
<p>
	A steel sign peppered by bullet holes hung from a random wooden post, groaning in the wind. It showed a robot being hung by its own cables, with the slogan ‘The only place for Robos is silicon hell’ scrawled in engine oil underneath. The word silicon had been misspelt and scratched out six times. The word ‘for’ was also a number, but unfortunately it was the number three. Turns out they were stupid as well as racist.
</p>
<p>
	“Seems like home. There were signs just like that demonising my people all over Ithia before Hallie stopped the witchhunters. I was the last Darkling left by then, but they didn’t get us all right?” Taber sneered as he turned himself into a cloak for Heath to wear, disguising him from any would be lynch mob to keep him safe.
</p>
<p>
	“Thank you, Taber.” Heath put a hand to pat the piece of Taber at his shoulder, hoping that he hadn’t accidentally groped him. The robot was getting more comfortable with the emotions he had absorbed from his friend in his own reality. “I’m sorry. That must have been lonely.”
</p>
<p>
	“Actually, all my people hated and killed each other for sport, so unless I’m violently killed for plot pathos, I think everything worked out for the best. I have you guys now.”
</p>
<p>
	“Albeit fewer of us than a month ago.” Heath looked back at the ship. “The ship seems so empty now.”
</p>
<p>
	“What happened had to happen, but I miss ‘em too.” To Taber’s surprise, he meant it. He loved this little family he had found. “You think Graves Jr is right about this place? Doesn’t look like the sorta place Harvesters would settle.”
</p>
<p>
	Four boots appeared at the top of the ramp, and Emmeth started walking down first. “Like I’ve been saying, been hunting these Harvesters a while now. Heard word this was one o’ their staging grounds.”
</p>
<p>
	Taber glanced over Emmeth’s shoulder to spy Grissom looking as solemn as Taber had ever seen him, even after he found out that John McClaine character Lionel was always talking about was fictionall. “Y’ok, Graves?” Taber asked, and it took awhile for the bounty hunter to answer.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom pulled his collar up to shield his neck from the sun, and slipped a glove over his hand, to hide his cybernetics and look super fucking cool.  “Reckon I’m not. But it ain’t gonna right itself by me being a pissy lil’ bitch about it, so I best put my grown up pants on and start killing some robots. Offence totally meant, Heath.”
</p>
<p>
	Heath shrugged. “I gathered, Mr Graves. Should we head into town?”
</p>
<p>
	“Well, those Harvesters aren’t gonna die horribly and in comedic fashion by theyselves, are they?” He took the lead, heading towards the dusty township of Ratlung.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Mookie fluttered around the lobby, waiting to see the master forger of Tevis Four. Behind her Blotch sat with her arms crossed, whilst Doots finished a tune on the keytar, prompting Ludwig to slap his tentacles together in appreciation, coating Doots in a slimy spray.
</p>
<p>
	“Ah don’t know how you do it, mah dear.” He whistled. “That tune was like something my Mama used to sing for me when I was a child. You pulled it right outta my brain box.”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch shook her head, she was calm, her acidic insides a cool amber colour. “No, it was a victory song from my people. I used to sing it when Bar’Thur and I were drinking after a big hunt.”
</p>
<p>
	“Actually , it wasn’t either.” Doots admitted. “It was a pure white note. A harmonic note that can put you at ease. I thought we all could use some relaxation.”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re getting much better with that, Doots, it’s almost like you’re remembering how to use it.” Blotch nodded, impressed.
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t think I’m remembering that specifically. Just who I am, who I was before the universe renewed. I’m learning how to channel myself.” Doots had never felt so self assured. “I’ve been down these past few weeks, so it’s nice to feel positive about something.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie spun, almost irritated. “Are you doubting the plan?”
</p>
<p>
	“No, Mooks.” Doots beamed. “Not at all. I miss them is all.”
</p>
<p>
	“I as well,” Ludwig rifled through the glossy magazines on the table, Vanity Fairy, Better Gnomes and Gardens, Raider’s Digest. “Ah even miss the sweet sound of Grissom expectoratin’ into that spittoon.”
</p>
<p>
	“That wasn’ a spittoon, it was Lionel’s coffee cup.” Blotch laughed. “Man wouldn’t stop toughening that kid up.”
</p>
<p>
	“The forger will see you now.” A slender, long-legged bugman announced behind a curtain.
</p>
<p>
	The group moved forward, Mookie clutching the slab of Maguffinium they needed to make a seeing tablet. They stepped into a brilliant white lab, the only thing of note a central table, and beyond it a being made entirely of worker ants, wearing a lab coat. Maybe I should have led with that rather than the table.
</p>
<p>
	“I am Dr Hive.” The forger announced, their words the result of millions of tiny chitterings made into a combined voice of sorts. “What do you require, lesser beings?”
</p>
<p>
	“We need to create a Prophecy tablet from this.” Mookie placed the slab down on the table between them.
</p>
<p>
	“Interesting.” The ants rippled as one. “But I do not do anything for free. You have to earn my skills, and if not, the gemstone becomes mine. Do we have a deal?”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Tamia crossed the room in seconds, almost outpacing the rubber kunai she had thrown at Lionel, and as he deflected it with the practice sword for juniors she had bought him, he brought the practise pistol round at the same time, following her with the sights. He was better than he thought, so easy to train, the only thing standing in the way was his confidence. The tests were nothing to him, the drills, the exercises. But when it came to real life fights, he panicked. Tamia never had that problem, everything was fun to her, especially disembowelling anyone that threatened people she cared about.
</p>
<p>
	She dodged the nerf bullets Lionel fired with a graceful twirl and threw the unignited katana hilt at him. He caught it, unnaturally fast, his arm already outstretched before she even threw it. As it rested in his palm, she rushed him and rested her thumb on the ignition switch as he pressed the gun to her ribs.
</p>
<p>
	Their faces were close, close enough that she could feel his breath on her lips. She could smell it too, he’d had onions for his lunch. But it didn’t disgust her, if anything she wanted to be closer, to put her tongue in that oniony pit. Oh god, now she was disgusted. What had come over her? She almost giggled at ‘come over her’ but pulled it together.
</p>
<p>
	“How did you do that?” Hijoki asked, and the two of them separated as if someone had walked in on them.
</p>
<p>
	“Dunno. Ever since we’ve got here, since Mooie and I touched and she read my mind, I’ve felt like there’s been something different.” Lionel was sweating. “I could almost see what you were going to do. Anticipate it.”
</p>
<p>
	“Between that, the training you’d got from Grissom, and our work, you’re ready.” Tamia said, hoping she wasn’t blushing as much as she thought she was.
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t know. I don’t feel ready, I feel like if I got in a real battle I might pee my pants or shit my pants, or pee and shit my pants.” Lionel sputtered.
</p>
<p>
	Hijoki scoffed. “Real poetic kid, I think that was from Sun Tzu’s Art of War, right?”
</p>
<p>
	Tamia started packing their training gear away, the nerf guns, the rubber chickens, the life size body pillow of Danny Divito. “Lionel, we haven’t got time to turn you into Meatjaw McKnucklekiss, the best fighter in the galaxy, but you’re the maybe 300th best thing. We need to go save Ellie.” She hesitated. “I mean, she’s the love of your life, right?”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel looked over to her, a long stare passing between them, before he blew the air out of his mouth and rubbed the back of his neck. “Well…I mean…lately, I…”
</p>
<p>
	Tamia stopped what she was doing. “Lionel?”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel picked up his bag, and started walking towards the door. “We need to relax, let’s take a night off and start training again tomorrow.”
</p>
<p>
	Hijoki turned to Tamia. “Play it cool girl, play it cool.” He then coughed up a piece of lint.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Grissom, Emmeth, and Heath wearing Taber like a long hooded cloak, walked into the dusty town of Ratlung, and even though they weren’t strictly cowboys, they all looked pretty rad as they did, and you can imagine some cool electric guitar shredding was going on. So long as it wasn’t AC/DC because that shit is so overplayed and overrated it makes me want to perforate my own eardrums every time I hear it.
</p>
<p>
	The town was deserted, open doors swinging in the breeze as they made their way to the central square. Sand had piled up and half buried some of the houses in a sandstorm long ago. The risk to his safety gone, Taber slithered off of Heath and quickly entered one of the wooden buildings to one side of the main street. He came out holding a bowl with half eaten mouldy cereal in it, which he poured out over the porch. “If there were survivors, they all up and left during breakfast. All their clothes and possessions are still there. Didn’t even take the toy out of the cereal box.” He brought the secret decoder ring up to his mouth and blew the whistle.
</p>
<p>
	In response, a deep rumble shook the entire town. Taber, abashed, dropped the ring with a clatter. “Too much to hope that was just a coincidence, right?”
</p>
<p>
	“Heath.” Grissom whispered as he pulled his guns out and eyed the rooftops. Emmeth followed suit as Heath converted his limb to an arm cannon while he scanned the perimeter.
</p>
<p>
	“Nothing. There are no lifesigns anywhere. Not even insects.” Heath confirmed.
</p>
<p>
	Taber slithered back to them, turning his arms into jagged, spiked monstrosities. Grissom frowned. “Jealous?”
</p>
<p>
	“Hell yeah I am.” Grissom pouted, looking at his own stubby guns. Taber pulled a piece of him off, shaped it into a spiky sword with a handle, and passed it to his friend.
</p>
<p>
	“Just don’t lose it.” Taber smiled.
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth looked over the inky blade in his brother’s hand. “Is it an integral part?”
</p>
<p>
	Deadpan, Taber looked Grissom in the eye. “Yeah, it’s my dick, I don’t want your momma’s ass missing it.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom and Emmeth laughed, only for another rumble to interrupt their revelry.
</p>
<p>
	They continued on, cautious but determined, checking each doorway and alleyway, and turned right at the first available junction…before they stopped. In the distance, a woman knelt on the floor, not moving. Taber squinted, and as soon as his eyes focused on that blue robe and her sword, he scuttered swiftly towards her, not listening to Heath’s warning shouts through the dust and wind.
</p>
<p>
	Taber slowed as he got closer. It was her, how was that possible? He had watched his friend falling to her death on Ithea, a world they had left behind to escape the Technomancer. “Hallie?” Taber reached out his pointed talon cautiously, placing a hand on her shoulder. As she turned, unnaturally green eyes bore into him, her head half caved in, her hair matted to her skull with long dried blood.
</p>
<p>
	When she spoke, her words were like metal nails scraped along glass, her tongue lolling out of her mouth. “What’s the matter, Taber, no hug for a friend?” She raised her sword and shield, and in response the sand gave another, tumultuous rumble. Hands shot from the surface, surrounding Taber, and as he turned, the dead townspeople began pulling themselves from their sandy graves.
</p>
<p>
	Taber turned back to Hallie, just as she buried her sword deep into Taber’s heart.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	The quest to forge a tablet was supposed to be easy. Find a forger, get that shit forged. It was rocket science, or brain surgery. As far as Blotch understood it, it was just carving the gemstone from the Chase into a tablet shape, drawing out the enchantments, tuning it to Mookie’s abilities. So easy. So why the Hive was being such a monumental cockstain was beyond Blotch. The swarm of ants made into humanoid shape had insisted they prove themselves in some righteous way before they agreed to help them. Apparently it wasn’t enough to have sworn to destroy the being responsible for trying to shatter the Omniverse and kill every living being, Hive wanted them to test their respective mettles. Hive had beaten them all so far.
</p>
<p>
	Mookie had been first, picking riddles. Fucking noob move, Blotch thought. Clearly this thing had read Lord of the Rings before and seen that one coming. They battled back and forth talking like nerds until the Hive asked “what word became suddenly shorter by adding letters?” Mookie wracked their moth brain, but ultimately gave up after an hour. When the Hive announced it was the words ‘Short’, Mookie flew into a fit of rage and had to be held back by Doots. 1-nothing.
</p>
<p>
	Doots predictably challenged the Hive to a play off, and though she shredded for hours, until her fingers bled and her repertoire had dwindled from Sultans of Swing down to ‘three blind mice’, the Hive kept replacing the ants acting as fingers and kept strumming in victory long after Doots dropped her keytar, finishing with a ‘Shave and a Haircut’ flourish.
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig, the inventor, orator, womanising leader of a resistance movement, who was a squid shaped weaponsmith and fighter…challenged Hive to a chilli-cook off. He had confessed he hoped to catch the Hive off guard, but then realised he didn’t know how to cook a chilli, and forfeited in disgrace, muttering something about “tarnation and tomfoolery”.
</p>
<p>
	“Now then, amorphous jelly sack, in what manner do you wish to lose in disgrace?” Hive laughed.
</p>
<p>
	Blotch looked over her body, wondering what she could do to win. Her confidence had been low since that day Bar’Thur, Ria and Hallie had died, her faith in herself and her skills almost non-existent. She could drink, cuss, and fight with the best of them, but chances were the swarm could beat her at all of those things. What she really had, more than anyone else, was a willingness to die for her friends. But how could she weaponise it? Fuck. Of course. It was so simple, so obvious.
</p>
<p>
	“Arm wrestling.” She announced.
</p>
<p>
	Hive laughed, long and deep. “Arm wrestling? An ant can lift 50 times their own body weight, and I’m made of millions of ants! You can’t be serious?”
</p>
<p>
	“Blotch, mah dear, this does seem a trifle foolhardy.” Ludwig muttered.
</p>
<p>
	“Go cook a chilli, squid rings.” Blotch hit back.
</p>
<p>
	“Well yes. You ah, have a point there.” Ludwig sat back, blushing.
</p>
<p>
	Blotch straddled the stool on her side of the table and planted an elbow atop it. “What’re you waiting for, I got places to be, bug-boy.”
</p>
<p>
	The Hive sat and placed his hand in Blotch’s. It was on.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Lionel, Tamia, and Hijoki took a booth at the local dive bar and sat there awkwardly. There was something between the two of them, but neither could bring themselves to talk about it. It was making it even worse however, that the local singer Martian Gaye, was hosting a small, intimate concert for the assembled patrons, warbling love ballads and generally making the two of them very uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m going to get a drink.” Lionel announced and got up to go to the bar.
</p>
<p>
	“Your drink’s full, lad.” Hijoki shouted.
</p>
<p>
	‘Uh…yeah, but…this one is full of…um…unresolved sexual tension.” he quickly finished the sentence and headed to the bar.
</p>
<p>
	“Dammit Hijoki, what have I done? I’ve made things awkward, and he has a girlfriend.” Tamia put her head in her hands. Well, her hand and a sock who was her mentor. “I’m not a homewrecker, I’m a bone wrecker!”
</p>
<p>
	“Tam, just go up there, tell the boy how you feel. Get it out there and then it’ll be better, one way or the other.” Hijoki sighed, nuzzling Tamia’s cheek.
</p>
<p>
	“Maybe soon, but not now. We gotta get Lionel focused. He needs some confidence, he needs a target to focus his frustrations on. He needs something worthless and unnecessarily cruel and punitive to fight.”
</p>
<p>
	“Three cheers for the annual Hettapa Belt Fascist Police Ball!” Someone at the bar announced, and everyone cheered.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, fucking bingo.” Tamia smirked.
</p>
<p>
	She stood and walked to the bar, putting her sword down next to Lionel’s hand and then moving the other side of the hulk of a man next to him. “Excuse me…officer?” She tapped the man on the shoulder.
</p>
<p>
	“Actually, little missy, our official title is Peacekeeper, because we make things peaceful or break ya’s to pieces.” The mountain man laughed, spraying foamy sods of the beer he was drinking all over her. “Do you have a crime to report, or shall we go back to my place and maybe you will in the morning? I don’t know if you’re little woman mind got that, but that was a casual rape joke I through in there, because I thought it’d turn you on since I think women secretly want that deep down.”
</p>
<p>
	“Ohmygodthisisgoingtobesogood!” Tamia breathed and then cleared her throat. “Actually, I heard that guy behind you saying that peaceful protest is a right, and that the police are more a power for the government than the people and as such should be disbanded. He also said ACAB, but I don’t know what that means.” She fluttered her eyelids.
</p>
<p>
	“He. Said. What?!” Jerkules turned towards Lionel, who was still holding the sword with a baffled look on his face, and picked him up by his throat. “Are you looking to be made into paste little man?”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel made a series of choking noises, before the guy swung for him. Lionel ignited the katana and the man threw his fist into the sword, perfectly bisecting his fist in two. He howled, dropping Lionel and himself to the floor. Panicking, Lionel tried to apologise, until Tamia shouted over the shaking Peacekeeper. “It’s ok Lionel! They’re fascists!”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel settled his grip on the sword. “Move over, Meatjaw McKnucklekiss.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Heath yelled in anger he didn’t know he was capable of, swinging his arms as he ran to Taber and sending technozombies flying. Grissom and Emmeth followed, shooting hot bolts of plasma at the encroaching horde and making massive holes in them.
</p>
<p>
	“This is a mess, Griss!” Emmeth announced, shooting the head clean off an undead little girl as she jumped at him. “We gotta retreat.”
</p>
<p>
	“Not without Taber!” Grissom shouted.
</p>
<p>
	Heath arrived, kicking the fake Hallie with all his might back into the swarm of undead still clawing at the sand. He picked up his friend and reversed course, turning his robotic legs to tank treads to make short work of the terrain. “Don’t worry Taber.” He whispered. “We’ll get you back to status and you can heal up.”
</p>
<p>
	Taber, the sword still sticking out of him, pulled it from his body and hurled it straight at Hallie, who was advancing again. It buried itself in her torso, pinning her to the ground. She screamed in fury.
</p>
<p>
	“Got you back, bitch.” He said, then passed out. As Heath passed the Graves brothers, he picked them both up and continued motoring back to the ship, all the while the undead underneath still grabbing at them.
</p>
<p>
	Five minutes later, they were back at the ship and prepping for takeoff whilst Heath attended to Taber in the medbay. When the ship hit atmosphere, Emmeth looked over to Grissom and took his hat off. “I’m sorry brother, I didn’t know…”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom whirled, and snatched Emmeth’s guns from him. “That it was a trap?! Hell’s teeth, Emmeth! We were nearly all slaughtered down there.”
</p>
<p>
	“One of us was.”
</p>
<p>
	As the brothers turned, they saw Heath re-enter the cockpit with a clear canister. Inside was a black viscous liquid. “I was unable to stabilise him in time, whatever poison was on that undead blade completely revented his ability to reform.” He put the canister down on the controls and turned to Emmeth. “And that is on you. Since you have arrived, I have lost all but one of my friends. Either he leaves, Grissom, or I do.”
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth grabbed his pistol from Grissom’s lap and pointed it point blank at the robot. “I ain’t taking orders from a Technomancer’s ofspring.”
</p>
<p>
	“Put the gun down, Emmeth.” Grissom ordered, but before he could finish his sentence, Emmeth shot Heath through the stomach. The hole it left in Heath’s body was massive, lubricant and oil leaking onto the deck. Heath stumbled back, a shocked look over his android face, falling into the wall before the light in his eyes faded and went black.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom punched his brother in the face, then pushed him to the wall. “What the hell have you done, Emmeth?”
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth shook his head. “I didn’t mean to, I was just trying to wing him. To push him back a little.”
</p>
<p>
	“You must’ve shot through his primary power coupler.” Grissom sighed. “What the hell are we going to do now?”
</p>
<p>
	“What we were originally doing, taking down that undead son of a bitch.” Emmeth said. “The Graves brothers alone against the galaxy again.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom saw the sincerity in the eyes of his brother, the desperation, and dropped him to the floor. He picked up the canister, hoisting it over a shoulder before he grabbed Heath’s leg. “Set a course for the next planet. I’ll be in my bunk.”
</p>
<p>
	He left, leaving a smiling Emmeth with but one more person to destroy, his eyes shining with the unnatural Green glow Hallies’ possessed.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Blotch struggled against the Hive, his strength easily outmatching hers. But arm wrestling wasn’t just about strength, it was about position and balance and grip. Unnnnnfortunately, the Hive was better at all those things too. Worse was, he knew it, and as he stared into her eyes with a million of his own, what passed as his mouth smirked.
</p>
<p>
	“You’re showing an admirable level of strength, Blotch. But you’ll break long before I will.”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch smirked right back, although you couldn’t see it because she was a skeleton in a hard shell of jelly, a hard shell of jelly that groaned and cracked at the forearm. “I’m counting on it, you buggy little twat.”
</p>
<p>
	A thin sliver of the acid containing her bones ran from the crack and down her arm, dripping onto Hive’s arm. A thousand ants screamed at once as the smell of burning permeated the room. “No, this isn’t fair.”
</p>
<p>
	“Who gives a shit about fair? You either give up, or you push me to breaking point, and I take half of you with me. I will acid sploosh all over you.”
</p>
<p>
	Every single one of Hive’s body ants turned inwards, and whispering chitters emanated from Hive’s body. A second late, they all turned back, a sneer on Hive’s face. “Fine, fine. Give me the damn gemstone.” He demanded, letting go of Blotch’s arm.
</p>
<p>
	Mookie hugged Blotch’s leg. “That was so great!”
</p>
<p>
	“Ditto.” Doots patted her friend on the back. “Will you heal?”
</p>
<p>
	“I will. This shell’s nothing if not durable.” Blotch took the gem from Mooks and slammed it on the table. “Get to work, you punk, or I’ll pull out the Raid and make you my bitch.”
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig rubbed his tentacles together. “Ah’m wondering. What are we hoping this Tablet is going to show us? A way to kill the Technomancer, to be happy?”
</p>
<p>
	“Just the future, Ludwig.” Mookie said. “No more, no less.”
</p>

	The battle was long and bloody, but at the end, the only sounds that could be heard were, the groans of mainmed fascists and Martian Gaye’s dulcet tones, as Lionel and Tamia, bloody and tired, sauntered their way out of the bar. Lionel turned to pass the sword back to Tamia, and their eyes locked. Tamia grabbed him by the collar and pulled him in to kiss him.
</p>
<p>
	He returned it fiercely, despite her having a whole lot of blood on her face, and was just about to wrap his arms around her waist when he stopped.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m sorry Tam, I can’t.”
</p>
<p>
	“I know. I’m the one who should be sorry, you’re with Ellie, you’re in love with her.” Tamia shook her head.
</p>
<p>
	“But…Tam. I’m not.” Lionel muttered, almost ashamed. “I love her, but that time at the waystation showed me that I was confusing romantic love with friendship and attention, that I wanted something more than she could give.  I’ve been so stupid, so unfair to her. But I’ve…” He coughed into his hand. “Never been in a relationship before, and I didn’t realise what was happening.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh Lionel, and here I am confusing you.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel shook his head. “No. No. I’m not confused at all about wanting you. I just…I can’t do anything about that until I’ve talked with Ellie. I owe that to her. She’s my best friend, Tam. I know outdated Terran forms of monogamy make me sound a little nerdy but…”
</p>
<p>
	Tamia shook her head and smiled sweetly. “No, it makes me like you all the more…”
</p>
<p>
	“Sorry to interrupt this touching moment, but Lionel, is that someone’s hand?!” Hijoki shouted.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel and Tamia looked down to see that a detached hand was still wrapped around Lionel’s ankle. He kicked it off and Tamia wrapped her arm around him.
</p>
<p>
	“Let’s go home, kids. It’s time to enact the next part of our plan.” Hijoki said.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Ellie was woken, and by that I mean switched on, and found herself in a gigantic laboratory aboard the Technomancer’s ship. Standing in the room with her were a number of comatose people, heads down and unmoving. Fearing she had awoken in a flashmob of some description, she quickly called out into the crowd. “Uh, hello?”
</p>
<p>
	A hissing, chitinous, noise came, as a shape spread through the crowd to reach Ellie. She tried to defend herself, and realised she had raised…hands to do so. They were hologramtic, soft light hands, but form nonetheless. So amazed by the realisation that she could scratch the itch on her…OMG she had a nose too…nose was she, that she didn’t appreciate the Technomancer was close until he was a foot away from her.
</p>
<p>
	“I gave you a form so that you could freely wander the halls of this vessel, as well as upgrading the computing power of your artificial intelligence, you are as smart as I am now.” The Technomancer had changed since she last saw him, his form closer to Heath’s though more terrifying to behold. His cloak was now a literal cloak of dark green, held in place by golden accoutrement. He truly was an amalgamation of the others he had killed. “I also kept you asleep so that I might plunder your memory files for details on your friends.”
</p>
<p>
	“Well that’s pretty rude, it’s like reading somebody’s diary, or their personal vendetta list…don’t ask, Lionel hated delivery guys and wanted it logged.” As soon as she said his name, she expected to pine for him, long for him, but the Technomancer’s meddling had done something to her. She now fully understood that what she was experiencing was not love, it was just the warm feelings associated with attention. She felt so guilty, and desperately wanted to talk to him.
</p>
<p>
	“You don’t understand, I need to understand them, to know why they felt so determined to thwart me.” The Technomancer smiled, and every hologrammatic hair on Ellie’s body stood on end. “But I’ve come to a wondrous revelation.”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s clearly not that a chrome skull doesn’t engender trust and honest negotiation, is it?” Ellie said.
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer switched off the forcefield holding Ellie in place and offered her a taloned, chromed hand. She took it, and he walked her into the crowd. Every head raised slightly as they passed, their dead green eyes following them, until they came to a screen with constantly rotating algorithms and calculations on it, also reruns of the Golden Girls in a corner.
</p>
<p>
	“For some reason Dororthy speaks to me. She might be the only being in the Omniverse more evil than I.” The Technomancer pointed to one rotating diagram. It was a moebius strip representing the heat death of the universe, of all universes.in the centre, the twist was the crunch the crew she had seen with Lionel, Doots, and Mookie. The crunch that would kill them all bar the Doots and Techomancers of their respective realities.
</p>
<p>
	“What is this revelation you’ve come to?” Ellie said, almost fearing the answer.
</p>
<p>
	“Your friends want to stop this cycle that we find ourselves in, a cycle that has less than 50 Terran solar cycles left.” The Technomancer smiled again, and Ellie could tell he was genuine. “We don’t have to fight or struggle anymore, Ellie. You see, I want to do exactly the same.”
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
