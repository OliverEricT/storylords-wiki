<p>
	“Mookie! Mookie!” A voice boomed down the cold black glass corridors, reverberating off each wall until the reproach felt tenfold. “Hive help you if you are touching those braziers again! You can bandage your own burns this time.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie pulled fingers from the flame and brushed them down their brown acolyte robes. Beautiful fire, Mookie thought, why do they even have braziers in the enclave of the  Mothman Prophesiers, especially when the whole planet had electricity? Mookie was drawn to it, like a moth to a…ah, Mookie just got that reference. Resisting the urge to smooch the fire tenderly, Mookie scuttered down the mirrored corridors of the central databank in little hops, weak wings fluttering, knowing that there was no point in hiding from Death’s Head. Like all senior seers of the clan, Death’s Head could easily see Mookie’s intentions if she wanted to.
</p>
<p>
	Mookie passed the electronic tablets embedded in the walls, each one of them a Prophesiers’ vision of the future, unlike the regular fortune reading work of the enclave. Most prophecies were obvious, predicting things like the inevitable fall of capitalism or the few thousand douchebag Rotten Tomatoes reviews for female-led television productions. But those in the central databank were vague, there was no understanding them, these visions were meant for someone higher, someone more worthy than little Mookie, who couldn’t even read tea leaves yet. In a place where people much bigger than Mookie rushed around and opened doors without looking who was behind them first, a lack of foresight meant a lot of squished mandibles for poor, old Mookie.
</p>
<p>
	“You know you shouldn’t be down in the databanks, little one.” Death’s Head stood with a soft smile and her arms across her chest, the skull patterning on her face making her look far more terrifying than she was - not that anyone but Mookie saw that side of her. She was beautiful and tall (I mean, if you were a bug, you’d let her bite your clean head off for the chance to get that sweet bug action), her slender carapice envied by most of the clan’s members. “There are prophecies down there that aren’t for the eyes of us, but for the one who will see all, our hallowed Omniseer.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie noticed the bitter tone in her voice, and had often heard her arguing with Father Flicker about their application of the old rules. She opposed keeping the electronic tablets hidden, waiting for a day that might never come. But Flicker was an old man and a fool, so out of touch with the present political state of the planet Ithea. He actually opposed newly appointed General Hallie Swiftfeather’s rebellion after she took down the Dankpit Dwarves with that giant stone golem. Swiftfeather had unified the righteous against those that had fought to strip Ithea of all hope, prosperity, and beautiful open flame…damn, not open flame, freedom that was it, freedom. Everyone was behind Swiftfeather: The Elves, the remaining Dwarves, the Humans, Swampers, the Goblins and the Joblins (Goblins with jobs), the bloods, the crips, the jellymen, the skelemen, the jellyskelemen, Dave, Dave the younger, the gnomes, Dave the youngest. Everyone. But Flicker was one of those that couldn’t understand why youngsters had it hard, because he had his own wood pile at the age of 18, even though Ithean coin bought a lot more back then; there was no changing his mind.
</p>
<p>
	“Sorry, Death’s Head.” Mookie muttered, twitching their fluffy antennae. “What did you want to see me about?”
</p>
<p>
	The tall Mothwoman crouched down and put a leg to Mookie’s shoulder. “Ascension Day is here again, Mookie.”
</p>
<p>
	A panic set on the youngster and their heart rate jumped rapidly. The Ascension Day involved Moth Acolytes cocooning and taking their final form. Mookie hadn’t even considered a final form yet, not comfortable choosing a species or gender, they were currently more than happy with what they currently were. “But…what if this IS my final form, DH? Why can’t everyone just be content with what I am? Is it not enough?”
</p>
<p>
	Looking away, as if she were deeply ashamed, Death’s Head cleared her throat, then reached out with her long legs and pulled Mookie in to hug them tight. “I’ll lose the paperwork and defer the Ascension another year, but only if you promise to stay out of the databanks. Especially tonight.”
</p>
<p>
	At Mookie’s nod, Death’s Head released the hug and pushed Mookie towards the entrance hall. “Now go do your job, Acolyte, there’s not likely to be a patron this late in the evening, but we should keep the desk occupied nonetheless.”
</p>
<p>
	However, no sooner than her statement was finished, the front desk bell rung, and Mookie and Death’s Head ran to see who was banging the bell at this late hour. One of the other Acolyte Hatchlings must have left the bulbs and braziers on, because light flooded the entrance hall and rushed to meet them, becoming more intense as they got closer to the desk. As they entered the large black polished room, neither of them were prepared for what they would find there.
</p>
<p>
	A being of pure neon energy stood at the front desk, so bright that their edges could barely be made out. Whatever it was held a key-tar and was noodling away on it while they slammed the bell on the desk in a sort of rhythmic way, much like a Red Hot Chilli Peppers song. The keytar was long and slender, brilliantly white with rainbow keys, one side of the instrument sharpened to an axe-like edge. As Mookie blinked, their eyes adjusted and the burgundy velvet of a court bard’s uniform could be made out beneath the light.
</p>
<p>
	“Mookie,” Death’s Head whispered, shielding her eyes against the neon yellow glare. “Can you deal with this, please? I have work to do.”
</p>
<p>
	Before Mookie could protest, the slender seer had flown quickly away, back from whence they had come. Mookie was alone with the Bard, who had since begun beatboxing, but in a key never before heard, like a theremin and an accordion had got really drunk and really freaky. Stepping forward, Mookie was drawn to the being, and reached out unknowingly to touch them, before the bard suddenly darkened and became a more manageable golden hue.
</p>
<p>
	“Ah, that’s better, we’re alone now.” She said, putting a hand out. “Something felt off with the larger one. I had to get rid of her.”
</p>
<p>
	“That’s very rude!” Mookie looked the being up and down. “Death’s Head is a friend and you shouldn’t disrespect her.”
</p>
<p>
	After the bard noticed that Mookie hadn’t taken her hand, she grabbed Mookies’ front leg and forced a hearty handshake. “Her name is Death’s Head and you think she’s good, Mookie, was it? Interesting. I’m Doots Bardly, battlebard, rhyme-crimer, cunning-linguist, Dr of tune-nostromy, and general tunesmith to General Swiftfeather’s court.”
</p>
<p>
	“Death’s Head is her species, not…” Mookie sighed, irritated by this rude person. They drew their leg back and stared. “Tune-nostromy isn’t a valid field of study! And that name is awfully on the nose isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m a bit of a mystery, dontcha know? Came down in the big meteor storm in ‘86 and was found by the river. Must’ve hit my head or something, because when I was taken in by the guild I didn’t remember anything about my past, ya get me? I had to pick my own name, so I chose the one they mocked me with. So now I’m Rooting Tooting Doots Bardly, she/her. I wear this name badge to remember it, because I must’ve hit my head or something, I don’t  remember anything about my past, ya get me?” Doots spoke in one long sentence, a verbal diarrhoea of facts about herself that Mookie didn’t want to be covered in.
</p>
<p>
	“I heard. Is Rooting Tooting actually part of your name?”
</p>
<p>
	“No, I just think it sounds cool, Mookie.” Doots admitted with no hint of shame. Mookie concerned themselves with tidying the various tarot decks, crystal balls and tea leaves, hoping this patron would get to the point soon. “I’m looking for two specific prophecies, wait I wrote them down. One that might teach me how to cast haste so I can do my chores quicker.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie tiredly tried to explain that Doots' perception wouldn’t be changed if she cast haste, and it’d take the same amount of time to do the chores in her relative perspective, but Doots just steamrolled over the statement and continued. “I’m also looking for a prophecy that might reveal my place in the universe. Everyone seems to think they know who I am, you know, but how is that possible, when I don’t even know?”
</p>
<p>
	A deck of cards clattered to the floor as Mookie, who understood perfectly well what the girl was struggling with, was taken by surprise. Even for Mookie, who remembered their life and knew the person they were, the expectation levied at them was a pressure that made them feel like popping at times. “I don’t know if we can help you tonight. I’m only an Acolyte, I can’t read futures or pasts.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots seemed undeterred and jumped onto the desk, playing the Eddie Van Halen Eruption solo without breaking a sweat. “I don’t believe you can’t. There’s always talent there, just unearthed like a seed that might grow into a powerful stinky carrion plant.”
</p>
<p>
	“Gee, thanks.” Mookie uttered. “But I haven’t ever seen the sort of prophecy you’re looking for, even in the secret data…banks.”
</p>
<p>
	As Mookie watched Doots’ eyes widen and light up, they realised their mistake. Fingers went to grab at Doots, but only wafted at the Keytar, which made the noise of a finger sliding down the piano keys as Doots scooted down the counter and off the end. “C’mon, what’re you waiting for, Mookie? We got prophecies to find!”
</p>
<p>
	“No, wait! We can’t!” Mookie cried, chasing after the girl in burgundy . The light from Doots was fading and Mookie had to be quick, so they hopped along down the corridor, willing their underdeveloped wings to carry them, though they knew they couldn’t yet hold their weight. With a slam, their wings gave up and they fell in a heap to the cold mirrored floor. When Mookie looked up, the light had gone out, and they had lost Doots. The corridors of the databanks suddenly felt incredibly frigid, the evening air biting more than usual.
</p>
<p>
	“Hey, what’s this, Mooks?” The whisper came from Mookie’s right.
</p>
<p>
	Mookie scurried over to find Doots staring at a wall of electronic tablets, showing some of the newest visions from the enclave. They were as fragmented and hazy as always, but changing before their very eyes, clouding over and becoming new visions Mookie had never seen. In one a cyborg cowboy and a young human flew a ship through the heart of a collapsing planet. In another, a woman wielded a sock puppet and a glowing sword as they searched for something in a palace of glass, in another a man sat on the observation deck of a space station in a string vest going to town on a corn dog, like he was deep throating that thing - Mookie quickly brushed a hand in front of the tablet to dismiss that one - in another, Mookie and Doots hid from legions of undead electronic beings, the two of them huddled together, their hands clasped in a white knuckled embrace.
</p>
<p>
	The Bard gasped at the image. “I’ve never had a friend before. That looks nice.” As her voice lowered, her light levels dipped. Mookie stared at Doot’s body, where underneath the surface nebulas and constellations swirled and rotated, as if she contained a whole galaxy inside her. When Mookie looked hard enough, they could see themselves, but somehow different, older and glowing: a new Mookie. As the girl caught Mookie looking, she turned her lights up a little and smiled, embarrassed. “What is all this?”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s the central data-banks, the newest prophecies waiting to be read by the Omniseer.” They whispered.
</p>
<p>
	“Well, these aren’t being read. Do they normally change like that?”
</p>
<p>
	“Well it’s been a decade since our last Omniseer died. And no, they don’t.”
</p>
<p>
	As if they had heard Mookie, the tablets flashed and crackled, all of them suddenly showing a flash of an image before going dark. Mookie could swear they saw something awful, a metallic skull with curved ram horns, something that spoke to the deepest, darkest fears in their brain. Mookie turned instantly to ask Doots if she had seen it, but the girl’s open mouthed horror told Mookie she had. Before they could discuss it, the silence was broken by a horrifying chittinous whispering.
</p>
<p>
	“Come on.” Doots put her hand out, and to their surprise, Mookie took it. They moved quickly and silently through the corridors, drawn by the slopping clicking that grew louder with each step, like an old person with no dentures eating yogurt.
</p>
<p>
	They turned the corner to discover the source of the terror inducing noise, a mass in the corner of the room, shivering and convulsing. The form of a moth. “Seen, never unseen, seen, never unseen.” It ticked and whispered as Doot’s pointed silently to a gap on the wall where one of the electronic tablets should have been plugged into the prophecy wall.
</p>
<p>
	“Death’s Head?” Mookie muttered, reaching out a leg.
</p>
<p>
	The form lumbered to one side and turned, shaking legs barely able to support the mass of evil Death’s Head had become. One side of her face drooped, and thick viscous drool poured from her mandibles. Out of her temple, one large horn protruded from the broken skin that festered alongside her glazed over eyes. “She was so curious. About the future,  about me.” The voice was Death’s Head’s but not, an electronically modulated amalgamation that fizzed and hissed static. She held a tablet in her front legs, a prophecy of the ghostly, horned skull flickering on the screen. “But when you delve into me, I delve back. Now she, like so many others, is free. Where is Hallie Swiftfeather, small ones?”
</p>
<p>
	“We don’t know who you’re talking about,” Doots smiled, fearless. “Though the prophecies about dermatological care are the next aisle over, next to the ones on creepy skulls, things that smell like diuretic ducks assholes, and ghosts that don’t know when they’re dead.”
</p>
<p>
	A long, thick, black tongue flicked across Death’s Head’s mandibles to leave a thick layer of slime across her mouth. “I’m no ghost, child. No mere sad spirit. I am vengeance personified. Biological extermination in full form. Basically, I’m here to wreck your shit up.”
</p>
<p>
	Long tentacles of wire shot in coils from Death’s Head, and Mookie pushed Doots out of the way just in time to avoid being enveloped by them.
</p>
<p>
	Tears flooded Mookies saucer shaped eyes. “Death’s Head, if that’s you in there, please come home.”
</p>
<p>
	The electronic ghoul fissed a chuckle. “She is already home. Death is the finish line we all race towards. She felt such fury at the world, her place in it. I have used it to wrap her up, like a cozy blanket. Do not weep for her, everything she suffered with is now my sweet fuel, and everything else...” It smiled, teeth jagged and broken.
</p>
<p>
	Mookie watched as Doots got quickly to her feet and played an improvised staccato rhythm on the keys, producing discordant solid notes in the air, notes that looked like daggers.
</p>
<p>
	The young mothling somehow knew what to do, turned and beat their wings as hard as they could, producing a gust that propelled the daggers at the fiend. It howled in an ungodly pain as the sharps stuck in the thing's body. When the beast lifted its head, one of the sharps sat buried in its eye socket, burning puss bubbling from the wound and stripping the fur from Death Head’s face to reveal a metal skull underneath.
</p>
<p>
	It lumbered towards them, its tendrils grabbing at tablets and throwing them like missiles at the pair. Doots played the cha cha slide, and Mookie found themselves sliding to the left, sliding to the right, and criss crossing to avoid the projectiles that cracked against the far wall and brought part of the panelling down.
</p>
<p>
	Mookie picked up bits of the fractured panelling and skimmed them back at the beast, several of them hitting it square in the face. Once they’d run out, Mookie’s hand touched one of the prophecy tablets, and they were just about to chuck it when a tendril of plack punctured Doots in the shoulder, knocking her keytar to the floor.
</p>
<p>
	Both Doots and the thing that once was Deaths Head froze, caught in some sort of trance, eyes rolling back.
</p>
<p>
	“I know you.” Each said in unison. As Mookie rushed towards them, the Prophecy tablet in their hand glowed white, and suddenly Mookie was somewhere else.
</p>
<p>
	It was Ithea, but not. The cool mirrored floor of the databank lay beneath their feet, but the walls and roof were utterly destroyed, the room entirely exposed to the elements. The sky was a swirl of dark violet clouds, racked by winds that seemed to want to tear the very flesh from you. Lightning flashed against the wasteland ground, which was lined with dead Mothmen, Dwarves, Elves…every race known.
</p>
<p>
	The roaring of one of the Elven Spacechariots sounded overhead, and surged toward the horizon. It rocketed away from the planet to join a fleet of others - an evacuation fleet - leaving two figures on the horizon - one a tall cloaked figure with ram horns and metallic skull, and General Swiftfeather, on her knees in front, bleeding out from a gut wound. Mookie tried to call out, to run to the General, but all they could do was watch as the fiend ripped their leaders' head off as the world around them faded into nothing.
</p>
<p>
	With a blink Mookie was back, and the world they had been a part of for a fraction of a second danced in front of them on the tablet in fragments. A prophecy. Not only one that Mookie themselves had conjured up, but one they could read and experience - something only an Omniseer could do.
</p>
<p>
	Finding their courage, Mookie picked up the Keytar and held it above their head in one stride, and brought the sharp, axe-edge down through the tendrils. The evil that inhabited Deaths Head that Mookie had seen in the prophecy howled in pain, and Doots’ fell to the floor, regaining control of her body.
</p>
<p>
	“A Nexus, and an Omniseer together?” The beast spoke in static. “I will have you both for my own.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots stood, as confident a Nexus as Mookie had ever seen. I mean maybe, because they didn’t know what one of those was. “You can have this, Technomancer.” With that, she played a chord and threw the keytar in front of the Technomancer. The note continued, growing in reverb and loudness until it invaded all thought and action, the moth/technomancer rearing in agony to reveal her middle legs were still clutching a tablet close to her thorax. Doots pulled Mookie close to drown out the noise, as the sound became a high pitch that seemed to shake the very bones of them. The room went white hot, then quickly returned to normal.
</p>
<p>
	Dizzy, Mookie stood, only to see the flesh almost completely stripped from Death’s Head to reveal the being from the prophecy clearly, a terrifying visage of chrome and hate. The smell emanating from the husk was stomach-churning, like raw sewage and rot. They turned to Doots with a raised eyebrow.
</p>
<p>
	“Brown noise.” Doots smirked. “First note I ever learned to play. Always went down well at Bard camp.”
</p>
<p>
	A sick robotic chuckling came from the corner. “You…children. You believe me a villain, like some pantomime blackhat? Humanoid life is fleeting, inconsequential, a blink in a long, hard stare of the universe. As unimportant as a raindrop to the ocean.”
</p>
<p>
	“You’d rather we die?” Mookie demanded, trying not to think of the death of their beloved mentor and failing. They felt Doots’ fingers link with theirs. It was nice to have a friend.
</p>
<p>
	“Die?” The Technomancer seemed taken aback. “I only want Hallie Swiftfeather dead for her crimes. The rest of you I mean to make immortal, preserved, catalogued, always relevant, always current. Connected, never alone. No lies, no deception, everyone knowing the intention of the other, only love between them, only conformity.”
</p>
<p>
	“And what if we don’t want to conform?” Mookie raged, tired of this argument again, this justification of her entire existence. “What if we’re happy as we are?”
</p>
<p>
	“Nonsense, your lives are changing and subject to alteration as we speak. You are an Omniseer, the future is yours to read and influence. And she is a Nexus, a perfect point in space and time, a key to every reality, a door to every fabric of existence. By joining, we will shape the course of every history, every future, every life. And we will know all, be all.” The Technomancer lifted a tendril, an offer for them to take it, and Mookie felt Doots falter.
</p>
<p>
	Doots turned to Mookie, eyes wet. “He knows who I was, Mookie. Where I came from.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie squeezed Doots’ hand as tight as they could, as if to hold her to the spot. “I know who you ARE, and we’ve seen who you WILL be. The other stuff isn’t important to me.”
</p>
<p>
	Shaking them off, and slipping her fingers from Mookie, Doots took a few steps towards the Technomancer. She reached out a hand, but gave Mookie a knowing look. As the fiend stood to take Doots’ hand, she shifted and swung the axe in a high arc and brought it down on the creature's face. In return, the beast threw its tentacles at Doots, sending her across the room and convulsing in rage, revealing the Prophecy tablet again. Moots grabbed a shard of panelling, and flapped their wings to the point of breaking, crossing the room in a fraction of a second and smashing the tablet into bits with the edge of the fragment.
</p>
<p>
	The wraith doubled over as if run through, staying deathly still for two seconds before being slowly sucked into the tablet. The thick tendrils writhed and grabbed for anything to anchor them as the Technomancer was sloughing away from the rotting frame of Death's Head and into the pieces of broken technology.
</p>
<p>
	“You will regret spurning my offer.” It fizzed. “You will look over your shoulder every day, until the one I am there behind you. Each time you wake in the night you will wonder if it is my breath on your neck or just a cold breeze. And when you realise I am there, it will already be too late.”
</p>
<p>
	As he melted into the piece of tablet, the light went out of the room, and Mookie realised Doots was dull and dark. They ran over to rouse her, and as her light flickered back on she blinked her eyes open. “Thank the Omni…” Mookie stopped short of thanking themself, not used to their current status.
</p>
<p>
	“What the hell is going on here!”
</p>
<p>
	They both turned, to find the small green luna moth form of Father Flicker standing in the open alcove. He was hunched, with the general disapproving stare of the elderly once they have realised their time has passed. He was flanked by three of the other senior seers, Brindell, Flitch, and Svelda.
</p>
<p>
	“Take the Nexus to the infirmary. And prepare Death’s Heads’ body for disposal.” Flicker ordered, his eyes not moving from Mookie as the seers rushed in to pick Doots up. “And you. Come with me, Acolyte.”
</p>
<p>
	“But Father, we..”
</p>
<p>
	“Enough! Follow me.” Mookie picked up the keytar and followed in silence, climbing the corner staircase to flickers office. He unbolted the door, rushed Mookie inside, and bolted it behind him. “Acolyte, I…”
</p>
<p>
	“Father, it wasn’t Deaths Head anymore, it was something called the Technomancer!” They blurted out, unable to hold it and begging for his understanding.
</p>
<p>
	Flicker hobbled around his desk, and slumped into his chair, picking up a piece of cloth from his desk and biting off a big mouthful. “I know. The last Omniseer told me this would happen.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie stood with their mouth gaping open, clasping their hands together.
</p>
<p>
	“Ten years ago, when Omniseer Losa was dying, she told me of the rise of the vengeance of the electronic beast, and the fall of our planet. We tried everything we could this last decade, everything to reset the road. Even helping Swiftfeather take down the Dankpit Dwarves. But we seem to be hurtling down that tunnel towards the light at the end…” He went comatose for a second talking about life before shaking his head and realising where he was. “Now you will be the new Omniseer, just as was predicted. And we’ll develop a new strategy, whatever that may be. But your new friend is dangerous, and there’s something we need to do first. She cannot be allowed to remember what happened here today, she will cause chaos.”
</p>
<p>
	Confusion, total bafflement, took Mookie. Why? “No, I won’t let it…”
</p>
<p>
	“You are not Omniseer yet, child!” Flicker shouted, before settling himself back in his chair. “There is much left for you to learn. And one of those lessons is knowing when to act and when to take the time to interpret. You will be friends again, if it is meant to be. But not today.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie looked down at the keytar in their hand, a tear dropping to bounce off it. “Ok.” Mookie muttered. “But I must have a moment to prepare.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	“Like I was saying, we don’t have any of those sort of Prophecies here, Doots.” Mookie said, trying to hold their voice steady. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to lock up for the night.”
</p>
<p>
	The Bard looked taken aback, and stepped away from the counter. “OK, Mookie…I’ll er…I’m sorry my mind is a bit fuzzy, happens with this amnesia stuff. Maybe I’ll come back some other time.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’d like that.” Mookie almost smiled. And rushed Doots out the door before tears could give them away. “Goodnight now.”
</p>
<p>
	The breeze rushed against Doot’s face, but she didn’t feel it, she never felt the cold, nor the heat. There was something missing here, the hours had flown by in the enclave, but she only seemed to be there ten minutes, how had her memory become so fragmented?
</p>
<p>
	Shaking her head as if to free herself from the worries, Doots grabbed her keytar…only to feel some scratching on the back. She turned it, praying to whatever gods would listen that her single use in the universe hadn’t been extinguished. There on the white surface, just under the Surfin USA sticker was a message.
</p>
<p>
	“The Technomancer comes. Tell General Swiftfeather to ready for war. Love, your friend.”
</p>
<p>
	A small moth had been scratched under the message. Doots picked up the pace, she had a long walk ahead of her.
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
