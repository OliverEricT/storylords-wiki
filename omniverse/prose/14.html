<p>
	Prompts - Shields and Curses
</p>
<p>
	The kid stumbled in the mud in front of Hallie and ate dirt, fully face planting the ground. She was black robed and black dressed, like she’d just come from a My Alchemical Romance concert. Without breaking stride, the Wood Elf swooped the girl up in her arms and used her sword, “The Fucker-Upper”, to chop clean through one of the trees in her path. It collapsed behind her, taking some of the chittinous, robotic demons pursuing them down with it, crushing their guts up through their heads like gross tubes of toothpaste - 9 out of 10 dentists would not have recommended it.
</p>
<p>
	Hallie and her charge burst into the clearing, a vast, flat circle where there was no cover and nowhere for the two to hide. Perfect. This was it, where they’d fight. As the robotic monsters swarmed around them in the clearing, Hallie noticed that they were each composed of various different species - a clawed arm of a crustacean clan, the slick, hairless torso of a merman, the horse legs of a centaur (or maybe a horse, who could tell), the clapping buttcheeks of a redonkadonkula. Each part stitched together with the same black wires they had found around the countdown ‘tree’ at Gladecleft. They were monstrosities, disgusting abominations of the Technomancer that had been risen from the dead and revived by dark malice. Unthinking, unfeeling affronts to life that she’d happily put down. She shook her head, where had this rage come from? She had remained calm whilst her kin had been slaughtered by the Dankpit Dwarves, while she fought the Ithean wars once she’d joined the royal guard. She even had retained her composure when the Technomancer destroyed all the major cities of Ithea last month. She was - to all who knew her - cooler than a polar bear's testicles with a pair of aviator shades on. But recently she was fury - red hot, burning, don’t ticket me I’ve only been here for five minutes to drop something off, oh goddamn you, you’re ticketing me, why don’t you get a real job you jumped up Nazi, aggression personified.
</p>
<p>
	One of the creatures opened their mouth wide, but what came out wasn’t their voice, it was a chilling whisper that was somehow a hiss, quiet but somehow burning. “Give in, Swiftfeather. I have seen your slaughter at my hands. It is glorious.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallie sneered. “When I die I’ll be surrounded by comatose men, be it in bed or on the battlefield, it won’t be due to some tin can who thinks they’re a demon lord.” Suddenly she threw the young child at the lead cyberzombie, who recoiled at her apparent callousness (obvious he did not have children of his own). As the child flew through the air, it became a black wraith that abandoned human shape and enveloped the beast, tearing chunks off it until it was a quivering pile of machinery.
</p>
<p>
	The Darkling, Taber, took his humanoid form again, inky black arms stretching. “And they say kids are a burden.” (Editors note: Kids are indeed a burden. A horrible, life-sucking burden.)
</p>
<p>
	Bar’Thur and Blotch jumped down from the surrounding trees, Blotch dousing a few of the robots in her jellyskele acidic insides, as the force from her frogman friend’s cudgel demolished three more. Ria Grey, the human ranger, looked morose as she uncloaked behind one of the Technomancer’s zombies and slit the central fuel line in its neck, causing it to convulse and fall to the floor. Heath picked up the body with the strength expected from the son of an alternate reality Technomancer, and turned another few to dust. Doots played a lullabye that sent the other robots to sleep,  meaning that the diminutive Mookie could finish them off by running around and unplugging them.
</p>
<p>
	And quickly, they were alone in the clearing, all of them panting from the exhaustion of their ruse. Bar’Thur scratched at his neck, where his universal translator was buried just under the skin, his skin was dry and red and the scratching was unbearably loud.
</p>
<p>
	Ria gritted her teeth then turned to him. “Damn you, stop that incessant scratching! You’re getting frog flakes everywhere.”
</p>
<p>
	“Only if you stop that incessant whining, Grey.” Blotch stepped in as she always did, but this time it only made Bar’Thur angry. “I can fight my own battles, Blotch, especially against a sweaty Humie.”
</p>
<p>
	It had been like this for weeks. With no sleep, no comfort, no respite - just the guilt they all felt at falling for the Technomancer’s obvious ruse to draw them out months ago. Before the Nightmare Council was formed, they had been plagued by evil visions, but this was even worse. They were all so raw and exposed, like a nudist in a sandpaper factory. As Doots brought her hand down from rubbing her itchy neck, she sneered at her fellows. “You’re all so quick to knife each other the moment we are finished fighting, can we not all take a moment’s peace?”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie chimed in. “You could play something relaxing, it might help us…”
</p>
<p>
	Doots turned her gaze on her friend. “We don’t all solve our problems via mental manipulation, Mookie.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie looked ashamed before Taber railed against Doots. “And they call me dark. Maybe you should remember it’s forgive and forget, bard, not forgive and twist the knife.”
</p>
<p>
	All through this, the mechanical man, Heath, surveyed his new family and must have been wondering what he had let himself in for. At least he wasn’t fighting, Hallie sighed.
</p>
<p>
	“Enough.” the Wood Elf finally said. “I know we’re at the end of our patience.I know we’re being hunted. But our people need us. We have found and liberated thousands of survivors these last four months, all we have left is to check the Capital for survivors, then we join the refugees at the docks, board the longboats and get the hell out of dodge. After we take the Technomancer down of course.”
</p>
<p>
	The group fell silent, feeling the tide of shame when you are faced with the unkindnesses you have uttered, but also because of the mere mention of the Technomancer. They had voiced their reservations, the worries they couldn’t shake. It didn’t change their leader’s mind.
</p>
<p>
	“Did anyone see how good I looked in that black dress?” Taber whistled. “I nearly fell in love with myself.”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch chuckled. “You’re already in love with yourself Darkling, you just had a more reasonable excuse this time.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots placed her head on Mookie’s shoulder, and Mookie brought a wing around their friend.
</p>
<p>
	Heath crossed his legs and opened a compartment in his chest, bringing a bottle of sweet wine from a compartment within. “I found this in the Eleven settlement we saved three weeks ago. I was going to save it for when we…well…it seems more apropos now.”
</p>
<p>
	He tossed the bottle to Bar’thur, who uncapped it with his cudgel, then brought the label to his face. “Centaur’s Stagger Runeshine - every mouthful equals one bad decision. Well we gots plenty of those ‘tween us already.” He took a swig, then handed it to Blotch. She poured it onto her front and absorbed it, the wine swirling in her transparent jelly and dissolving. “I’ve tasted better chariot fuel, but it’ll do the job.”
</p>
<p>
	The bottle went round the group until emptied as they told stories. Taber told a tale of how he’d led a group of Darklings to victory against the Clan of Daves by pretending to be their shadows and infiltrating their camps. Ria told of hunting a whale by being swallowed and gradually cutting her way out with the corpse of an old wooden puppet. Doots played a piece she’d been writing called Silken Wing. But when Blotch begged Bar’Thur to tell a war story, he went quiet and sad.
</p>
<p>
	“I been wanting to talk to you about those visions the Technomancer been feeding me. I fall in battle.” All went silent again, but Bar’Thur simply smiled. “Don’t you dare be sad. I wanted you to know that I’m not afraid of death, I’m not running from it, I’m with you all ‘til the end of the road.”
</p>
<p>
	“Cause we all know how good frogs do with roads.” The group laughed, as Blotch lifted the bottle and poured a sip over her head. “We know that piece of crap planted all those dreams to pull us to Gladecleft, you need to leave that shit with that dumptruck ass of yours, man. Behind you.”
</p>
<p>
	With the mood and spirits lifted, they slept, but not well. Despite, Blotch’s words, Ria Grey was assailed by the same nightmare she had had for a year, of a death she couldn’t fathom, couldn’t understand. In her sleep, she scratched at the glowing translator behind her ear.
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	Doots had packed her bedroll away before Mookie had even opened their eyes. They stared at the dark murkiness, feeling more tired than the night before.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s still night.” Mookie mumbled, rubbing their eyes with their forelegs.
</p>
<p>
	Doots shook her head, running a whetstone down the axe edge of her keytar. “No, it’s just always this dark now.” The axe edge was sharp enough already, and Doots was just scraping the stone against the metal, causing sparks to fly everywhere. Mookie put a hand on hers to stop her.
</p>
<p>
	“What’s wrong?”
</p>
<p>
	Doots put down the instrument and pulled Mookie close, embracing them like a frightened child. Surprised, Mookie returned the embrace, squeezing their friend tight.
</p>
<p>
	“I felt like I died. But it wasn’t me. It was another…me. It’s so stupid, so crazy.”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s not stupid. Heath told us there was a you, another version of you, in his universe. The portal she made, sent him through, it drew you there. You might be feeling the deaths of other Doots Bardlys.”
</p>
<p>
	“You don’t think I’m crazy?”
</p>
<p>
	“No.” Mookie smiled. “Bar’Thur is having death premonitions, Hallie is so furiously revenge filled, Blotch is being extra snarky - no one is themselves.” Mookie shook their head. “Or maybe everyone is. Someone needs to convince Hallie to drop it, to abandon this. The Technomancer already won. It’s time to leave.”
</p>
<p>
	They turned to the far side of camp, where Hallie was checking over her armour and weapons, readying them for a battle no one else wanted. Heath approached her, his metal body glistening against what little light crept through the canopy.
</p>
<p>
	“Attempting to kill the Technomancer is folly.” He said, so direct and brazen that the rest of the group stopped what they were doing and fell silent. Blotch even put down the mutton leg she was disolving through her shell.
</p>
<p>
	“I didn’t ask your opinion, Heath.” Hallie muttered, keeping her eyes on her shield ‘Steve’. She was polishing it so vigorously that if it were sentient it would’ve paid handsomely for the privilege.
</p>
<p>
	“Maybe you should.” Heath said calmly. “I am the son of a Technomancer, one that destroyed or subjugated every world he came into contact with. If his equivalent is here, in this universe, I have one piece of advice for you. Run. Find the deepest, darkest corner of the universe you can find and hide in it. He is a cancer, a horror, a plague of locusts come to destroy your harvest.”
</p>
<p>
	Bar’Thur elbowed Blotch in the belly. “Sounds delicious.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie watched as Hallie put down her rag, and set the shield down on the floor. She looked up at Heath, her eyes narrow, but her voice still calm. For now. “This Technomancer took everything from us, every person we knew, our lives. We didn’t grow up sitting on his lap, being coddled like a little Prince Droid. We fought to stop him.”
</p>
<p>
	Heath was unphased. “And you failed, the same as I did.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallie gathered her stuff and stood, rubbing at her neck as she did. “Not yet.”
</p>
<p>
	*******
</p>
<p>
	The capital city of Etrus was once a gleaming bastion of interwoven nature, crystal and metal. The Great Tree of Harrad’Netarr, nearly a mile in height and with a root system that stretched even further, stood in the centre, its large, chambered structure occupied by homes and businesses of all shapes and sizes. The Great Tree was built into the organic framework of every beam and strut of the city. Natural leaf canopies shaded the roads, and roots plaited into bridges that crossed the rivers that flowed under and through the streets. Every shop was artisanal, no Starbucks, no McDonalds, no Walmarts. Shopkeepers traded hand-forged items and hand-grown produce. There was no poverty, no crime, no creepos wolf whistling women whenever they exposed an inch of flesh. The city had been alive, working with those who lived in her to grow and strive together.
</p>
<p>
	But now, it was dead.
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer’s bombs, pushed through Ithea for miles on electrical conduits, had been mistakenly absorbed by the tree's root system. And when they had exploded in their clouds of heat and light, the tree had split and ruptured. The absence of its girth from the horizon had distressed Hallie - that much was obvious - but as she got closer, Doots noticed her demeanour change completely. And by the time they saw that the tree had fallen, dead and blackened by fire, Hallie was moving towards the city at a near sprint, eager to kill whatever was left in the second of her homes to be gutted by enemies. She ran on adrenaline and rage, and quickly left them behind to the taste of wood smoke that still lingered on the air.
</p>
<p>
	By the time Doots and the rest caught up with her, she was knee deep in robotic zombie corpses, swinging The Fucker Upper with such force that a red mist surrounded her that turned out to be demon blood. Bar’Thur raised his cudgel, and Ria her pistols - ready to assist - but it was already done.
</p>
<p>
	Heath brought a scanning device up and held it aloft, everyone else more than slightly suspicious of the technology he held. It pinged loudly, causing their party to jump.
</p>
<p>
	“What now?” Taber hissed.
</p>
<p>
	Heath raised an eyebrow. “ All lifeforms left in the city are condensed into one area. A small shack carved into the outer mountain wall, with large catacombs underneath.
</p>
<p>
	“The enclave of the Mothman Propheseers.” Mookie muttered.
</p>
<p>
	Doots turned to her Moth friend, she didn’t want to go back there again, the place they had butchered her mind over and over. But if it meant saving whoever was left from that ghoul, they had no choice.
</p>
<p>
	Blotch, Bar’Thur, Ria Grey and Taber took point, picking off the Technomancer’s roving guards with little to no effort. They were efficient killers, and made short work of any fiends they found. Taber was a shroud of death, like that scratchy blanket your nanna has, moving unseen in shadows and tearing robots apart. Ria picked them off from the rooftops with her repeating crossbow pistols, her robotic eyes swivelling around to find new targets before the current arrow had even found its mark. She was always quiet and morose, but today she was non-communicative. Blotch and Bar’Thur were flamboyant, using any variation they could to takedown the enemy, the environment, weapons, each other. At one point Blotch stepped onto Bar’Thur’s cudgel and he launched her into a robot who she then absorbed, slowly disintegrating it in her own bodily fluids as it kicked at her shell from within. They were a whirlwind of death, and anything that got caught up in their dance was quickly destroyed. But there was a meticulousness to it, a machine-like quality. Hyper focused, efficient.
</p>
<p>
	Mookie and Doots spread amongst the rubble, looking for survivors, and finding few. Whenever they found someone, a Dwarf half buried, a Goblin scavenging, Doots played a tune that only they could hear on the Keytar that led them out of the city and set them on the path towards the boats waiting at the docks.
</p>
<p>
	From afar, Heath almost admired it. They were all so vehement in their defence of their people and world that it made him feel ashamed to have sat under his father’s shadow for so long. If 107 - his former friend and manservant - hadn’t bonded with him, would he have even been able to articulate these thoughts?
</p>
<p>
	Hallie stood by Heath, every 100 metres or so asking if he detected the Technomancer yet. It was infuriating.
</p>
<p>
	Eventually, they came to a small wooden shack sticking half out the mountain. As soon as they crossed the doorway, the scanner in Heath’s hand pinged loudly. A new energy signature. There were over 100 life forms huddled closely, and two distinctly different ones further into the complex.
</p>
<p>
	Hallie took the scanner. “What is this?”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s too low to be sure…but..” Heath began.
</p>
<p>
	“Technomancer?” Bar’Thur growled.
</p>
<p>
	Heath nodded, and immediately Hallie took the lead. She pointed to Doots, Blotch, Taber and Ria Grey. “You head towards the people we’re here to save, get them out and then rejoin the rest of us. We need to see if it’s really him. Mookie has seen him before, and Heath might be able to find a weakness of some sort. Bar’Thur’s with me for muscle.”
</p>
<p>
	“Why not me?” Doots asked.
</p>
<p>
	“Because you need to work out a tune to teleport those people out of here, like Heath said his version could.” Hallie knelt down as Doots returned a terrified look, putting a hand to the bard’s shoulder. “I know you can do it, just relax, like you always do. You’ll get it done. You’re great.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots nodded and her and the team vanished into the darkness to free whomever was waiting down in the bowels of the catacombs.
</p>
<p>
	*******
</p>
<p>
	Father Flicker, lead Seer of the Order, had been in the pit being tortured for three days now, so this new pain sat atop the old, and he barely even registered it. The same questions. Where was the Omniseer? Where was the Nexus? Where was Hallie Swiftfeather? The same response came back.
</p>
<p>
	“Why don’t you suck a discarded carapace you undead fiend.”
</p>
<p>
	“I like you, Flicker. You see the future and rail against it. It would be so brave, if not for its futility.” The Technomancer chuckled and ripped Father Flicker’s last wing from his back, where it evaporated into dust.
</p>
<p>
	“You seem awfully scared by an old moth close to death.” Flicker smiled through the pain.
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer slapped Flicker across the face. “Closer than you think.”
</p>
<p>
	His wings had now been taken, his two hind legs burned away. He was dying, that was for certain, but he could do so with dignity and honour. As long as Mookie stayed away…but oh god there she was, on the edge of the pit, with Swiftfeather, a frog, and a robot. Unless he was delirious, he hoped so.
</p>
<p>
	“Last chance, ancient thing. Where are they?”
</p>
<p>
	****
</p>
<p>
	Hallie watched the Father take hit after hit, feeling Mookie flinch against her with every blow landed. Hallie held her back, they needed to make sure the prisoners were free before they attacked. But her focus switched to the Technomancer, finally seeing it in its true form. Every part of it moved constantly, as if a tide of misery writhed underneath its cloak. Its hunched body juddered and twitched with every word and action, horned helm shaking. It was horrible to behold, a technological litch that threatened to kill them all. Bar’thur gripped his cudgel with white knuckles, wanting to jump down and rip the ghoul apart. Heath stood still watching the thing he called a father in a different body.
</p>
<p>
	“PING!”
</p>
<p>
	Hallie froze, all of them staring down at the scanner at her waist. She hadn’t silenced it. The good news was that Doots had figured out how to teleport the survivors out, the bad news was that the Technomancer apparently had ears under the ram horns.
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t think I need your services anymore, Flicker.” the Technomancer purred as he turned to face Hallie.
</p>
<p>
	“Fly Mookie!” Father Flicker shouted before thick black tendrils ran him through the chest. He slumped, dead. Mookie screamed in protest, but it was much too late.
</p>
<p>
	“Come to me, future corpses.” The Technomancer grined.
</p>
<p>
	Mookie flew at the Technomancer, hitting him and somehow flying between his attacks, anticipating them. Bar’Thur and Heath followed raining blows against the monster. As Hallie landed, she drew The Fucker Upper and slashed at the technomancer’s face, but he was too fast, stabbing her deep between the lobstered armour she wore at her ribs. It was impossible to fight here, the quarters too close, their opponent too devious.
</p>
<p>
	Bar’Thur was slashed across the leg severing his quadricep, and as Heath stepped in to prevent a barrage of tendrils sent to kill the Frogman, the android’s arm exploded in sparks and fizzing.
</p>
<p>
	“This is so much fun.” The Technomancer’s black tongue ran across its metal teeth. “Tell me when you’ve warmed up.”
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly, a golden door appeared in wall behind them and Doots, nose bleeding and looking as if she were about to collapse, appeared. “If we’re going, we go now!”
</p>
<p>
	Bar’Thur hobbled through, propped by a badly damaged Heath, as Mookie grabbed Flicker’s body and flittered towards the portal.
</p>
<p>
	“You go.” Hallie shouted. “I can’t let him live.”
</p>
<p>
	“Not today, General.” Mookie flew at Hallie, taking them all back through the portal as Hallie screamed and fought against the momentum.
</p>
<p>
	“You’ll be back, Swiftfeather! We have both seen it!” The Technomancer’s laughter echoed through the portal as it closed.
</p>
<p>
	*******
</p>
<p>
	(Perfect place to add a to be continued you may say, but nah.)
</p>
<p>
	Heath sat by the fire, tending to Hallie’s wound with his one arm, spraying her with the cellular regeneration spray. He had finished Bar’Thur’s leg an hour ago, but it would take a long while to fully heal. Across from them, Mookie stroked Doot’s golden hair as she lay in the Moth’s lap. The Bard looked close to death, her glow significantly diminished. When they had first arrived here, General Swiftfeather had ordered her to send them back, but the Bard collapsed, lacking the strength to even speak. The new ability had nearly destroyed her, and she couldn’t even fathom doing it again.
</p>
<p>
	Ria whispered to herself, rocking back and forth, the things they had seen in the prison hard to describe. They had gotten hundreds of survivors back here and then told them to march to the evac point. Heath knew they should follow, but his fellows were much too injured.
</p>
<p>
	“We fight again tomorrow.” Hallie stood and announced. “We go back after a night’s re..”
</p>
<p>
	“You can piss right off!” Bar’Thur stood, hobbling, and went snout to nose with Hallie. “Look at us Hallie, we’re four parts fucked! We’re no match for ‘im. Even if all eight o’ us were tip top. He’d kill all of us.”
</p>
<p>
	“Not if we….”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re cracked, lass. There ain’t no way I’m sending Blotch, Doots, or any o’ my friends here back like sacrificial lambs for your revenge. You’re almost as bad as the Tech…”
</p>
<p>
	The Frogman gasped thinly and lurched forward, then fell to the ground with a whispered call to Blotch. Four arrows stuck out of his back, thick green blood oozing from the wounds. Ria stood behind him, holding her crossbow pistols. She looked at them, her hands shaking, then at Bar’ Thur in shock, as if it was a stranger's finger on the trigger. The pistols dropped to the floor.
</p>
<p>
	Blotch knelt down to her friend, holding a hand to his mouth to check if he was breathing. But as no breath clouded Blotch’s hand’s shell, and her head fell, Heath knew that Bar’Thur was dead, slain by one of their own.
</p>
<p>
	“I…I didn’t…” Ria muttered, tears streaming down her shocked face even from her robotic eyes.
</p>
<p>
	Blotch flung herself at Rhea, her thick tube like fingers wrapping around Rhea’s throat and sending her to the ground. The rest of them froze, understandably shocked. Bar’Thur’s body lay there, his eyes open, the shock of betrayal clear on his face.
</p>
<p>
	“I’ll kill you, human!” Blotch’s jelly insides glowed a fierce red, her bones shaking in the boiling liquid. And it was then that Heath noticed something, her translator, pulsing red in the mix.
</p>
<p>
	“It wasn’t me, it couldn’t have been me!” Ria gasped, not even defending herself. “It doesn’t make sense.”
</p>
<p>
	“Do it.” Hallie whispered.
</p>
<p>
	“Kill her.” Taber shouted.
</p>
<p>
	Even as the tears streamed down her face, Mookie nodded. “She deserves it.”
</p>
<p>
	Heath looked at each of them, at the patches of skin on their necks, rubbed raw by incessant itching. He pulled a small steel orb out of a compartment on his thigh and set it on the floor. It detonated with a silent pop, but everything went silent. No birdsong, no sounds of nature, it was as if the world had switched off. Blotch let go of Ria’s neck, and Mookie and the rest seemed to shake their heads collectively, as if waking from a dream.
</p>
<p>
	“Welcome back everyone.” Heath said, pointing to the steel orb. “Communications disruptor.”
</p>
<p>
	***************
</p>
<p>
	“He’d been whispering through the translation devices you use.” Heath said, pulling an arm panel open. “Listen…”
</p>
<p>
	A repeating, hissing whisper could be heard from Heath’s arm. “Gillish. Fokar. Gorrem Vitus.” The sound was as if nightmares themselves were speaking directly to Mookie, visions of the deaths of friends and being alone, and it filled them with fear.
</p>
<p>
	“What does it mean?” Ria asked with a quiver, her hands shaking at the realisation of what she’d done.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s a curse. An old Dwarven and Lich dialect crossed.” Heath closed the arm panel and they all looked as if they were grateful for it. “Loosely translated it means ‘restless, unending fear’. It would have tormented you all to madness.”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch looked to Ria, and though she was ridden with despair she managed to look the Ranger in the eyes. “I’m sorry. I should've known it wasn’t…”
</p>
<p>
	Ria shook her head, muttering quietly. “You have nothing to apologise for. None of us do.” She turned to Hallie. “But I’m done. I’m heading for the Longboats at first light.”
</p>
<p>
	And so they were two down.
</p>
<p>
	*********
</p>
<p>
	After burning Bar’Thur and Flicker’s bodies so they couldn’t be used by the Technomancer,
</p>
<p>
	Hallie instructed them to all bed down and volunteered to take the first watch. She stared out over the woods, high up in her tree perch, and knew there was something different in the air. These woods felt strange, alien, as if like no place she had known. Like the very earth was poisoning them, she felt no connection to the soil or trees anymore.
</p>
<p>
	“Ingot for your thoughts?” A clearly exhausted Mookie hovered behind her, wings barely strong enough for sustained flight.
</p>
<p>
	“They’re not worth half of that, Mooks. Gods. Bar’Thur - I’ve known him for twenty years. He trusted me.” Hallie wept. “We’re going to die, aren’t we?”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie landed on the branch next to her. “We’re all going to die, Hallie.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallie tutted. “I meant fighting this thing.”
</p>
<p>
	“So did I. But let me ask this, if I told Bar’Thur he was going to die today, would he have tried as hard, fight as strongly, love as freely? There’s a reason we’re not supposed to know the future, Hallie. The question I should ask you is why fight? Why not run? The Technomancer has killed so many, let’s just get on the Longboats and leave.”
</p>
<p>
	“I can’t let it win, I can’t let it take anymore from us. Sometimes when you lose this much, the pain is too deep. Or is that just stubbornness?” Hallie sighed, but as she turned, Mookie had fallen asleep, their antennae twitching as they snored and leaving Hallie to the silence of the forest.
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	Taber had been awake for an hour before the others rose from their stupor. He was still tired, but liked the rumours that he didn’t sleep, it added to their suspicions of him. It was an new, odd feeling, to still desire to be the outsider, but to crave their acceptance. He supposed that’s what came with truly caring about people - even that Swamper Frogman he had come to call brother.
</p>
<p>
	He hugged the shadow of an oak, watching whilst Ria packed her bag and left. He had contemplated asking her to stay, but the horror she had committed, even though it wasn’t her fault, was too much to bear. He understood, and said a silent prayer to the dark for her safekeeping. And when Hallie Swiftfeather got up shortly after and marched back to Etrus and her destiny, Taber still just watched. Who was he to stop her? She needed to kill the Technomancer. There was no life outside of that road for her anymore.
</p>
<p>
	“Tell them I’m sorry.” Hallie said to him over her shoulder, somehow knowing he was there. “Good luck, Taber.”
</p>
<p>
	He said two prayers for her. She would need them.
</p>
<p>
	When Blotch woke, she made such a noise that Doots and Mookie instantly woke up too, both of them huddled together in one bedroll. Good for them, Taber thought. He watched as Blotch sit up in a daze, patting the roll next to her and looking for Bar’Thur. When her consciousness settled, and she remembered what had happened yesterday, her head hung for a moment.
</p>
<p>
	“Taber, where are Hallie and Ria?” Mookie asked, walking right up to him, with none of the fear or suspicion any of the rest of them had when they talked to the Darkling..
</p>
<p>
	“Both left. Ria to the north and Hallie back to her friend. There were no words to stop them.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie nodded, and helped Doots to her feet. “So what do we do?”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch pulled Bar’Thur’s jerkin over half her body and picked up his cudgel. And for the first time in his long life, Taber the Darkling hesitated. “What else?” He hissed.
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer’s forces had been busy overnight, scurrying and scavenging. They had pulled whatever dead bodie they could find in the town and made two large banks of the dead to act as a walled corridor to usher Hallie into the city. As she looked up, she saw the dead had started to be reanimated, eyes gradually opening and lighting up an eerie yellow to survey her approach.
</p>
<p>
	“You came back.” She heard the Technomancer whisper through the dead mouths. “Just as I predicted.”
</p>
<p>
	She ignored the taunt from blackened lips, and walked to where the entrance shack to the Mothman Propheseers once stood. It had been levelled, taking some of the mountain with it to create a flat circle of land where the Technomancer hovered on black tendrils.
</p>
<p>
	“As it should be.” It drooled thick black slime at the thought of killing her. “This has been a long time coming. A part of me, a small part, owes you for this.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallie said nothing, just drew her sword and shield. She pointed the blade at her enemy.
</p>
<p>
	“You know your little moth friend foresaw this when I first met them? Scared little insect never told you, did she? Too scared it would make you weep, maybe?”
</p>
<p>
	Hallie still marched towards it.
</p>
<p>
	“Feeling betrayed? Don’t worry, when we have our fun with you, I’ll make you tell me where they all are, and we’ll find the Bard and her little bug. A Nexus and an Omniseer will make me unstoppable. I might even use your other friends for foot soldiers. Except the frog of course, I imagine he’s a bit ripe by now.”
</p>
<p>
	Almost in response, the giant shadows of four evacuation longboats blasted into the atmosphere overhead, heading for some far off world free of this bony shitbag’s reach. Hallie smiled - her friends were safe and well. At the Technomancer’s scream of fury, Hallie ran at the monster, silent as she did. She kicked off a large clump of rock to attack it in the air, slashing through a part of its cloak and a tendril underneath as she landed behind it. In return, the Technomancer howled in pain and sent more tendrils her way, which she blocked with Steve, the Great Tree emblazoned on its surface. Hallie spun to one side and slashed again, carving more thick black cables from its body.
</p>
<p>
	The fiend screamed and lunged towards her, Hallie easily dodging the attack and running it through the back, right up to the hilt. It was easier here, in open ground, and with the rage gone, a calm set in. She was the best sword-wielder on this planet, and this ghoul was going to feel every bit of the pain it had given her, tenfold.
</p>
<p>
	As she pulled the sword from its back, its head twisted 180 degrees to face her, joints cracking so that its withered limbs turned too. “Help me!” A child’s voice screamed inside the Technomancer, and Hallie for a second saw the face of a frightened young Dwarf inside it. “Quiet vessel! You have what you wanted!” The Technomancer sneered, as Hallie took an upwards swipe that cleaved the Technomancer’s face in two.
</p>
<p>
	In its dying fury, its tendrils flailed wildly, one slicing clean through Hallie’s right calf. The pain drove her to the ground, blood pouring from a leg she would never use again. But at least it was dead, at least they would be safe.
</p>
<p>
	A thick, oily chuckling came for the Technomancer as it rose up, its face knitting back together with machinery and wire. It strode towards her, arms morphing into long black blades. “Is that it? Tut tut tut.”
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer lunged back, and when it turned back towards Hallie, six arrow bolts were buried in its body. Ria Gray jumped down to join Hallie, and helped her rise to her feet. “Needed to kill this bastard.” She explained, and Hallie nodded.
</p>
<p>
	Another Longboat flew overhead and hovered there, the noise of its engines flooding the battleground and blowing dust everywhere. A service airlock opened to reveal Blotch, who jumped out towards them. When she was about ten metres from the ground, Taber rippled out from behind her, acting as a parachute. As they both joined their friends, Blotch tutted. “Not killed him yet?”
</p>
<p>
	“Waiting for us. Needed the whole gang.” Taber nodded.
</p>
<p>
	Blotch charged at the Technomancer with all the speed a giant sack of jelly could, swinging the cudgel as if on the last ball of the over in the cricket world cup final at Lords Cricket Ground and the Technomancer was a slow arm bowler pitching a little too short and the field had been brought in to save runs. (Sports reference for the jock listeners). She beaned the Technomancer, denting its helm along the side with the spikes of the cudgel. When she was pushed back by the tendrils, Taber turned himself into a ball and launched himself at Blotch.
</p>
<p>
	“Batter up.” He shouted - he was a fan of Wizzball, the nation’s pastime, where wizards played a magical form of baseball you’ll never see, but it is the most amazing sport you can ever imagine. Blotch hit him towards the Technomancer, and he slithered into the beast’s armour, wreaking havoc inside as he morphed into all sorts of painful looking shapes before rejoining his fellows.
</p>
<p>
	Ria fired bolt after bolt at the monster, changing clips multiple times until she was out of ammunition. And when her pistols were empty, the Technomancer slowly begun healing again. Though this time, Hallie saw the body of the young Dwarf inside the closing cables, desiccated and pale.
</p>
<p>
	“That’s it,” Hallie said. “The body inside.”
</p>
<p>
	Ria grabbed The Fucker Upper from Hallie and ran at the healing fiend, only for it to grab the sword when the blade was only a foot from the body inside. It snapped the sword in two with his bare hands, and shoved a shard of it into Ria’s stomach. He held her aloft as the light went from her eyes, then chucked her dead body to one side.
</p>
<p>
	“Two down.” The chrome skull said.
</p>
<p>
	Taber and Blotch ran at the murderer, fighting back the incoming tendrils as they rushed forward. When they got close, they pulled the cables to one side and Hallie jumped with all the strength she had left. Swordless, she buried the pointed edge of her shield, Steve, into the heart of Timmy Blackcrest. With a scream, the Technomancer shedded away from the corpse of the Dwarf and fell to the floor, Timmy collapsing on the spot. If he were still able, he would have thanked them.
</p>
<p>
	“I would say something witty, but we have to get out of here now.” Taber pointed towards the army of zombified robots scurrying towards them. Taber turned himself into a long set of black stairs that they climbed to the Longboat, taking the body of Ria Grey with them. As the ship started moving slowly away from the dying planet of Ithia, Hallie turned back to the battlefield…and found the Technomancer still lived.
</p>
<p>
	The shroud the Technomancer had become, a wraith of hate and evil manifested in an AI named Eden, rose and glared at her. “No.” The thing screamed. As it raised her arms, the advancing dead bodies burrowed themselves into the Earth and rose at the Technomancer’s feet. They became a rising tidal wave that lifted the Technomancer at its head. It was rising fast, and it was going to engulf the Longboat.
</p>
<p>
	“Doots. Portal!” Mookie asked, and Doots picked her Keytar up, as weak as she was, she started playing.
</p>
<p>
	In front of the ship, a golden portal in space appeared, then immediately cracked into splinters, like a broken gilded mirror. “I don’t know what’s happening. It’s still open, but someone, somewhere has broken it.” Doots cried.
</p>
<p>
	“It doesn’t matter none, Doots. It’s going to catch us.” Blotch said. “It was fun guys. You know, except for all the death and stuff.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallie looked at the portal, the rising dead, and her friends. This was it, what she had seen in her visions, a chance to save the people she loved. “I really fucking hate that thing.” She said to Mookie, before she leaped  from the Longboat to the screaming protests of her family, holding the shield in front like a ram. As she careened into the Technomancer, she knocked it off balance, and gave the ship the last few seconds it needed to reach the portal. Before falling back to the planet she had loved so much.
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer rushed towards the portal and crossed the threshold, only to arrive somewhere she didn’t know, with no longboat in sight. She let out a scream of frustration at the escape of her quarry, before taking a deep breath and realising she would find them, it would just take more of what she had an abundance of now.
</p>
<p>
	Time.
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
