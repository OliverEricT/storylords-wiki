Episode 23: Liar, Liar, Pants Ceasefire

Prompts: Pacts and Sacrifices

By Rich Masters

It’d been three days on the Technomancer’s ship. Three days without contact, with Ellie, or Taber, or even the Technomancer himself. It was solitary confinement. Admittedly, he had a food replicator, laundry service, full home gym, and a television that even had raunchy channels on it, but apart from that, it was hell. There was only so much food he could eat, or working out he could do, or self gratification he could…well maybe there wasn’t a limit to that, bar a 25 minute refractory period and a snack banana. After he did his midmorning mental health masturbation and ate a light breakfast, Lionel laid down on the floor and started doing crunches to replicate the prison life, only to get winded at crunch number four.

Suddenly, the door to his room wooshed open to reveal the Technomancer, followed by Ellie’s new hologram body. He walked in, watching Lionel. In his hands, he held Ellie’s watch.

“One thousand and forty nine,” Lionel said breathlessly. “One thousand and fifty.” Lionel puffed out air and wiped his already sweaty brow.

The Technomancer smiled, or his version of a smile. To be honest, it kind of looked like the smile was fighting against its own nature. As if the Techomancer was holding a gun to his own face and threatening to fuck his wife if it didn’t comply. “It truly was a clever trick, Michael, trying to convince me you were Emmeth. I hope you don’t mind me calling you ‘Michael’. It is your official designation, this Lionel character just isn’t really you is it?”

“Um…” Lionel took the Technomancer’s taloned hand and let him pull him to his feet, his fingers suddenly felt colder than a polar bear’s love balloons after he’d just dumped his girlfriend with the ‘It’s not you, it’s me’ line. Ellie looked over to him, concern on her face. Looking at her made him realise how much he’d missed her, but also how much he was right - he wasn’t in love with her. Regardless, Lionel would give anything to get her out of harm’s way and back with the crew - she was his best friend.

“But I think your crew forgot that I’m not a machine anymore, I’m a cyborg. I have eyes, I have organs, I have a set of good dancing feet.” The Technomancer did a little twirl and threw out the jazz hands. It was genuinely the most terrifying thing Lionel had ever seen, like an evil Dick Van Dyke had suddenly become his nemesis, and it was creeping Lionel the fuck out. “I’m a little bit human these days. It’s in part why I want all this fighting to stop, why I gave Ellie a new body. I’m a nicer, more wholesome Technomancer now.”

Lionel made the same face as when his proctologists’ finger wanted to take things to the next level.

“I can see you’re sceptical, Michael, but I have goals and dreams of my own, and given that whatever power I have recently gained will wipe away in fifty years or so, and all this will be as forgotten as Mark Wahlberg’s racially motivated attempted murder charges, I’m keen to do whatever I can to avoid that. Even if it means pooling resources and working with you people I once called enemy.”

“If that’s true, then why did you send Emmeth to kill us?” Lionel asked,  his hands to defend himself and his voice primed to scream like a four year old.

“My experience at the Waystation, absorbing Forex Santo and the Android…it threw me into turmoil. My three selves were trying to vie for leadership, and I must confess the wraith part got the best of me, I let the rage take hold and sent Emmeth with ill intent. But now, I have become a fourth person. Someone not just fury, or scheming, or cold detachment, but a…”

“A horrifying combination of all those terrible things?” Lionel sneered.

“Lionel…” Ellie warned, taking a position between the two of them.

The Technomancer’s eyes narrowed. “I appreciate that my past behaviour might skew your perception of my motives. I’ll leave you to talk with Ellie, so she can back up what I’ve been saying.” He turned to leave, placing the watch on the table. “And if I can’t convince you, I’ll convince your crew. I’ve already sent a meeting hail to them via your shuttle. Until then, you’re my guest and you shall be afforded the privileges of such…the wifi password is bigdaddytechnomancer - all lower case- 69*.”

“Don’t touch Taber.” Lionel ordered. “Call your undead dogs off and I’ll talk to him when he shows up again.”

The Technomancer shot Lionel a look before giving a single nod and left, his long green cloak catching in the door as it swooshed shut behind him. The door opened and he pulled it back through, lifting a hand and whispering. “Sorry…cloak problems.” Before storming off again.

“Elie…what the hell?” Lonel began, before Ellie threw her arms around him and squeezed, he returned the hug, so happy to see her. She pushed him away slightly and put a hologramatic finger to his lips, then grabbed the watch and threw it to Lionel, before touching the watch face and transferring her digital self back to it. Lionel fixed the watch to his wrist and Ellie covered him in white scaled armour.

“Can you hear me, Lionel?” She said. “I’ve soundproofed myself so that snooping, undead  ears can’t hear us.”

Lionel paced back and forth, gesticulating wildly. “Why the hell do you want to stay, Ellie?! It’s an act! Davey Woodburn in second grade was more convincing when he said that if you ate hotdogs lengthways you were gay.”

“Because,” Ellie said. “What he says is worth listening to. And it might be the only way we get out of this whole thing alive, Lionel. Also I don’t love you and am worried I never did but we can talk about that later.” She said the last sentence incredibly fast, hoping it would take him a while to process.

“What…?” Lionel muttered.

“Been three days with no damn contact.” Grissom sat in the copilot’s seat, his expression grimmer than usual as he tapped the sensors with a finger, hoping to see a blip appear.

Blotch sat at the controls, flicking the ejector seat safety cover off. “What did I say would happen the next time you did that?” She sighed, flicking it closed again. Grissom wasn’t exactly worrying over nothing here. “We’re all worried Griss. But we said four days, didn’t we?”

Grissom stood, making for the mess. “Four days is a long time, Blotch. I just hope we didn’t serve Taber and Lionel up to that prolapsed hemorrhoid made flesh and bolts.”

He left, and Blotch considered his words. “Me too. Main course is getting smaller by the day. Technomancer won’t even have to chew.”

***

Doots had been watching Mookie staring at the prophecy tablet for two days whilst she played. She started by playing Your Decision by Alice In Chains, then moved onto Big Decisions by My Jacket, then Do it Again by Queens of The Stone Age. This morning she was playing Nothing Else Matters. It was all intended to encourage Mookie to make a decision, but as she finally put down the keytar, Mookie still just stared at the tablet. They had been so engrossed, Doots hadn’t had a chance to talk to Mooks about what had happened to her the last two days.

“I appreciate the efforts, my love,” said Mookie. “But this decision isn’t the rushing kind. I have to time it perfectly, and I’ve been reaching out with my other senses to try and find the right time for the universe.”

Doots put her hands on her knees. “I…uh…didn’t want to bother you with this, but if this helps…I started to remember, Mooks.”

Mookie turned to her. “What do you mean?”

“I remember it all. My past lives, before the crunch, before the thing that became the Technomancer and I were reborn. I remember you and I all the many times around. There was the time you were an established cop and I was the grief stricken dog-biscuit eating hobo cop. There was the life we both worked in the candy factory and we kept getting each other in trouble with our long suffering fake husbands. Or when I was the plucky starship captain and you were my stoic first officer and we were totally doing it on the regs. Or when I was a Private Eye and you were a Romani who talked to the dead. We solved crimes and in that universe they made a sitcom about us.” Doots smiled at the thought of it.

“What’s a sitcom?” Mookie looked puzzled.

“About 2 seasons of wit and then 5-7 seasons of outstaying your welcome.” Doots laughed, then realised she was confusing Mookie. “We were happy, and we didn’t chase the Technomancer, we just focused on the time we had left.”

Mookie shuffled in their seat. “Maybe we could just ride this one out too?”

Doots was aghast. “If we do that, we lose everyone.”

“We’ll find everyone again on the next spin, we always do.”

“It’s not the same.” Doots smiled, a bittersweet note to it.

Mookie frowned. “You’re billions of years old, Doots, you’re too old to just dismiss happiness.”

“And you’re not young enough to dodge your responsibilities. In all the lifetimes I remember, we’ve never come this close to winning. If you want a chance, Mooks, sometimes you just have to trust to fate.”

Mookie gave Doots a glare, then grabbed up the tablet and laid a foreleg on it. Instantly the tablet flashed with a bright flash, and Mookie’s black eyes rolled back. They fell back from their chair and fell in a fetal position. Just as Doots was about to reach for them, a hard shell began to form around Mookie, enveloping their body in a carapace of dark bottle green.

“Mookie!” Doots panicked, rubbing her hands over the shell and trying to find a way through. “Oh god, Mookie, please wake up, please.”

The door wooshed open and Grissom came in, sneering as he saw Doots kneeling over the cocoon. “I’ve not walked into some weird sex game, have I?”

“Mookie used the tablet, and now she’s in this thing!” Doots was rambling, panicking. She’d never seen anything like this in all her lives and she was scared. “We’ve got to get her out of this before…”

“Attention Peeps!” Blotch came over the internal comms. “We’re receiving an invite hail from Taber and Lionel’s shuttle. It says ‘dinner invite, BYOB. P.S. don’t be one of those people and bring stuff you wouldn’t drink yourselves, we don’t want no Gooseberry schnapps or any other weird shit’.”

Grissom and Doots shared a look. “Dinner with the Technomancer. Just what the mortician ordered.” Doots muttered.

***

Doots woke in a white room, lying on the floor. As she used her forelegs to rub her eyes, she heard a creaking of leather, and looked up to find someone sitting in a gaming chair and going to town on a grey, square controller. In front of them, a scene played out on a monitor of a purple clad ninja fighting a purple floating cloud with a star on its chest. As the floating starcloud shot a fireball at the ninja, he curled over and died. The gamer threw the grey controller at the television and slumped back in their chair.

“Fuck, shit, fuck.” The person said. “I’m never going to finish Ninja Gaiden 2 even if I'm here another thousand eons.”

Mookie coughed. “Um…excuse me?”

“If you’re expecting a go, you can think again. Get your own pocket of limbo space if you want to play Nintendo.” The thing said. “In fact, come here and let me look at you.”

Mookie rounded the chair to find a large Mothman staring back at her. “How?” She started.

“Well, well, well. Stoker found himself another Mothman. Interesting.” Stoker winked both eyes and hopped off the chair, and crouched down to her. He was an atlas moth, at least as big as Grissom. “I haven’t been watching reality for a few billion years now, but no one has ever gotten to this space before. You a nintendo thief, or are you trying to see how you’re going to cheat death, little one?”

Mookie nodded. “I used a prophecy tablet, and woke up…?”

“Here? This gaping maw in reality is my home. My Doots sent me here long ago to preserve me when the universe reset. I figured out the math for how long once, but I forget.” On the edges of the white room he gestured to, Mookie could see tally marks stretching back into the infinite horizon. “Yeah, it was a while, a curse really. Driven me a bit insane. I kinda hate her for it.”

Mookie gasped. “Are these years or…”

“Cycles - sets of five billion years. Every time I feel the universe reset, I draw a tally on the wall. You want lunch, or you wanna see what you’re here for first?” Stoker cheerily walked to a fridge that seemed to appear out of nowhere and pulled out a half eaten can of baked beans with a fork sticking out and raised his eyebrows to Mookie.

“No, thanks, I’m fine.” Mookie looked at some of the stuff in the fridge, a half eaten hawaiian pizza, biscuits and gravy, and some rose wine. He clearly was insane.

“C’mon then, little bug. Let me show you why you cannot win.”

***

The Swiftfeather touched down on the deck of the vessel and the crew disembarked down the ramp, beset on both sides by the Technomancer’s dead puppets, who stared at them with intense hatred and hunger.

“It’s like going back to my family for the holidays.” Blotch whispered, sneering at the hatred being directed their way.

“These people wanna kill us for simply existing, destroy our joy, crush our spirits.” Hijoki tried to give them some perspective.

“Yeah, so a typical family gathering, right? You obviously haven’t been to one for a while.” Blotch said.

Hijoki hung his head, his sock frame making him look like a flacid cotton penis. “She didn’t know.” Tamia said, lifting his chin back up. “And you got new family now, pop.”

Heath turned to Ludwig as he waddled down the ramp with Doots. The Krakenite was looking pretty uncomfortable, Doots stood next to him, looking back at the ship.

“They will be ok, Doots. There was nothing I could do to open the cocoon, so I do not fathom how the Technomancer could hurt Mookie if we leave them unattended.”

“That wasn’t as comforting as you think it was, Heath.” Doots sighed.

Grissom put a hand to Doot’s shoulder. “Don’t worry kid. If Mookie dies, we’ll avenge them.”

“Also, unsurprisingly not helping.”

A door at the end of the hanger bay opened to reveal an ominously lit room, and Grissom cleared his throat. “Well that looks like a mighty fine place to be obviously entrapped and suffer a full on slaughtering. You bring our housewarming present, Ludwig?”

“Don’t worry, it’s a fine vintage.” Ludwig patted his waistcoat and gave Grissom four tentacles up.

Tamia didn’t wait for them, and strode forward past the undead clutching her katana. “I don’t know about you guys, but I’m starving.”

The rest of the crew rushed to join her, and as they crossed the threshold, they saw Lionel and a blue hologram sitting uncomfortably alongside the Technomancer, who was at the head of the table pouring wine. He stood in a badly fitted green suit and tie, his chrome skull and hood popping out of the top. Grissom was of the opinion that since most people who wore suits were evil fucks trying to suck the life out of the universe, at least this sack of shit was being upfront about it with his hideous skull face.

As the Technomancer saw them at the door, he smiled a creepy grin and beckoned them to their seats. “Come in, come in. I’ve never hosted a party like this and I want you to all be as comfortable as possible.”

“So naturally, you’ll be slitting your own throat for us then?” Doots said glibly, remembering Hallie’s face as she threw herself out of the ship to save them all.

“That’s funny, Doots. I understand your mistrust here, believe me, I do.” The Technomancer suddenly saw a smudge on a fork by Lionel and gave a loud sigh, before grabbing a napkin and wiping it furiously. Man, thought Tamia, he’s crazier than anyone could have dreamed.

Grissom ignored the robotic devil and lowered his head to catch Lionel’s eye. “You ok, brother? Is Taber ok? Where’s Ellie?”

Lionel lifted his gaze and gestured to Ellie. “This is Ellie, look at her, she’s like a 13 year old gamer bros’ wet dream now!”

Ellie waved. “We’re fine, Grissom, but we haven’t seen Taber. He’s hiding on the ship somewhere.”

“He’ll show up, he probably just distrusts me as much as the rest of you do.” The Technomancer said. “ Please, sit.” He gestured at the chairs around the table.

Everyone reluctantly took a chair except Grissom, who stood at the door, his hand on the pistols at his waist. “Before you go into your spiel about being besties forever and picking out new places to meet for brunch,” Grissom shuddered, the idea of brunch like day-old, cold jizz in his mouth. There were already two names for it: late breakfast, or early lunch. Fucking kids, trying to rebrand everything. “We wanted to set our stall out early. Ludwig?”

Ludwig reached into his waistcoat and pulled a small metal device from one of his endless pockets. “It’s a small tactical nuclear grenade, good for urban clearing, war prevention and smoking Technomancer’s who get handsier than an uncle at Thanksgiving.”

The Technomancer slammed the wine bottle down on the table with such force that it shattered, before catching himself. “I’m sorry, I seem to have dropped our delicious wine. There is no need for idle threats, we’re just talking about the future. If I wanted, I could have killed you all before you even pulled that trigger.”

Blotch chuckled. “That is why the trigger is linked to three of our hearts. If any one of those three die, this place is absorbed in the type of Hellfire you would be right at home in, punk.”

“It was my design.” Heath tilted his head, smug at one upping the Technomancer.

“What I’m proposing is a pact.” The Technomancer said.

“Those of us of the non-psychotic despot variety tend to call those deals, or arrangements.” Blotch glared. “Doesn’t exactly inspire us with confidence when you start bandying around terms like that.”

The Technomancer sat, then steepled his fingers in front of cold, dead eyes. “There has to be peace between us, otherwise we all cease to exist. “He spoke through gritted teeth, trying to fight against his very nature. “Neither you, nor I want to die, not when we’ve all come this far. And now after studying Ellie, and my data and experiences with the Doots of various realities, I think I might have finally found a way to keep the universe living.”

“Why don’t you cut all the Homes and Garden crap and tell us what you want.” Lionel said.

“Half.” The Technomancer couldn’t help but smile, looking straight at Doots as he did. “If you want to propagate your hope, love, and care through the multiverse, then so be it. But I want the other half of the multiverse to sow discord, chaos, despair. My raison d’etre. We draw a line across the multiverse, you leave me to my half, I leave you to yours. A balance.”

The assembled crew were horrified, to abandon half of existence to him seemed so callous, so cruel.

“And if we refuse?” Doots asked, already knowing the answer.

“We keep fighting, I keep killing you, the pressure between the opposing forces grows, and the universe is forfeit.” The Technomancer said cheerily. “I don’t want to do it, but if I can’t win at least half of what I want, nobody will.”

***

“Here it be, mothling, the very reason why the answers you seek are not here.” Stoker and Mookie stopped at the edge of a white cliff, overlooking a white abyss. He brandished a fork at her, which she went to take.

“This is just a fork.” Mookie said, confused.

Stoker threw the fork down and stared out at the emptiness.

“Jiminy Cricketman. Wall? Wake up wall, you piece of monumental shit! We have visitor! I’m sorry Mookie, it sometimes takes a while to warm up.” Out in front of them stretched a vast tall wall of white in this white world. “This is the Origin Wall. where plans for universe comes from. If I say to wall, ‘Show me what makes me happy’…”

The wall flashed a million fractured pictures of Stoker’s Doots. She was magnificent, a muscly bound freedom fight with grenades for earrings. She had a face that said ‘try me’ and a butt that also said ‘try me’. It seemed in all realities, Doots was amazing.

“Now ask question, child.” Stoker gestured as he tipped his can of beans to get the last morsels out, only spilling sauce all over his front.

“Um, Wall, could you please show me how…”

Storker patted Mookie on the shoulder. “No, you do not say ‘please pretty princess wall, may I have with pony please.’ It is strong wall! Wall! You brick bastard, show Mookie how to defeat sorrow and save Doots and stop cycle of death and rebirth and blah, blah, hero shit.”

The Wall showed a million images, a million million images, from a trillion worlds and realities in quick succession, before showing a symbol of scales, and then going black.

“You see? When wall is asked impossible it becomes useless, goes the way of Dodo. The ones that stayed on Earth, not the ones that left to found new planet of dodo. “ Stoker pulled a random piece of cheese from his pocket, blew the lint from it, and gobbled it up.

“Wall. Please explain what you mean by this scale imagery?”

The wall talked in a harmony of vibrations and crystalline sounds. “The balance of sorrow and hope, positive and negative forces, matter and antimatter, are the unifying features of the construct of the multiverse. Realities would revert to a zero value without said features acting in equal and opposite balance. The Multiverse is currently experiencing an overbalance towards sorrow, and is accelerating to previously statednatural zero value.”

Mookie stepped forward. “Wall, is there any way to kill our Technomancer?”

The Wall cycled through images, one after the other, until it produced another symbol of the scales. “One cannot exist without the other. Realities cannot exist without either.”

“I told you, there is no way. You’re literally banging your head against a wall.”  Stoker laughed deeply.

Mookie huffed. “Wall, can we contain our Technomancer? Stop him somehow, and stop the reset?”

The wall showed the destruction of trillions of realities, seemingly alluding to the fact that the only way to stop this Technomancer was the destruction and reset of everything.

“You see, Mookie? It is as I said, the…” Stoker began.

“Quiet. Is there any way to ensure the continuation of our current timelines?”

This time, the wall didn’t cycle through images, but showed a circle rotating, as if it were considering. Stoker stopped laughing, as if he were seeing something he’d never seen before in his eternity here. Mookie was almost going to ask another question, when the wall finally showed the same picture of scales.

Stoker nearly bust a gut laughing. “I thought you had something there, child, but same wall, same answer. There must always be a balance. Good cannot win, bad cannot win. No hope, no solution.”

Mookie was crestfallen, all their efforts, the efforts of those they loved, were for nothing. Even if they won the fight, the universe would reset at the mere absence of the Technomancer. For all Mookie’s powers and abilities, all their work, all their sacrifices, the almighty balance was more important than the wellbeing of people, and there was no way for her to influence it. It was like organised religion, a stack decked of shitty cards.

“I’m going home.” Mookie sighed. “If the end of the world is coming, I’d rather be with my loved ones.”

“Can…can I come?” Stoker said. “I’d rather die in battle with a tyrant than go back to Ninja Gaiden 2.”

***

Aboard the Swiftfeather, the crew sat around the mess hall table. They had been given an hour to consider the Technomancer’s request, but silence had fallen over the crew for the last ten minutes. Ellie, tired of the standstill, cleared her throat.

“Is it worth considering?”

Lionel was appalled. “No!” Then he was confused. “I mean, no, right? We can’t just let him destroy half the multiverse.”

“There’s the question of if we can even trust him.” Ludwig sighed.

Heath was at the port hole, watching the motionless armies of the dead on the landing platform. “Oh, there is no question in my opinion, we cannot trust him.”

“He shared his plans with me, he truly believes this is the only way to survive. I think he’s genuine.” Ellie said.

Blotch cackled. “He’ll find some way to screw us over the first chance he gets. Ellie, he’s pure evil and raises the dead to be his minions. This is as close to a deal with the devil as we can get outside of a political meeting.”

Ludwig was drumming his tentacles on the table. “If only Mookie could come back and tell us what she saw.”

“But that’s not an option for now.” Hijoki shook his head. “And we can’t wait for them.”

“Look, we’re going to lose if we fight him, we know that.” Doots polished her keytar as she talked, but was rubbing harder than a middle aged mom at a Paul Rudd rom com. “And then we lose everything, everyone does. This way billions get to live.”

“At the expense of billions.” Grissom shrugged. “But it’s like I always say ‘the needs of the half outweigh the needs of the other half.”

“It’s ‘the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few’. That’s Wrath of Khan, I made you watch it months ago.” Lionel said, shaking his head.

“No, I’m pretty sure that was me, I think it was a family plotto.” Grissom nodded.

“Oh yeah, I’m convinced. It’s ‘motto’ you prat.” Tamia said. “We’ve seen him in action, we can’t beat him, we lose if we try. So the question is, is it time to cut our losses? None of us signed up to be heroes. We signed up to survive.”

“Then maybe that's all we need to do.” Mookie’s voice came from the back of the ship and they all turned excitedly to see…a slender, feminine looking moth they didn’t know, flanked by a six foot tall monster mothman. Grissom and Ludwig went for their guns, but Doots and Lionel held hands up to stop them.

“Mookie?” They said at the same time, the connection between the three of them was strong.

“It’s me.” Mookie said, in shock. “Why are you looking at me like that?”

Heath transformed his arm into a large reflective surface and held it to Mookie. The moth put forelegs to their face, unable to reconcile what they saw with what they were feeling. But it was Mookie that stared back in the reflection, a Mookie that bared an uncanny resemblance to…

“Death’s Head. You look like Death’s Head.” Doots grabbed Mookie’s forelegs. “You look so, so…”

“Different.” Mookie said, her lips trembling.

“Yes. But also beautiful.” Doots smiled, wrapping her arms around Mookie. “ What does this mean?”

“Probably that Death’s Head was my mother.” Mookie remembered her friend that always helped her, protected her, pushed back her Ascension day so she didn’t have to take on the pressures of picking a final form and sex that went with it. It turned out she still felt very much non-binary, and that was a relief. She gave a mental thanks to her mother who had died at the hands of the Technomancer, and logged another reason to hate him.

“I hate to ruin this touching scene - you look great kid.” Grissom smiled. “But why is there a giant, hulking mothman with you?”

Stoker strode across the mess hall and grabbed Grissom’s hand in his own giant forelegs, shaking it emphatically. “You must be Grissom. We were big friends in my reality, until you died in a tragic segway accident.”

Hijoki, Blotch and Tamia burst into raucous laughter.

“I wouldn’t be caught dead riding one of those.” Grissom was incensed, ashamed. “Are you sure you don’t mean Lionel?”

Doots ignored the clamour behind them, looking Mookie in the face. She was almost too scared to ask. “We’re kinda on a clock here, Mooks. What did you see in there? How do we beat him?”

“We can’t. There’s no future in which we win, we just have to find a way to lose the least. If this deal is the way to do that, we might have to take it, to preserve the other half of all life.”

A black goo began dripping from the air conditioning vent, only to puddle neatly on the floor.  It reformed quickly into a humanoid form that slithered over to the table. Taber was tired, exhausted from three days of slithering in vents and avoiding detection, and he nearly collapsed, only for Tamia to catch him and prop him back up. “Taber! We thought you were dead.”

“If the Technomancer had his way I would be.” Taber winced. “You guys can’t take this deal.”

“We have been over the moral…” Heath began.

“It’s not about morals, Heath.” Taber slammed his gooey palm against the table. “There’s something you need to know.”

Stoker cleared his throat. “I’m sorry, could I please visit bathroom, I held to be polite, but am bursting now.”

***

Tamia and Hijoki, Ellie, Grissom, Mookie, Stoker and Blotch joined the Technomancer on the bridge of his ship, a dark green polished room that contained only one chair for the Technomancer to plug into and command the entire ship. It was ostentatious, but a baller set up, and Tamia had to at least give him that.

“We agree to your terms.” Mookie said, watching as the Technomancer scanned them, deciphering their new form, cataloguing them.

“And I see you brought the muscle to make sure the ink dries on the deal. You look lovely, dear Mookie.” The Technomancer stood watching out over the universe at the clear viewscreen at the front of the room. “Much different from when I first met you.”

“You mean when you killed my mother?”

The Technomancer turned. “That was over a hundred lifetimes ago for me, but I am sorry. The part of me you call wraith was much more vicious than I am now.”

“Whatever, demon. What’s the next step?” Hijoki sneered.

“We divide our winnings, and then go our separate ways. Doots can open a portal and the technology I have reverse engineered from Ellie means I can keep it open and use it to transport my forces to the other agreed upon realities under my purview at my whim.”

His smugness made Blotch want to swing the cudgel at him, and it groaned under her tightening fingers. She also noticed Grissom and Tamia having similar issues, their hands wrapped around the handles of their weapons.

Mookie tapped a device in her ear. “Lionel, you down in stellar cartography?”

***

“Yeah, I’m here with Heath, Ludwig, and Doots.” He lied, as Heath projected Doot’s lifesigns in the room to fool the Technomancer’s sensors. “The guys are just checking the Technomancer’s line in the sand.”

Heath scanned the realities, and found the perfect one he was looking for, and noted down the frequency for Doots before giving a thumbs up. “Affirmative.” he said

With a few taps of the controls Ludwig checked the proposed line along the displayed multiversal map, then put a tentacle to his ear. “All looks good here kiddies. We are a go.”

***

Down in the bowels of the ship, Taber turned his arm into a screwdriver and removed the screws from the coolant housing. He placed a small metallic box in the open space, then screwed it back up.

“You know I could’ve portaled that in there right?” Doots said, crawling  alongside him. She was dulled down and a muddy yellow, emitting almost no light at all. Under instruction from Taber, she had been told to keep her lifesigns low to avoid detection.

“No, you couldn’t have, he’d have seen us, plus it's lazy writing. I spent three days dodging sensors and finding his blindspots. Just trust me.” Taber had a determination she had never seen, his jokes and barbs were one, replaced by a steely fury.

“Taber, are you alright?” Doots asked. “You said we can’t take this deal, but you haven’t said why.”

Taber moved along the service tunnel, Doots following. “My people were immoral, cruel, scumbags, Doots, but they were victims of a genocide. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone, regardless of the benefits.”

Doots felt a sting of guilt, they all did, but they were out of options. “If he leaves half of us alone…”

“I brought you with me to show you something. You’re meant to embody hope, well take a look through that next vent and tell me where the hope is there.” Taber gestured to an opening five metres from them.

Doots crawled to it and peered out. In the room beyond, an army of undead were being fitted with the tools of war in a production line. Armour, weapons, trackers, they were being prepped for anything but a slow spreading. They were being prepped for invasion. On their arms, Doots noticed small bands that looked identical to Ellie’s watch, and on a screen in front of them, squads were being allocated to realities not limited to the half that had been agreed.

“This deal has a ‘You scratch my back, I stick all the knives in yours’ quality about it, doesn’t it?” Taber said over her shoulder. “All he’s waiting on is your portal.”

Doots put a finger to her ear. “Doots here, Taber’s plan is 1000% a go.”

***

The Technomancer nodded his head. “So, we’re agreed then? Wonderful. When Doots can open the portal, you can disembark.”

Tamia and Hijoki shared a look, aching to fight. Tam could feel her mentor’s calming influence, his hushed tone in her head.

“Doots, are you ready to open the agreed upon portal?” Mookie asked.

An orange spiral spun in the viewscreen, and the Technomancer was bathed in golden light as the portal spun open behind him. He seemed almost happy, if that was a feeling in his range.

“I feel truly blessed and thankful for your actions here today.” He was crying, tears running down his metal skull. “I feel like this is a good time to sing. Wellllllll…

♪ if you take a cup of galaxies, a little spoon of fate

You’ll find those special nemeses that overlook the ha…♪”

Grissom shot the Technomancer twelve times in the face, destroying his metallic skull and sending him flying backwards into the viewscreen. “Only thing I hate more than undead despots is musical theatre.” Grissom announced as he picked up Tamia and flung her forward.

The ninja ignited her sword and sliced the recovering Technomancer’s arms clean off, pinning them both to the floor with the kunai Ludwig had been kind enough to make her. The Technomancer screamed in furious rage, thin, black tendrils growing from the places where his arms once were and pushing himself up. “Youuuuu traitorssss.” He lisped through the broken metal, as Stoker’s giant frame flew into him. The atlas moth grabbed him by his legs and swung him towards Blotch, who hit him so hard with the cudgel that his metal body cracked. As he fell to the floor, Mookie peered into the wound, seeing the swirling agony of each evil technomancer this one had absorbed, it was horrifying to behold, and it was all she could do to pull herself away.

“Come away, child. No one needs to look at that black despair.” Stoker spat into the gaping abyss inside the Technomancer.

A portal opened behind them, and Lionel, Doots, Heath and the rest stood on the Swiftfeather on the other side. “Anyone call for a cab?” Taber announced as he turned himself into a sheet that swept them all into the portal. All except one.

Ellie stood at the control chair, a hand on the controls. She tapped in, manipulating the many options until she found what she was looking for. Large manacles came from hidden panels in the walls and rushed at the Technomancer, pinning him down. “Manacles in your office? How creepy weirdo can you get?” She sneered.

“Ellie, get your butt in here!” Blotch screamed.

“Go. Someone has to stay and make sure this fucker goes along for the ride.” Ellie smiled sadly.

In response, the Technomancer turned to the approaching portal at the bow of the ship. The reality he was headed to was fire and misery, with no lifeforms to be found. Heath had done well to find it.

“It won’t make a difference, you fools.” He spat.

“We know all about your little portal jumping weirdos.” Ellie smiled. “Ludwig?”

Ludwig pressed a button, and the mini nuke went off in the staging area of the vessel, rocking the entire ship in a heaving toss. The resulting electromagnetic event caused all functions of the ship to cease.

“Now you’re not going anywhere.” Ellie was satisfied. This was worth everything to protect the people she loved. She was so happy that she didn’t notice the Technomancer’s tendrils approaching her. “Except where we send you.”

“Ellie, you can’t do this!” Lionel reached after her, held back by Taber.

“You’ll be fine Lionel. You don’t need me to be brave and heroic, you never have. You’re going to be great.” She blew him a kiss, just as the Technomancers’ coil of black wrapped around her foot. She screamed in pain, and then started to shrink, to decompile. She was absorbed, much like Lionel had seen the other technomancers be absorbed in the past.

The Technomancer was instantly freed, but vomited black bile all over the deck. His tendrils went limp, and he could barely move as he absorbed the last remnant of Ellie that stayed on his tentacle like a burned patch of white flesh. As the portal closed behind them, a bereft Lionel and Mookie looked at each other, unable to fathom what had just happened.

The Technomancer reached for the burn, wincing as he made contact, but there it was, a tiny, last remnant of her power. He thought about one final act of vengeance they could not overlook. He would wait there and they would come or him, they couldn’t not. The portal flashed one more time before engulfing the ship’s bridge.

***

“Yeah, we didn’t think about how we were getting out, did we?” Ludwig said as Mookie took a sobbing Lionel away.

“You bet your slimy ass we did.” Blotch yelled. “Doots?”

“Hold onto your seats, peeps, I’ve never produced a portal big enough for a ship before.” Doots played the intro to Jump by Van Halen over and over until her fingers bled with the strain. In the hanger bay, a portal grew under the Swiftfeather until the ship felt as if it were in freefall, only to drop into space a kilometre away from the Technomancer’s ship. As they watched the ship cross the threshold, something was visibly wrong. The Portal wasn’t taking him to the hellish dimension they had found for him, instead, purple mountains could be seen through the window.

As the portal blipped closed. Blotch cursed under her breath, and Heath turned to her. “What is wrong, Blotch? We have won.”

“What’s wrong is that I recognise that mountain range.” Blotch looked to her friend. “You see what I’m seeing, Taber?”

“Yep. That fucker just sent himself to Ithea.”

THE END
