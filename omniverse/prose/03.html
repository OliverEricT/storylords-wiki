<p>Prompts - Chainsaws &amp; Amputations</p>
<p>In the prestigious lobby of the Grand Uranus Hotel, eight Harvester mercenaries stood between Grissom Graves and his bounty, and his two phase pistols were running on empty. The Six Shot Satan - as he was known in some circles (as well as ‘that relentless cocksucker who could eat rat shit’ in other, far out of earshot circles and by his ex-husband) - was the last remaining member of the interstellar law keeping force known as the Dukes of Lead, 'Your bounty returned, dead, alive, or somewhere in between.' As such, he had half a damned reputation to uphold and he wasn’t about to allow some robotically enhanced scavenger scum besmirch his moderate name.</p>
<p>“Ah reckon ah should warn you programmerless tin cans, that I’m not a great shot with these here phase pistols, never have been.” He said in a voice so gravelly it was like he was gargling the devil’s own hairy brimstones. “So just let me by so I can deal with Cinnamonika, and I’ll be on my way and out of your sensor range. Otherwise the laser holes are going to be so messy that the shit in your bodies won’t be able to be returned in its original packaging.”</p>
<p>The Harvester leader, Cleft, chuckled in electronic static. “You can suck on my recycled lubricant fluid, Grissom! Countin’ must not be your strong point, you only have two shots left in those death givers and there are 8 of us. That means you are short by…” Cleft paused then looked at his compatriot with buttons all over her chest.</p>
<p>The half woman, half machine typed numbers into the pad which appeared on the screen upside down across her stomach. She looked up and grinned. The display said 'BOOBIES'. The Harvesters laughed, but not Grissom Graves. “I’ve never been short of boobies in my whole damn life.” Grissom muttered, tempted to tell them about all his many sexual conquests. But they didn’t deserve to hear about such legendary tales.</p>
<p>Harvesters were lower than a no-legged penguin’s nutsack and twice as worthless. They had started as modders, giving themselves the most obvious and necessary robotic enhancements like longer man meat, or girthier man meat, or giant hydraulic man meat. But in the last half a centenium, the cyborgs had started incorporating any useless machinery they can get their claws on, they were more machine than man now. Cold and dead, much like his ex-husband's heart.</p>
<p>One of the Cyborgs made a shrill ding, and opened a compartment on his body, to fill the room with a sugary smell. “Can we speed this up, the biscuits in my chest mounted easy-bake oven are done!’</p>
<p>“Those delicious breakfast cakes aren’t the only thing that’s done, you rust-ridden shitbird. I may only have two charges in the guns, but I got these.” Grissom held up his fists, one tattooed with the word ‘pain’ and the other with ‘slightly smaller amount of pain’. It was his left after all, and he weren’t no dirty southpaw.</p>
<p>Grissom and his opponents stared at each other over the countless dead Harvesters the Duke of Lead had already sent back to silicon limbo - he imagined hell was too good for ‘em. His fingers brushed over his pieces, playing with the settings as he waited for them to make the first move. Grissom spat into a dead Harvester’s skull, and because it had been fashioned from an old Pontiac firebird, it made a pleasing metallic ting. Suddenly a Red Dog Chewing-Tobacco flavoured Poptart popped out of one of the Harvesters scalp to cut through the silence. Her compatriots all turned to her stupidly, so Grissom took his opportunity. He hurtled directly at Cleft and picked him up like a battering ram, using his body to deflect the various cutting beams, lasers, and flying poptarts until he had lined them up in his sights.</p>
<p>With the one shot in the first gun, he brought the laser pistol around Cleft's skinny frame and shot a hot, fizzling load straight through the remaining seven lined up Harvesters, thankful that mechanicals couldn’t help but be pedantically neat little idiots by design. The band of mercs were suddenly as holey as that whorehouse planet in the middle of skinning season. As they fell to the floor in hissing fizzes, the Harvesters played the windows shut down noise.</p>
<p>“Looks like your lucky day, Cleft.” Grissom pulled the trigger on the gun in his hand, hearing it whine an empty protest. “All out of death juice.”</p>
<p>“But you have one charge lef…” The leader realised his mistake, and began begging.</p>
<p>“Oh lookie here, you can count better’n me, bot.” Grissom grinned as he pulled the trigger and reduced the cyborg’s head to slag with the charge in his last gun.</p>
<p>“Slow clap, slow clap, dear Mr Graves.” Cinamonika stepped out from behind a grand piano in the corner of the ballroom. Cinamonika was a Laverian, with indigo skin and deep, black eyes. They were an ostentatious race, from a planet without colour, so every offworld Laverian typically dressed as if they’d taken a money shot from a bag of skittles. Cinamonika read the fury on Grissom’s face, not to mention the way the Lead Duke was marching towards them threatening to kill them through snarling teeth, Cinamonika held both hands up and threw Grissom the old blinky eyelashes normally reserved to indicate the no pants lambada. “It was a test, my darling! I wanted to see the legendary Grissom Graves in action, and you passed with flying colours. Mostly red obviously. I have a high paying job for you.”</p>
<p>“I like my targets like I like my drink,” Grissom snarled. “Exactly what I expected them to be and not offering me jobs.” Grissom might have been good with killing, but not with metaphor. He marched towards Cinamonika and was just to wrap his meaty hands around their scrawny neck when Cinamonika announced nonchalantly. “It’s about some Harvesters…”</p>
<p>Grissom stopped as if someone had greased a hot iron and slid it twixt his nether cheeks. He genuinely didn’t like leaving loose ends, which is why he had burned the house he shared with his cheating ex-husband to the ground with the bastard inside. But this, this was too tempting to turn down. “Tell me more…” He muttered.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The trip to Fellandra 7 was short, just a few days. Luckily his ship, the “Conveyance of Grissom Graves.” - again, Graves wasn’t one for imagery - had only recently had some modifications including the new slip drive and that cool racing stripe with the decal of the naked three buttocked arial dancer. Grissom spent the journey mainly on autopilot, doing the things he usually did to prepare him on the way to a mission. Cleaning his pistol, polishing his pistols, polishing his meat pistol, then staring menacingly at an old picture of his absentee father whilst he cracked his knuckles. You know, the usual stuff.</p>
<p>The Conveyance of Grissom Graves touched down in a clearing on the forest moon, about ten klicks from the Harvester base (he liked measuring things in klicks, it made him feel fancy.) It was a hellish sweat box that made him long for the cold heart of his ex husband, before he remembered what a piece of worm ridden duck shit that man had been. Cinamonika had explained the dense forests of Fellandra 7 would prove challenging to find a path through to the Harvester deathsquads, but they knew Grissom was a patient as a dog on heat after his wife had given him a bad case of blue balls, then given him a crate of the really good dog porn for christmas and told him not to touch it - he would find a way, even if his balls exploded with rage in the meantime.</p>
<p>After an hour of quiet stalking, Grissom came to a mound of leaves in a small circular clearing. After he had checked for traps, he rounded the mound - coincidentally the name for his favourite sex move - to find a small steel hatch in the leaves. No stranger to opening doors, Grissom swung open the hatch to reveal something that chilled him in a way no other thing could...little punk ass kids. Between ten and fifteen cybernetically enhanced children, cowering in the makeshift shelter.</p>
<p>“What in star-nation?” Grissom muttered. “Tell me I didn’t come all this way to find some half breed ugly little crotch goblins?”</p>
<p>Grissom was so taken aback by the scared kids cries and so pleased with himself over the crotch goblin zinger, that he didn’t even hear the group creeping up on him out of the brush, the chainsaw being revved. And it wasn’t until the bite of the teeth started tearing through his left arm that he realised he’d been led into a trap like a prize heffer and now he was getting royally bull-humped. The last thought that went through his mind, other than a fury that threatened to burn its way outta his gut, was “Not my jerkin off arm!”</p>
<p>Achem. Author’s note: I know what you’re thinking right? I said he wasn’t no dirty Southpaw, right? And they cut off his left arm right? Well listeners, Grissom Graves was a dual wielder, ya hear. I’m saying he was Ambidickstrus. Dicks Akimbo! Alright. Let’s get back to the story. Fact checking bitches…come at me bros!</p>
<p>A noise of guitars shredding flared in Grissom’s head. But it wasn’t real. You see, Grissom Graves' flashback noise wasn’t a harp, it was like Van Halen, Def Leppard, and Whitesnake all started playing gee-tar solos at the same time. I know what you’re thinking, rad as 80s hell right? Well not really…it was really discordant on account of all the cocaine, and it sounded like a band of feral cats all got their little cat wieners caught in their zippers. Anyway, Flashback.</p>
<p>*GUITAR NOISE*</p>
<p>Grissom’s young life had been one of happiness, he had all the games consoles, he had a mom who overcompensated because his dad had gone for cigarettes when he was five even though cigarettes didn’t exist in this galaxy, and he had two of the remote control cars that could flip over and keep going…like it could go at 90 degrees and shit. I always wanted one of those, but we had carpeted floors, and my parents never bought batteries, so I never asked for…oops…sorry about that, tangented a little there.</p>
<p>As the son of the Queen of the Duchy of Lead, his life was the sweetest since that kid at school whose uncle worked at Nintendo. He was destined to be one of the raddest people alive, living in service to the innocent and getting more tail than a Sonic the Hedgehog erotic fanfiction.</p>
<p>That was before the Technomancer came. The metal skulled, chainmail wearing, ramhorn adorning, robotic Lich that would haunt Grissom’s dreams to this very day. His undead cyborg zombies decimated the Duchy of Lead without warning, destroying their beautiful, verdant home before you could say: “Not my jerkin off world!”</p>
<p>It was only thanks to his mother’s consort, Jaxon Swiftfingers, that Grissom was able to get out with his mothers guns and his head intact (and his beloved stuffed bear Dirtnap, which still sat on Grissom’s bed). Jaxson was a good man, for someone who was boning his mother on the regs, and he took the young Grissom under his protection and taught him the ways of lead, making him the most efficient killer in 14 sectors except for space-syphillis, because that shit is nasty.</p>
<p>But now Jaxson was gone, and rage filled Grissom’s heart. He had vowed to hunt any cyborgs with a vengeance that burned hotter than a ghost pepper enema.</p>
<p>*GUITAR NOISE*</p>
<p>Grissom sat up with a start, looking for his guns. The room was dark and he could barely see through the gloom, but for a shaft of light from a hole in the patched roof. All he could make out was that he was in a soft bed with fresh linen. A goddamned pussy’s bed.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry young man, but we had to remove your deathbringers.” The voice came from the corner of the room, about a 1000th of a klick away. The voice was older, feminine. Calming even. “This is a peaceful place, we don’t even watch the Director's cut of Robocop here, the cool version where Murphy gets his hand blown off and he holds it up and you can see all the bone and the veins pumping blood out.”</p>
<p>Grissom was fury personified. “But that part is the best bit!”</p>
<p>“I know, I know.” The stranger placated, “but this enclave is dedicated towards healing and peace.”</p>
<p>“But how do people empathise with Robocop if they don’t see his horrible, disfiguring injuries?” Grissom asked.</p>
<p>The voice made a sharp intake of breath. “I’m glad you think that way. Take a look at your arm, gunslinger.”</p>
<p>A cold sweat ran in rivulets down Grissom's back, soaking a shirt that he now realised ended at the elbow. His whole arm felt cold, almost absent. Like that time he sat on his own arm to see if he could simulate someone else jerking him off. It felt like another person’s arm. Now his sight had adjusted to the light, he brought his arm up to his eyeline…his arm had been replaced with…his own dismembered face!</p>
<p>His fingers darted to his face…no wait, there was a nose, two eyes…his face was still there. Taking another look at the arm, he realised the apendege was actually a mechanical arm, polished up to a mirror shine. He felt sick to his stomach, as well as more than a little brain fried.</p>
<p>“You’ve turned me into a damn abomination!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I did the best I could, but the mechanical arm was all we had I’m afraid.” The doctor sighed. “We thought you were attacking the kids.”</p>
<p>Grissom flushed. He was insulted, he didn’t kill kids. Unless they attacked him, or were going to attack him. Or if they were particularly ugly looking maybe. I dunno, the situation hadn’t come up yet.</p>
<p>Grissom leaned back, his eyebrow raising. “I was told this was a cyborg training facility. A death squad factory.”</p>
<p>His captor leaned into the light, to reveal an ocular implant that reflected the small light back at Grissom. “No, sir. This is a hospital complex. My name is Dr Latoya Winters.”</p>
<p>He flinched. “You’re a Harvester too?”</p>
<p>“Come with me.” The Doctor gestured.</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>The air was as crisp as that first dip in a cold pool when your balls shrink up directly into your body like you were some sort of squirrel. Grissom heard laughter, felt the calming effect of the planet and its inhabitants. Kids were running around playing, little half machine kids playing tag and…whatever stereotypical innocent kids play I dunno…tic tac toe? Mortal Kombat? Hell nowadays they probably just grease two of their fellow kids up, stick em in a cage and watch them just pull each others legs off. Kids are fucking cruel, dudes. But these kids were cool, and didn’t engage in any limb ripping. In fact, they were almost serene.</p>
<p>“It’s a respite centre.” Winters said, more than a hint of sorrow in her voice. “These kids were the first ones taken by the Technomancer. Experiments. They’ve got bad installations, rejection issues, viruses that are tough to treat.”</p>
<p>Grissom was filled with complex feelings his strong, manly brain couldn’t comprehend. These kids suffered like he had! At the hands of that despotic droid donger! He wanted a toasted cheese sandwich because he’d slept past lunch! Now Grissom was part machine like these kids! There was some sort of realisation he was coming to, but he needed some time to catch up.</p>
<p>“Overwhelming, isn’t it?” Winters said. “All we can do for them here at the Sanctuary is keep them comfortable, and make them happy.”</p>
<p>It just didn’t make sense. Why had Cinamonika sent him here? Bad intel? Just for the yucks? Then as the proximity alarms went off and the doctors and kids scattered to the underground facility, Grissom realised. Fellandra 7 was a dense forest, and nobody could be found there unless they wanted to, unless you had a good tracker leading the way. And Grissom was the best. For the first time in his life, Grissom Graves cursed the fact that he was too fucking awesome.</p>
<p>“Trouble's coming.” He told Winters. “But I got an idea, remove anything from the grounds that makes this place look like a hospital.”</p>
<p>She reached into her coat and handed him his guns, then Grissom revealed his big plan. Grissom, and the patients and doctors of Fellandra prepared, and some cool music played over the montage. Oh man, you should have seen it but, I lack the words to describe Grissom’s preparations. They should have sent a poet, or just someone a smidge more articulate than I, or someone without a word limit. Just take my word for it, it was cool.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>An hour later, Cinamonika led the Harvesters through greenery as dense as a contestant on the Bachelor, tracker in hand. “He’s here. Close.” They said to their team.</p>
<p>“Closer than you think, bitchface.” Came a voice from behind them. Grissom was cock out, urinating up a tree. Everyone turned and pointed their guns to the Duke of Lead.</p>
<p>“Grissom. You did it! I had my doubts, but you were every bit the dumb trusting idiot they said you’d be.”</p>
<p>“What do you want here?” Grissom said as he zipped up. “These aren’t soldiers, they’re sickly little pissant kids.”</p>
<p>Cinamonika fanned themselves with a hand and then turned really suddenly serious and pouty like a Dragonball villain. “Kids with state of the art mods. I plan to slaughter them, strip them for parts, and then sell their equipment to the highest bidder.” Cinamonika laughed in the sort of high pitch mania reserved for that methhead down your street that tries to fight postboxes. “This is your only chance, Grissom. Join us, or be mulched.”</p>
<p>Grissom didn’t like the odds, fourteen Harvesters and a flamboyant purple alien. So easy to just turn away, he owed those kids nothing, and they’d be dead soon anyway. He’d have more work if Cinamonika sold the parts, more bounties to chase, more Harvesters to kill. What were these little pissants to him? He stared down at his arm, his new affront to every rage-filled belief he had. He wanted to rip it off and beat this planet to death with it. He could and should walk away.</p>
<p>So he did. He turned and walked away and he let those kids die horrible, slow deaths…nah I’m just kidding. I mean, how fucked up would that be? I’ve got a kid of my own. If I ever end a story like that fucking call social services.</p>
<p>The arm winked back at him in the sunlight. Since he was a child, Grissom’d always hated himself, because he was a male and like all men was bred to be a toxic, emotionally compromised idiot, but he was oddly at peace with the arm. It felt …right somehow.</p>
<p>He turned to Cinamonika and spat on the floor between them “If I can’t kill these kids, then no one can, except the crippling techno diseases and system failures, probably. But no one's going to kill them today.”</p>
<p>Cinamonika gestured widely to their army. “You’ve got a familiar issue Grissom, too many enemies and not enough phase charges. And all these trees prevent your line-up trick. It’s over.”</p>
<p>Grissom sniffed and tried to look cool, which because he was already a natural badass only made him twice as awesome. In the connecting three systems, women spontaneously got wet without realising why, and men got so hard they couldn’t walk properly for a few hours. You know what they say, a butterfly flutters it’s wings in Fellandra, and everyone jizzes their pants on Ceti Terania 6 , or something like that. “You’re right, the trees are a problem. For you!”</p>
<p>Grissom threw one pistol at the foot of a tree, where it had been set to overload. The blast of piping hot plasma grew to a large, throbbing red orb of energy that ate away at the trunk. The Harvesters looked up at the creaking of the enormous tree that hurtled towards them. Too slow to move, too awestruck to dodge, at least half of them were pinned or crushed by the felled trunk.</p>
<p>“Fire!” Cinamonika shouted at the dumbstruck band of morons.</p>
<p>“Don’t mind if I do.” Grissom responded, feeling smug as a pig in muck whose toast always landed butter side up and had just won the pig lottery. He shot one Harvester, then another, being sure to hit the fleshier parts.</p>
<p>Grissom took a shot in the leg, and fell to one knee, but styled it out into a roll and took the head clean off a Harvester, who - because he was mostly robotic - cursed in binary as his head flew through the forest until it was nested in by a bird. He would live out his infinite lifespan being a creche for baby birds. Grissom shot another, then another, and one more. Two left now.</p>
<p>Then Grissom felt his shoulder burn as he took a tranquilliser shot in the arm. He collapsed into the dirt dropping his gun.</p>
<p>“Poor little fleshling.” Cinamonika mocked, “Now you know why we all mod!” Cinamonika pulled his shirt to reveal he too was a Harvester. And of course, a monumental prick.</p>
<p>The bastards advanced hungrily, like an Onlyfans model’s discord page. Advanced right where they needed to be. And Grissom just had enough strength to lift his new robotic arm, unaffected by the paralysing agent. “Playtime.” He announced into the comms unit he held.</p>
<p>An army of kids jumped out of their secret leaf pile hidey-holes, and pounced on the two remaining Harvesters, pouring punches and kicks onto the mercenaries and smashing them to component parts in seconds. Ruthless little monsters, like all children.</p>
<p>Shaking, Cinamonika suddenly realised they were now alone and they grabbed up the nearest kid they could, pressing a knife to the girl’s throat as they backed away. “I want out of here, unmolested, or I skin this kid.”</p>
<p>“That’s your problem, Cinamonika. Always underestimating people.” He gave the kid a wink as two others helped Grissom to his feet.</p>
<p>The girl pulled a wire from her hand implant and plugged it into Cinamonika’s chest, transmitting her virus to them. Cinamonika dropped the kid in shock, as they were assailed by ads for Russian dating sites, clickbate articles showing penniless celebrities as they are now, and siteripped crunchy roll episodes that froze halfway through. Cinamonika crumpled to the floor.</p>
<p>Grissom pushed his way off the two kids that had helped him up and sauntered to his prey. He wrapped a hand around the villain’s neck and squeezed. “Wait…” They whispered, and gestured for Grissom to come closer.</p>
<p>Grissom obliged, his eyes bulging as Cinamonika whispered a bombshell into his ear. When the flamboyant alien was done, Grissom could’ve let him go. But he didn’t, he used his new arm to choke every piece of life from the Laverian, and when he was finished, Grissom was suddenly intrigued to try out his new jerking off arm.</p>
<p>He dropped the corpse to the floor with a thud that disturbed the leaves but not Grissom's intense stare. He was lost in thought, not noticing the kid approach him.</p>
<p>“What did he say?” Said the kid.</p>
<p>“He said the Technomancer sent them.” Grissom sneered. The emotion pressed heavily on him, feeling the weight of his own history bearing down. It was as if his ancestors were all staring at him, expecting an answer. A decision was made, a mission reset, finally, at last vengeance would be…</p>
<p>“Who?” Said the kid, completely ruining the moment.</p>
<p>THE END</p>
