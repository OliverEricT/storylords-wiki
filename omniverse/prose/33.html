Episode 7: Time Enough to Get Wrecked


Prompts: Blood and Festivals


By Rich Masters


Well hello there. Time for another trip to the Omniverse, eh? Seven episodes in now, and I know what you’re all thinking - you’ve raised a lot of seemingly disparate elements early on in this story, Masters; The Pillars, the political structure of Ilima, other planetary powers, time travel through Rifts, those weird scientists having a sex party all the way back in chapter 1, fratricide, rhyming gnome-like attendants, and the bombing of a senate building, none of which you’ve explained or even really connected yet. When are you going to start explaining stuff? You’re seriously not going to leave us hanging for another chapter, are you? Are you? Oh, please tell me it’s not time for another patented character change to tell the next part of the story from their perspective, to give us listener blue balls? Right? Riiiiiiiiiight?


Anyhoo, Florgo sat at the counter in a droid detailing and sexbot emporium named “Metal Mammary Mart - the triple M with the best selection of double Ds”, staring at the outside world passing him by. There were parents escorting their ugly little crotch-goblins, old people complaining about every person and thing they saw even though it had no bearing on their lives in anyway (fuck you, old people), and on the far side of the road, a spacedog was taking a shit and his owner just walked on by without even bagging it. It wasn’t exactly what he had anticipated when he’d moved here from the Veil. The denizens of his home were nomads, the equivalent of Space Amish (or SpArmish for ease of typing). Florgo had needed something other than space station raises and chat about what their neighbour Old Ted was doing - spoilers it was nothing, fucking nothing, just like every day in SpArmish country. He came to Ilima, for adventure, for excitement. Not to sell metal cum receptacles to gross old men and women.


“If you’ve got time to lean, you got time to clean!” Lloyd Business, the weird little frogman owner of the Triple M, croaked as he exited his office in the back where he cultivated his spawnhub saved videos list and then updated his spreadsheet for slimyness and ‘jackability’. “I thought you Veil people were supposed to be studious and hardworking? For the less than minimum wage I pay you, I expect more from a minority, because Ilima is obviously better than you’d have in your own country. I assume, otherwise why would you be here?” He went to the window and looked across the road at their competitors at Ilgott and Gains, the second hand droidsmiths that took stolen parts. “Today’s the day, Florgo, I’m going to fucking firebomb that place. He’s selling the Dildotronic 3000 for a full 20% less than us. And it comes with the advanced handjob updates, 90% guaranteed not to tear your whole dick off!”


“Does that mean it might still tear some of your dick off 90% of the time,” Florgo asked, confused. “Or is there like a 10% chance of complete shlong-ectomy?”


Lloyd turned around, his face as angry as a cop whose wife has made a decision about her own body or life in any way. “I don’t know! I don’t use these sad droids, I use prostitutes or some sponges, a latex glove and a pringles can, or a picture of a clutch of eggs…like a real man! Now get to cleaning!” 


Florgo grabbed a cloth and went to the racks of hanging, realistic nude droids. He hoped that Mr Business wasn’t going to notice that the ‘try before you buy’ filters on the Sexbots hadn’t been emptied in a few days. He cleared his throat. “Are we closing early today, Mr Business?”


“Close early?” Mr Business became as red as a beetroot who had to explain to his beetroot wife that he thought he had gotten herpes from that hookup in the ally behind a Wendys that night. “Whyever would we close early Bob Cratchet…I mean Florgo?”


“But it’s the Festival of Giving Thanks!” Forgo found it hard to believe that Mr Business would have forgotten, it was the founding holiday of Ilima, where the routine election took place that the Union had always won since the end of the galactic war. There would be dancing, and balloons, and turkey, and whatever else this holiday was about. I assume some sort of sporting event.


“Like a filthy immigrant can vote anyway!” Lloyd Business laughed and his jowly neck shook racistly. “What are you hoping to find there, tips to take back to your undemocratic, thirdworld…erm…world?”


A low rumble interrupted Business, and he stopped his intolerant tirade to look concernedly out the window across the road at Illgott and Gains. Business shook his fist at the store front. “I’ll bet they’ve turned the gangbang mode up too high, those novices. Rookies shouldn’t dabble in sexbots!” He shouted.


In response, a stronger rumble shook the whole shop, knocking the full racked sex bots off their racks. “Oh, sweet metal titties!” Lloyd grumbled. “I rue the day I got into the Dick Droid mark…”


Florgo was blasted back into a counter display of oily lube that smashed and leaked all over him. He was peppered with glass, a painful moneyshot that dotted his face with stinging lacerations. But it wasn't from the display. The storefront windows had been blown in, and when he got to his shaky feet, he surveyed the store and the street outside, which had been reduced to a bigger wreck than your mom and dad’s relationship after you were born, you terrible disappointment. The street was torn up, a wide trench dug out as it tore its way to the shop, which was a pile of sexbots and rubble. Forgo jumped the counter and looked for Lloyd on the floor, only to find a bloody smear leading to something that was only partially human.


“Fuck me.” The voice grumbled in a low, breathless voice. “I must be dead and gone to heaven, I’m surrounded by steel sweater meat.” A cybernetic hand jutted out from mass of robot nudity, and Florgo thought for a second this might have been like that Kim Catrall movie, the Mannequin, which was a hallowed text on his world. Also, not a bad movie, a fact that I will fight to the death about. Admittedly, it’s a weird hill to die on, but I’m in that sort of pissy mood where I will throw hands about anything. Oh, you got a different opinion? Weeeeell, why not email me at I-don’t-give-a-gnat’s-taint@fuckoffanddie.asap (I added a hyperlink to help you out).


As the bloodied, cybernetic man sat up, Florgo saw that he was covered in blood, and that under him the smear of Lloyd Business had been spread over the sticky linoleum tiles of the shop like Josh spread your momma’s butt cheeks last night - Why Josh, you ask? Well I’m certainly not touching your diseased ridden family tree with anything less than a chainsaw. As Florgo put a hand down to him to help him up, A long, thin Reap blade slid under his chin. “Keep hands to self, boy. You don’t want to catch some debilitating STI from this one.”


Florgo turned to find a woman in Reapskins smirking at him. Behind her a Velit crocodile splicer stood next to what looked like a Roboticop in a full length ball gown and feathered headdress. Alongside them was someone that even Florgo recognised - The Pillar of Ilima known as Wrath, carrying an unconscious girl in her arms. Back home he had heard tales of the Pillars, superheroes of Ilima that he could look up to and aspire to be one day. The Pillar looked back out the way they came, and as he looked at her, he saw the tear cleaned streaks in the grime snaking down her face and under her chin. They had all been in the wars. “The Roboticops are coming. We have to find a way to the spaceport now.”


“We at minimum need some grand distraction for the roboticops.” The crocodile man growled. “I do not see a way out of this without bloodshed.”


Florgo cleared his throat and everyone turned to him with narrowed eyes. “Erm…I have an idea.”

Kellan stood at Asher’s bedside looking down at her baby sister who was now about five years older than her. She was looking much better, the colour returning to her already pale cheeks.  She was so beautiful, blonde and lithe and muscled, though her face was marked with little scars across her nose and at the corners of her mouth, the freckly little kid she knew was still there, buried just under the surface.


“Are you awake?” Kellan whispered loud enough to not be a whisper any more.


Asher stirred. “I was until you woke me. Why is it that I haven’t seen you for nearly twenty years and you are still somehow just as annoying as when I fell through the Rift? Is personal growth something that has passed you by?”


Kellan fell on Asher and wrapped her in her arms with a sob.


“Oh, god. Anyone would think I was lost in a hell timeline and got stabbed in the abdomen the moment I reunited with my family…Oh wait, that did happen!” Kellan sat up with a groan and hugged her sister back. “Don’t be a moron. How were you to know? Mum and Kell…Wrath had to keep what we were doing a secret.”


“I’ve been trying for a year. To get you back.” Kellan said. “We left your room, your things, everything is the way it was.”


“Thank the gods. When I was fighting off Demons with the Reap in the future, I really thought ‘I really wish I had my build a bear and crayons with me.” Kellan smirked. “I don’t suppose you kept that dress of yours I always liked?”


Kellan sniffed and wiped her eyes with the back of her hand, she felt like a weight had been lifted off her already overburdened shoulders. “Like you’d fit in it now anyway, fatass.” 


Asher swung her legs around the bed and punched Kellan in the arm. “Hey, I’m the big sister now, I get to be the bully.”


Kellan looked at Asher’s legs, covered with scars from crude stitching and poorly healed wounds. “Where have you been, Asher?”


“If I tell you that, it might never happen. And then I might not get home.” Asher stared at Kellan with a deadly seriousness. “And I won’t go back there, Kellan, I’d rather stick my finger in a Riftdemon’s bunghole and then blow in his fang filled face. I was lucky to get out of that place alive.”


Kellan sighed and stood, moving over to Asher’s monitors. “Wrath said she was going to be honest, I need to know this stuff so I can help you.”


Asher reached over to her skins and pulled them towards her, she winced, then took a second before pulling them over her medical gown. “Sister dear. Wrath is you. You know there are things you need to protect people from. She couldn’t tell you everything, or she would cease to be. She’s been involved in some questionable activities, activities she can’t burden you with the knowledge of yet.”


“Like whatever happened to dad?” Kellan glared.


“She can’t…talk about that…at all.” Asher said, steadying herself with a hand on the bed. “I didn’t know she’d…told you she had anything to do…with it?”


Kellan stepped back, her thumb on the control to administer pain relief to Asher. “She didn’t, but you just did.”


Asher slipped back onto the bed, and lazily reached for Kellan. “You…clever…shit.” She said, before slipping into unconsciousness.


***


The trip home was longer than Kellan could bear, but as she moved through the corridors and towards her mother’s office, anticipation was replaced with anxiety and her blood went from hot to cold. Wrath and her cronies, Asher, they couldn’t have murdered her father, could they? They couldn’t have killed 18 innocent - well they were politicians so let’s drop the innocent bit - people? Kellan stopped through the door and checked her desk. What exactly was she looking for, a confession letter? Bomb blueprints? A cloak with ‘I killed my husband and all I got were these lousy robes of office’ printed on the back? As always, Kellan was like a bull in a china shop, but one that got confused when they got there and didn’t really know what to do. She was more a fucking dickhead in a china shop.


“...You need to stop worrying, the election will be fine. The Norngarrd and the Velit have left already, the vote is simple formality for them, they’ll back themselves out of general principle even if they know which way the vote will go. The Union vote for themselves, and the VEil are friends of ours. It’s the Festival of Giving Thanks that’s the main worry, anyone can strike at us from there.” Etty Amray’s voice carried down the corridor, and Kellan quickly moved to the balcony, leaving the door open so she could hear.


Wrath preceded Etty through the door, and took a seat immediately on the far side of her desk. “It’ll certainly be easier to do what we need to do without the Norn and Velit here, we can’t have them snooping around my younger self as we’re trying to teach her, General.”


“Call me mum, would you Kellan? It’s creepy you calling me by my title when we’re alone.” Etty stood at the window looking out onto Ilima. If she had looked down, she might have seen her daughter ducked behind a balcony chair amongst some particularly curious pidgeons. “We need to just get through the vote. Securing another 5 years will mean we can start fixing things in this timeline. I only wish the bombing could have happened after the vote, Korvis’ political influence could have proven useful the last few weeks.”


“We couldn’t take the risk. Removing the senators delayed the Union’s movement on The Veil.” Wrath muttered. There was more than a hint of regret in her voice. “Even if it’s created a small risk, there’s no way any enemy could exploit that.”


So that was it, they had both so much as admitted it. They had arranged to blow the senate up, and with it her father and 17 other people. Kellan’s cheeks ran hot as her stomach turned over inside her. She felt nauseous, but also wanted to go in and confront them, those two women who had stolen her father from her. Why? How could Kellan have grown to the point where she could have thought it acceptable to kill her own father? Why had the pair of them killed someone they professed to love? And now, who was she going to talk to about it? Where could she go? Then it hit her, a bird flew off the roof and hit her square in the face, and when she had shooed it away and pulled the feathers from her hair, it really hit her: she knew exactly where to go. With a jump over the balcony, she was gone.

***


Wrath saw something in her peripherals, a blur at the balcony that she went to investigate, but suddenly Oryx burst through the door to Etty’s office, three imperial guards hanging off of him and trying to stop him from maybe eating the General. Wrath turned instantly and grabbed Doomcock reflexively. Oryx was followed by Hallgrim, who looked like he had gone 12 rounds with Mike Tyson, but not the one you know, the Mike Tyson of this timeline, the celebrated makeup and special effects cosmetic artist who specialises in injury detail. On reflection, either Mike Tyson could have been used as an example, but I didn’t want to use an anachronistic analogy, this time travel stuff is confusing enough. Maybe I shouldn’t have used 12 rounds as a unit of measurement, that was a mistake. Note to self, don’t mix metaphors. Also Hum13 was there, for some reason he had dressed in a very formal and very ill fitting purple and black teenagers ball gown, matching fascinator and Jack Skellington purse. The gown hung off his shapeless frame, and when he curtseyed to General Amray, the straps fell from his shoulders and revealed his featureless chrome body. 


“Mercy.” He exclaimed, hurriedly pulling the straps back up. “I should have had my tailor alter this occasional dress I have believably had since my graduation. I must have lost weight this season.”


Wrath tried not to laugh, putting her fingers to her mouth. “Hum13, you look like someone has kicked a steel bucket through a Hot Topic. What the hell are you wearing?”


“He had to go get dressed for the Festival.” Hallgrim rolled his eyes. “We tried to convince him we had urgent news to pass on, but then he started to get all ‘kill mode enabled’ and we left it.”


Hum13 narrowed his eye slits. “Are you talking about me? Suspicion at 83%. KILL MODE EN…”


Oryx put a calm, meaty hand to Hum13’s head as his hands turned to blades that lashed out at them. Thankfully there was no reaching anyone, and as Oryx made calming, shushing noises, Hum13 put the knives away and came back into the room. From Oryx’s expression, they had been through this a few times today. 


General Amray stood, a worried look on her face as she rounded her desk to the rest of them. “This is all fascinating and potentially terrifying, but whatever possessed you to enter here? We can’t have anyone linking your activities to me.” 


As Humie pulled a flower from the General’s desk and tried to put it in his non-existent hair, only for it to fall unceremoniously to the floor, Hallgrim pushed past him with an exasperated sigh. “Boopi Di Beppi had some info that could fill in some of the gaps in why things went so bad in your timeline, Wrath.”


“Kellan.” A raspingvoice came over the radio at Wrath’s waist, it was Asher. “She knows. Or at least, she thinks she knows why Dad isn’t around.”


Hum13 raised his hands. “Um…the information I have is related to this current happy-haps. It seems whomever is after Kellan is going to attempt to take her today. It was a capture-kill order, and they intend to use the Festival as cover. As soon as the vote is done, they intend to go ahead with the plan.”


Wrath caught Etty’s concerned look and brought the radio to her mouth. “Asher, we need to find her before she does too much damage to the timeline. Are you ready to go hunting?”


“I’m already on my way.” The radio cut out. “Send the creature features to Marble Square, they can blend in with all the other costumed freaks and we can search for her.”


Wrath turned to the others, feeling Etty growing anxious at her side. “Find her.”


“You mean you?” Hallgrim said.


“Just go!” Wrath shouted.


As the three left to find Kellan, Etty turned to Wrath. “What about you? Aren’t you going.”


Wrath bit the inside of her cheek. There was only one thing more important than trying to find her young self. “I’m sticking with you. I don’t have your faith in politics.”

The Union embassy was much like any embassy building you might have ever seen…wait what do you mean you’ve never seen an embassy building? Have you never worked in the civil service and had to attend boring meetings in the joy suck blackholes? No? Oh, ok. Well they're normally unnecessarily elaborate stone buildings, with ornate detailing and full of boring farts who think what they do is the most important thing in the world. In the Union Embassy building on Ilima this was doubly true because the Minister of the Unionised Planets, Jiran Greywood, along with his wife, Umbra Greywood, were in residence. They were like family to Kellan and she could think of no one else she could trust, despite their unhealthy interest in her Rift powers. If they took her back to the Union, at least she would be away from the family who killed her dad.


Lady Umbra placed a cup of tea down in front of Kellan even though she hadn’t asked for it, because that’s what all old people think solves the ills of the world. Have inherited a dumpster fire world of divisive politics? Tea! Can’t afford a house because the Boomers ruined the housing market with flipping property like they were official Alf pogs? Tea! Can’t get a job in your field because of rising living costs preventing you from working your way up, in a system propagated and cultivated by them? Tea! I’ve got a ‘T’ for you, it’s at the end of the C,U, and N I’ve written here, you degenerate old walking skeletons.


“You see, I’ve thought about what you offered, and I’d like to take you up on it.” Kellan muttered, unable to meet their eyes. “I’d like to go to New Earth with you both.”


Jiran gave her shard look over the top of his glasses. He put down his - you guessed it, tea - and leaned back in the chair in their well appointed lounge. “I don’t understand. You seemed horrified by our initial suggestion, my dear. I must admit I was planning on talking with Etty first, but it’s odd that you have had such a turnaround.”


“Tell us what’s wrong, dear.” Umbra Greywood flashed her old lady smile at Kellan as she sat beside her, placing a hand on Kellan's knee. “We’re your family, we can help.” 


She hadn’t thought this through, which was a typical Kellan emotional response. How could she tell them that Etty and Wrath had betrayed her so, without putting her brothers and Asher at risk? The risk that further innocents could be caught in the crossfire was too high. “I…I can Riftwalk. I can open and close the portals that have been plaguing us. It’s me, I’m the cause of them.”


“Well dear, not the only cause.” Umbra said with that smile.


“You knew already, didn’t you? I thought you were eluding to it at Dad’s funeral, but I didn’t know you knew.”


“We’ll take you back with us, kiddo.” Jiran leaned forward. “We can teach you how to use these portals and help us, your mother, and every one of our friends.”


Kellan stood, knocking Umbra’s hand off her knee. “But I don’t want to learn how to use it, that’s not why I came to you. I want them gone, they’ve caused too much suffering already.”


“Oh, kiddo,” Jiran stood and rounded the table, then punched her with a right cross so hard that Kellan slumped to the sofa. “Who gave you the impression you had a choice?” He smirked at Umbra, who stood a little straighter. 


***


Etty Amray entered the hall along with Wrath, where four curved tables were arranged in a large circle. At one, a screen displayed the Technarch of the Norn, who was playing Mario Kart with someone over the planetary net. “Don’t Blue Shell me, you filthy organic. Curses, pipped on the last corner.” He said.


As soon as he noticed the others, the letters AFK appeared on his screen and his giant face appeared on the monitor. Next to him, a life size hologram of Queen Promiscua of the Velit sat cross legged. She splayed her fingernails out in front of her, obviously bored. 


Next to her was someone Etty knew well, Elder Tallis, from the Feldar, the representatives of the peoples of the Veil. He wore his ceremonial robes, and a neutral expression, but nodded to Etty and Wrath.


Lastly there were Minister and Lady Greywood next to them, who gave a big wave to Etty as she walked into the centre of the room.


Wrath stood at the doorway to the Great Hall, but Etty continued into the middle, standing in the centre of the four tables and beginning.

“Rulers of the Four Interplanetary Powers, we are here today…”


“We vote for Velit.” Queen Promiscua stated loudly. “No offence Amray, but I have to get back to my milk bath before it becomes tepid and my male attendants think their fingers are for something else other than massaging my various throbbing body parts.”


“The Norn Technarch casts a vote for the Norn.” The Technarch declared loudly. 


“We the Veil, as we have since our independence was recognised, vote for those that assisted us in our hour of need.” Elder Tallis gave a nod. “We vote for the Union.”


“A surprising and riproaring turn of events.” Promiscua sighed. “Let’s put this dying dog down and get back to our lives shall we?”


“The Union abstain from the vote.” Jiran Greywood said, staring Etty in the eye as he did so.


Etty’s face dropped, and she felt as if the ground beneath her feet had been snatched away. A vote for each of the three ruling classes would mean a deadlock, and ultimately a civil war. “No, you can’t. Why?”


“We feel that now is the time for further discussion surrounding the ownership of Breakthrone, and the Iliman ruling party.” Jiran announced. 


“Turn the destroyer around,” Queen Promiscua gave the order to her captain. “We go to war.”


The Technarch simply turned his signal off, he would be sending a fleet to Ilima with but a thought. Both the Norn and Velit ended their transmissions.


“What have you done, Jiran?” Elder Tallis stood, incensed, his grey moustache and beard twitching with fury. “You bring centuries of war right back to our doorstep?”


The old man was hit with a blast from a laser pistol held by Umbra Greywood. “Shut your babbling, you old turd.”


“You’ve killed us all.” Etty said, the nauseousness rising in her, as Wrath came to her side.


“That was kind of the point, my friend.” Jiran flicked a switch in a small compartment on his belt that Etty had always assumed was where he kept his old man boner pills. Their two faces became younger, the wrinkles vanishing, the yellowishness of their gross oldie faces becoming a more healthy pink. 


Etty looked at Wrath, who shrugged at her. “Are we supposed to know who you two are, because I feel like that was supposed to be a dramatic reveal and I’m drawing a blank.”


“You wouldn’t know us. We’ve been here for a long time.” The woman said. “Scientists posing as various figures in order to gain power.”


“We’ve been stuck here waiting to move on, but your timeline is too resistant.” The man said through a sneer. “It’s quite admirable, and we’d study it if not for the fact that we simply can’t be bothered to. Easier to just force our way out. And now we’ve found the perfect key to do it.”


“Grorp!” The woman shouted into the corner of the room, all traces of age gone from her voice. “Get your ass in here.”


Grorp, the disabled attendant to the Pillars of Ilima, stepped out of the dark of the great hall, dragging the unconscious frame of Kellan behind him. Wrath gritted her teeth at the sight of the betrayal and the abuse of her younger self. “Give her to me, now.”


“We have business with the girl.” The man explained. “She’s special to us and our plans. If you back the Union in the war, and help us get out of this shithole timeline, we’ll keep her safe and you can have her back.”


Etty stepped forward and bent down to her daughter, watching her breathing, seeing the blood caked around her nose. “And what’s stopping us from just taking her?”  Etty drew her sword, prompting Wrath to pull Callous from her back and aim it at the Greywoods. Etty held a hand to Grorp. “Come on Grorp, you don’t have to be afraid.”


Kellan, roused, the light from the great Hall’s braziers glinting across her face. She opened her eyes and smiled at her mother, who smiled right back at her.


Grorp took Etty’s hand hobbling for a few steps, then completely Keyser Sose’d and started walking normally, his spindly frame straightening as he approached Etty. He pulled something from behind his back, and Wrath shouted to Etty to move far too late. Etty was shot through the stomach by a laser pistol which smoked in Grorp’s hand. Kellan and Wrath screamed in unison as their mother fell, the smoke from the blast snaking up and out of her mouth. She landed alongside Kellan, who cradled her and sobbed.


“Little Kellan finds herself adrift,

But now we have the key to Rifts.


Since we have means to meet the ends

Do you want Grorp to rouse our friends?”


Jiran smiled at Grorp and nodded. “Yes, my boy. It’s time Wrath…I mean Kellan, found out the ramifications of trying to change the course of history.”


Wrath pulled Kellan away from the body of their mother as Grorp spoke into a communicator. Wrath handed Doomcock to Kellan, the tears still flowing down her face, she took the hammer and looked at it in confusion. “We’re leaving now. If they come for you, swing like Epstein from a jail cell. But…you know…purposefully. Wait, you wouldn’t know that reference. Swing hard is what I’m saying.” Kellan nodded as Wrath pointed her rifle at the now older looking Greywoods. “You’ll let us go, or you’ll die.”


“Grorp?” The woman held a hand out and Grorp threw the pistol to her and retreated to the shadows. As soon as she caught it she shot the man in the leg, then sat with him as he yelled in agony.


“Wrath, What have you done?” A voice came from behind them, and as they turned, the trap was complete. The Pillars of Ilima: Will, Ward, Writ, Way, and Watch stood behind her, weapons in hand. The Wraith was still off world, and the Word was still missing. But all her other allies stood behind her, staring in horror.


The Will tutted. “I knew she would stray from the path the gods laid for us. She has always been blasphemous and willful.”


The Way stepped forward, as the science leader he wanted evidence before they would act. “Wrath, tell us this isn’t what it looks like.”


Before Wrath could speak. Umbra Greywood screamed. “She shot General Amray and my husband, she meant to kill us all and take Lady Kellan.” 


A look down told Wrath that Kellan was hearing none of this, she was as reliable a witness as the mannequin from the film The Mannequin before she turned into Kim Catrall. Wrath felt the sweat drip down the inside of her helm as the Pillar surrounded her. “N..No, that’s not true, it was…”


“Two shots that were so deftly fired,

From Wrath’s own rifle in righteous ire.


She means to use the throne for ill,

Or poor Kellan’s blood she sure will spill.”


Grorp came from the shadows again hunched over, the playacting enough to convince the Pillars. “It’s lies.” She gritted her teeth. Not when she was so close to figuring it out.


“Then you can come with us to figure this all out.” The Writ, the calmest of them all, the lawmaker, put out a hand of friendship. “ You know we can’t let you walk away.”


The others clutched their weapons tightly, ready for her next words. Wrath felt Kellan’s weight shift, her body tense up. Her emotion was getting the better of her at the sight of her mother, all Wrath could do was to use it.


“You’ll look after Kellan?” Wrath asked.


The Watch nodded, lowering his head to get Wrath’s attention. “She’ll be safe with Minister Greywood, who else is more trustworthy than family?”


“Over my dead body.” Wrath sneered. “They killed her mother, your general. She’d be better off with her siblings.” Wrath squeezed Kellan's hand and hoped the message had gotten through.


“Enough,” said the Will. She had always hated Wrath, at least this time she felt she had a reason to be an A-grade twat. “Take her.”


Then Kellan screamed in fury and Wrath felt the room turn cold and the floor fall out from under her as a Rift opened below them as the Pillars advanced. They fell down, but then as they cleared the Rift, fell sideways. Into the dirty streets of the Festival of Giving Thanks, right at the feet of Asher.


“What the hell are you doing here?” She said in shock, Oryx, Hallgrim and the still ball gown wearing Hum13 behind her.


“Wrong siblings, kid.” Wrath held Kellan’s face in hers and pulled her helm off, putting their foreheads together. “But well done. We’re going to make those bastards pay, you understand that?”


Kellan nodded. “Where are we going to go?”


Wrath looked around at the crowd of people that hadn’t even noticed the chaos. “We’ll get Rin and Targus, and then it’s time for you guys to go.”


Oryx cleared his throat and Wrath turned. “I think we have more immediate concerns.” An army of Roboticops were marching towards them, the crowd running from the brandished weaponry. 


Hum13 put up his fists, Marquis of Queensbury style. “Robots? Lemme at those affronts to humanity! I’ll teach them a thing or two about biology trumping….TEMPORARY NETWORK OUTAGE, PLEASE CONSULT MANUFACTURER…sorry, what was I saying?” 


“Get to cover in that sexdroid shop, I’ll see if I can override their programme, hopefully they’ve got some sort of hive mind.” Hallgrim said, pulling wires from his wrist.


“Why would you assume that?” Asher shouted after him. 


“This is what happens in all lazy writing when a band of heroes fights an army. You take out the main thing and the others just stop working. And this story is like 12 pages alrea…”


An explosion rocked the ground in front of Hallgrim as an RPG hit the street, blowing him backwards and through the window of the Metal Mammary Mart. Oryx shouted after him, he and Asher bounding through the storefront after him. Wrath picked up Kellan and nodded to Hum13. “C’mon Princess Trashcan.”

Florgo cleared his throat and everyone turned to him with narrowed eyes. “Erm…I have an idea.”


Yes, we’re back to the first part now. You remember, the sex bot shop? Look, you gotta pay attention, this shit is important. Even that stuff I said about your mothers.


Florgo rushed to the counter and swiftly typed command protocols in. “Just give me one more minute.” he said, not really knowing why he trusted these people. Because they looked cool? Because they weren’t trying to exploit an immigrant? Ease of narrative? Who knew?


“Hurry up, kid.” Wrath was looking out the broken glass to the street. “They’re here.”

“Come out with your gross, pudgy little sausage digits pointing to the inefficient energy source you call the sun so that we may summarily execute you with force!” Roboticop Officer P1GG13 shouted through his hand that he had transformed into a bullhorn. He turned to his fellow officer F85C15T. “That should get them to surrender. If I know filthy humans, they will logically see that they cannot win and just march out to face their deaths.”


“That is a trashcan, I am over here.” Said F85C15T from his other side.


There was a low hubbub that came from the inside of the Triple M, a set of voices speaking all over each other. P1GG13 turned to speak to the army of Roboticops that was probably a disproportionate response, but hey, that’s how cops roll.  


“Get ready Bots!” He shouted, prompting all the bots to raise their disruptor pistols. He was satisfied, he had only asked for them to get ready, but their desire to kill indiscriminately fit with being a law enforcement officer.


Suddenly, bodies started pouring out of the building, much faster than they could efficiently gun down without cause. Over the din of gun fire, P1GG13 could hear a chanting. 


“COME UP AND SEE ME SOME TIME” 


“COME UP AND SEE ME SOME TIME” 


“COME UP AND SEE ME SOME TIME” 


He ordered his team to stop firing, and when the smoke settled, he saw the most amazing sight he had ever seen. In all their naked glory, robots, coming to embrace them. As a police officer since creation, he had had little to know sexual encounters, as his robo penis was small and flaccid, and any relationship he had had ended when the fembot had not taken kindly to domestic abuse and/or having someone thing for them.


As he opened his arms to embrace a fembot, he cried, realising this was the happiest he’d ever been, and he had planted evidence on no less than 200 teens that were not caucasian. He was so happy, he didn’t even hear the self-destruct beeping of 100 marching fembots.

“Outstanding job, new friend.” Said Oryx as an explosion sounded behind them, who was carrying Florgo on his back to save time. The others ran alongside him as the city was wracked with explosions in the distance, news of the civil war already reaching the various factions.


“The owner of the shop used to do shady business out of the secret back entrance, but I knew it was there.” Florgo said proudly.


“Sadly, Secret Back Entrance could have been a good name for his next new sex business.” Asher smirked.


“We need to get to the spaceport, Wrath, before we have anyone else on our…” Hallgrim turned onto the main concourse and his voice faded to a whimper as he looked skyward.


Before them, descending into lower orbit, was a Velitaen assault ship, which hovered over them and trained its weapons on the group. As Wrath turned with Kellan in her arms, she came face to face with four Norn tanks that were rolling down the street towards her. This was it, they were done. With Kellan almost comatose in her arms from opening the Rift, they had no escape.


“Surrender Lady Amray to us now.” A voice announced from the lead tank.


“No chance Norn, Amray is ours.” The assault ship announced.


Wrath put Kellan on her feet, and shook her. “Kellan, you’ve got to wake up, or all these people are going to die. You might not know this, but these idiots are going to be your family one day. And if you don’t save them, you can’t do the things you’ll need to do to save Asher, Dad, and now Mum. They’ll all die and it’ll be our fault. You might think you can’t do it, kid, but I know you can. Because I believe in you more than anyone else will, I know your capabilities.” She shook Kellan again, but the kid was floppy and unresponsive. “Rook!” Wrath shouted, and Kellan woke up.


“Yeah, I fucking heard you, you nag.” Kellan said, woozy. “You didn’t kill dad?”


Wrath shook her head.


“What do you need me to do?” said Kellan, bolstered by the news.


“Rift. Get them out of here.” Wrath smiled, the tanks and ship getting closer around them.


“What about Rin and Targus? The civilians?” Kellan said, wobbling as she stood. “The war will kill them all. We can’t leave them.”


“We’re not. You are.” I’ll stay here and look after them until you can figure out how to stop this.” She took a folded piece of paper from her pocket and pushed it into Kellan’s pocket. “These are dates, I would’ve told you all about them, but I’ve run out of time now. You’re going to have to muddle through like I did. But you gotta go now.”


Kellan stood, and with every ounce of energy she had, she pulled the air around her apart. It tore in a hot vent of molten heat that singed the hair on Kellan’s arm. When the RIft was open, Asher took a last look at her older sister, and nodded. 


“I’ll look after her. I promise.” Asher said, before pushing Kellan through. Oryx, Hallgrim and Hum13 followed her with looks at Wrath. Forgo didn’t get to say if he wanted to go, as he was on Oryx’s back. Asher followed them, with a last sorrowful look back at Wrath.


“She’ll be the one looking after you.” Wrath said, as the rotary laser barrel and the tank gun tore Wrath to shreds. 


THE END
