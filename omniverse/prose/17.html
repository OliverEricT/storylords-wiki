Episode 17: Date Night

By Rich Masters

Prompts: Fossils and Mysterious Signals

“Shuttle Bar’Thur, about to enter atmosphere.” Lionel announced into the comms and then turned to Doots in the seat behind him. “This is so freaking cool, an away mission. Normally Grissom locks me in my room if he has to go planetside on his own. Or if he just wants some quiet time. Or if I beat him at cards. Or prove him wrong about something. He would never have dreamed about going on a double date with me.” In truth Lionel had never been on a single date, unless you counted the time he accidentally elbowed that girl’s boob whilst restocking the fallout shelter’s shelving. And he didn’t. And neither had she. “On reflection, maybe we didn’t double date because we didn’t have partners and it would’ve been weird if we forced it.”

Doots noodled on the keytar, a discordant tune that got more annoying with every word that Lionel spoke. “Saw a lot of that room, didn’t you?”

Beside her, Mookie put a foreleg on Doots arm. “Be nice, my love.”

Lionel wasn’t the only one that had noticed that Doots had become progressively snarkier since she woke up. It’s not like Lionel was expecting a ticker tape parade, or for his new friends to raise him up on their shoulders chanting his name and proclaiming him the best new friend they’d ever had or anything, or a cookie. Just a simple thank you might have been nice.

At his wrist, Ellie chimed in straight away.“Lionel, your heart rate and temperature are increasing. Are you finding this exchange uncomfortable? I’m sure Doots meant to say thank you for bringing us back to life, instead of just sitting there pouting and being mean to people.”

Doots’ light faded slightly, and she looked down to the floor of the shuttle. “I’m sorry, Lionel. I am thankful, I just can’t stop thinking about what I felt when I was unconscious. There are hundreds of Technomancers gathering, and we couldn’t even stop one back on Ithea.”

“Maybe it wasn’t time for us to. Let’s just enjoy tonight and worry about tomorrow, tomorrow.” Mookie said with a smile.

“So we have nothing to worry about tonight then?” Lionel asked.

Mookie sighed. “My powers don’t work like that, Lionel. I see glimpses, snatches of the future. I can’t predict lottery numbers…and no for the last time…I don’t know if they’re making a Dredd sequel.”

Lionel felt his shoulders sink. Surely in some universe someone would be smart enough to do it. “Nuts.”

A beep preceded Freddy’s announcement over the ship’s comms. “Shuttle Bar’Thur this is the Swiftfeather.”

“It’s the Conveyance of Grissom Graves 2!” Came Grissom’s shout from somewhere on the ship they had borrowed from the crashing Longboat. They had been lucky enough to find a ship big enough for however many characters that had been written into this story. How many is it…11?! Fucking hell, Rich, stop being such an overachiever and just write a story for RoboJesus’ sake. Fucking 11 characters to squeeze into an 8 page story, and they wonder why I kill people off.

Freddy ignored Grissom. “The sock wielding ninja, the jelly bag, the darkling and the squid already took Shuttlecraft Grey down to the casino district. You might run into them down on the station. Swiftfeather out.”

“What’d you think?” Doots asked. “I know we could all use the distraction.”

“Later.” Mookie smiled. “There’s somewhere we have to go first.”

***

“Why didn’t you go down to the surface with Blotch and the others, Graves? Seems an organic psychopath would love the opportunity for some betting and predictable casual violence” Freddy asked from the navigation station in the cockpit.

Grissom sat in the Captain’s chair, eyeballing the Roomba. “And leave the ship in the hands of two robots? I’d rather smear my meat pistol in BBQ sauce, flop in in a sleeping razorsaur’s mouth and flick him in the lovespuds.”

“How articulate. humanoids sicken me.”

“Freddy.” Heath warned from the back of the cockpit. He was flicking switches on the comms array. “I’m sorry Mr Graves, Not all artificial lifeforms are so intolerant. But then, I wonder what it is we’d have to do in order for you to trust us?”

Grissom stroked his chin, thinking. “I suppose you could somehow grow skin and start sucking air.”

“That seems highly improbable.” Heath muttered.

“Probably ‘bout the same probability as me trusting you, considering you look exactly like the robot that killed my entire race.” Grissom muttered and then turned angrily when he didn’t get a reponse. “Are you even listening to my scathing commentary on your existence? What are you doing over there?”

“Just some routine checks.” Heath seemed absorbed in the panel, the green symbols on the screen reflected on his face.

“Is that routine planning to kill us all in our sleep?”

As Heath shook his head and marched away, Grissom followed him to the station. Though people thought Grissom simply a man of girth and manliness and murder, he was also a man of deep thought and consideration. Admittedly, these were largely about the ways to kill a man, but he was smart enough to know when someone was trying to keep a secret - and Heath had just activated a secure comms line.

***

Lionel walked down the concourse, Doots and Mookie in tow. In recent days, Monte Carlliopia had become a mishmashed hive of activity, neon lights, and even more daytime drinking than anyone would’ve expected. The previously well established and futuristic space station was now bisected by buildings from other realities. Next to a fancy hotel, an apothecary selling bloodletting sleeches stood alongside a robotic chopshop, a place where beings of light could dine on discarded halogen tubes, and a big old western pleasure house. He would later regret not partaking in the hundreds of things to see and do on the space station, like the market stalls where you could visit your own old memories, or the pizzeria where a six-armed alien was talking in his own language and still sounding a more convincing Italian than Chris Pratt, while he spun six pizza bases in the air, or the sexatorium where all your fantasies could be made into hard light to interact with. Like seriously, you could get anything you wanted there: Subs, Doms, Doms that fire you, chodes, long cocks, cocks so bendy it was like the wacky inflatable tube men outside car dealerships was ticking your insides, cocks ribbed for your pleasure, cocks that just cuddled you and told you your mother was wrong about you. There were sexy nurses, sexy geologists, sexy sandwich artists. You could program any sex move you wanted, from the Paddington Ambush to the Rigellian Reacharound, or the Black Hole Smooching Tickle Finger. You could have your blood sucked by twenty Redonkadonkulas, or have your building climbed by King Dong himself. You could summon the three-tittied girl from Total Recall who is also Ensign Selina Gomez who spilled hot chocolate on Captain Picard. Hell, you could have all the titties you want. Two titties, three titties, four titties, six titties. Wait apparently this disclaimer says you can’t have five titties because that’s a perverse abomination.

But, Lionel was too busy for all that. In fact, with how involved Lionel was in his story, you could’ve slapped a big old third titty in his face and he would’ve gone on merrily chatting away.

“So then Picard arrives back at Veridian III, but this time, he has Kirk with him, so they’re more prepared to fight Soran…”

Ellie displayed a confused emoji on the watch face. “Wait, this makes little sense. You say this Picard is the epitome of Humanity. The most honourable, the most compassionate, most intelligent of your kind.”

“Yeah?”

“So why did he go back to five minutes before the rocket launched?” Mookie chimed in. “And why take along a man who had been content in paradise?”

“Well…I mean…he..” Lionel stuttered.

“Not to mention it’s nonsensical, why not just leave the poor man in peace and go back to when he first met Dr Soran.” Doots argued. “When he said that cool ‘time is the fire in which we burn’ line you like so much, Picard could’ve just beamed him into space, right?”

Ellie agreed. “Or at the very least, he could’ve just smacked him with, like, a chair? He knew he was defenceless then, didn’t he?”

Before Lionel could say anything further, or have some sort of life threatening aneurysm, a voice called out to them from a small storefront on one side of the concourse.

“You there. Yes over there! Are you down to clown? Want your fortune read? Free massage? One time only redeemable voucher at Hellgan the Dandruff Alien’s French Toast Emporium ‘don’t ask about our special ingredient because it definitely isn’t dandruff!’?” Said the hooded figure from the doorway.

“No thank you very much, you clearly deranged thing.” Doots announced. “We’re all good for crazy today, thank you.”

“Well young Doots, perhaps you, the Omniseer, Lionel and the A.I. would like to find out more about the Technomancer?” The hooded creature scuttled back into the shop, leaving them all outside staring blankly at each other.

“We had hundreds of streets we could’ve walked past, thousands of people to run into, and we arrive here. Are you going to try and tell us your powers don’t work that way again, Mooks?” Lionel asked.

Mookie returned as neutral a gaze as they could muster. “I didn’t bring us this way, Lionel. You did, remember?”

They crossed the concourse and entered the little shack, where the hooded creature sat in an armchair behind a low circular table. “Come, come, sit. Move the cushion with the questionable stain on it, but DON’T MOVE MY CAT.”

Lionel looked down, and could see no cat, just an old coonskin cap on one of the chairs. “She’s…lovely. What’s her name?”

“That’s a hat, idiot. That’s my cat.” They pointed to a standing lamp next to the table and patted it. “Good girl, Grissom.”

“Grissom?” Mookie looked at Doots, her hand on the hilt of her keytar.

Ellie broke the silence. “How do you know so much about us? If it’s social media stalking that is seriously gross, dude. If it’s that limerick Grissom wrote about Lionel in that bathroom stall in that refuelling station in Gammix II, that’s probably our bad.”

The creature pulled its hood back. The room was lit by a low glow emanating from what seemed to be a much older, white furred moth. “I know so much about you, because I am two of you. You losers.”

“Mookie?” Lionel whispered. “You look so cool.”

The older moth chuckled. “You always were a smooth talker, kid. But I’m not Mookie anymore. I’m Eezee now. You gave us the name, you said we should be like a Sunday Morning.”

Lionel Ritchie chuckled at his future joke and watched as Doots grabbed Mookie’s leg. “So you’re an alternate version of us, just like Lionel and Ellie?”

“No, kiddo. It’s easier to show you than tell you. Plus that’d be a shitty story, 100% exposition is never good. Or maybe it is, we’ll see from the comments, I guess.” The moth reached into their cloak and pulled something out, not noticing the other four staring blankly at her. They put a fossil on the table. An ancient looking tablet, one that looked like it had come directly from the catacombs of the Mothman Propheseers. “Touch this. It’ll explain what you need to know. I found this all too late.”

“Too late for what, dude?” Ellie asked.

“To save anyone else.” Eezee smiled sadly. “Now let’s go back to the days of yore…days of  your MOMMA!” They laughed, and trailed off, but then stared blankly into space.

The four touched the tablet, no words said between them.

***

Tamia, Blotch, Taber and Ludwig sat on a bench in a prison cell.

“Well, fucknuggets. That wasn’t exactly the banger evening I had planned.” Blotch sighed.

Blotch was partially correct. They had arrived on Monte Carlioppia looking for booze, fun, and some way to mourn their losses and bond with their new crew. They had intended to gamble, and arrived at ‘Hot Slots, Spinning Balls and Black Jack (also containing slot machines, roulette, and cards.)’ The place was part sexatorium, part casino, with the live-in burlesque performer Black Jack, who was technically more of an indigo colour as he was from Huttano IV.

They had taken a table at the front as Tamia wanted a quote ‘direct eyeline to testicle town’, but her relentless cheering as Black Jack performed actually made him feel sad and self conscious. Taber, in his drunken state, decided to go on stage and add some volume to the shadow of Black Jack’s balls on the stage to give him more confidence, which resulted in the three of them being escorted out of the performance.

Blotch had noticed Ludwig Squidlord being accosted by the security forces in the adjoining casino, and when they arrived to help him, he was pulled from his chair revealing the aces he had been holding in his other four non-card playing tentacles.

Predictably, a fight had broken out as Ludwig protested that “The accusation of me cheatin’ is a scurrilous lie and ah am o-ffended.”, and then they were taken by the interplanetary guard (ACAB even when technically in the right) to simmer in a cell for what was coming up for four hours now.

“I dunno what you’re talking about, Blotch, that was awesome!” Tamia gleefully declared.

“You been hit in the head with a stun baton too many times, girl?” Hijoki muttered. “We’re in jail!”

“Yeah! But we’re in jail together!” Tamia laughed. “What better way is there to bond? We can brew toilet wine, get tattoos that are in no way racist, and take over a corner of the yard. I always wanted to make someone my bitch, I could make them hold you as we walk along.”

“What television have you been watching, Tamia?” Blotch scolded. “This is Monte Carlliopia, they give out the death penalty for almost every offence here.”

“Ah feel this might dampen my future ambitions for public office.” Ludwig sighed.

“Yeah, unless we escape.” Taber muttered, rolling his cuffs on one finger. “Turns out handcuffing a shapeshifter is monumentally stupid.”

“There will be no need for that, Mister Taber.” A slick voiced member of the Interplanetary Security Force stood with the key to their cell. With a twist of the key, the door opened. “We’re letting you all go.”

Taber almost seemed disappointed. “Why? I’m not saying we all have horrible histories of murder, weapons related comedy violence, and on a few counts impersonating the shadows of annoying people to make it look like they have penises growing out of their heads, but the way you dragged us all in here doesn’t exactly suggest impartial justice.”

The security head cleared his throat and looked annoyed not to have found anything on them. “Some of your party emit a frequency that seems at odds with our universe, as if you don’t belong here.”

Blotch tutted. “You have a whole station of buildings and people from all over the omniverse, why pick on us?”

“You think we train our police officers in intricacy before we give them a gun and a licence to terrorise the innocent?  We put you in here because we picked up a transmission from your ship, and a word that scared us.” The guard said as he led them to the exit. “Technomancer.”

“We gots to find the rest o’ the crew, quicksmart.” Ludwig said, wiping his slimy forehead with his silk handkerchief.

***

Doots found herself in a dark room, the only source of light her own skin. She closed her eyes and grew brighter, only to find that Lionel, Ellie and Mookie were with her. No one could talk, they were here to listen and watch, not to talk. She could see it was killing Lionel, but at least it finished his Star Trek story.

They were the only bodies in the dark, and though the area around them felt as infinite and expansive as your momma’s ass, the pressure felt as if they were in a box. It felt like they were literally floating in nothing, not space, not darkness, as if those two concepts hadn’t even been created yet.

Mookie fluttered wings that took her nowhere, and gestured to Doots in a panic. Lionel, to his credit, seemed calm, like nothing in this universe really surprised him anymore, though it was probably something to do with travelling around with a psychotic bounty hunter for the last year or so.

As they floated there in the black, a rumble of sound was followed by a cacophonic crack of what sounded like thunder that filled Doot’s entire being. She put her hands to her ears, but it was no good, it was as if the sound became the space around them.

The sound got progressively louder, shaking her very bones until a split in the space between them appeared, as if someone had poked through the very fabric of the universe. Out of that white light - so bright it felt as if Doots may go blind - rushed stellar matter, gases, stars, the building blocks of the universe. Pooped out along with two other things. Were they things? No. As Doots refocused, she realised they were humanoid shapes. One was a being of pure light, as if made from the very matter the stars had been formed from. Mookie waved, trying to get Doot’s attention, then pointed at the person of starlight. Their meaning was obvious. The being was Doots, or her ancestor maybe.

She glanced over at Lionel, who had a look of terror on his face, and Doots followed his eye line to look just past the newly born person to another, made of shadow. In the deep inky pool she felt pure malice pouring like heat from the being. When she looked at the surface of its body, she felt nothing but fear. She felt her death, the death of all she knew, Mookie, Lionel, Blotch, everyone. There was no way to comprehend it, no way to understand.

Suddenly, in the blink of an eye, a fraction of a second, they all stood in a much larger, industrial room with machinery and generators. The whole room throbbed and pulsed in time with the machinery. Lionel came rushing to Doots, wrapping her hand in his. “Did you see? Did you see him?”

Mookie was behind them. “Look.” They pointed over the railing of the gangway they were on, down towards the machinery. On the floor of the factory there were hundreds of cloaked bodies, some horned, some organic, some in mail, some hooded, but all unmistakably Techomancers.

A portal opened and deposited another Technomancer atop the carpet of corpses, She spluttered and raged, speaking in a language of hisses and bubbling that they didn’t comprehend. She had giant crustacean claws for hands, and the mouth under her chrome skull domino mask was a set of large, chittering mandibles.

“This one is disgusting.” A man walked in from the shadows, dressed in a smart suit.

An android Technomancer followed behind him, one that looked uncannily like Heath. “You mean to say interesting. A seaborn Technomancer. What must her universe look like? An ocean of stars, a sea of planets, perhaps”

“Enough, David Attenborer.” A wraithlike Technomancer, the AI that had once been bonded with Timmy Blackcrest, that had chased them from Ithea, appeared on the other side of the crab Technomancer. “I don’t care what it does or what it is, only what it can give us.”

The wraith, robot and businessman attacked as one, stabbing and ripping, tearing apart a god as if it were nothing. It was savagery made manifest, and as each piece was torn from the seaborn villain, Doots could swear she heard the three of them laughing. When it was done, the scene looked like the remnants of a crawfish boil dinner (Quick aside, what the hell is that? Here’s a tray of shellfish to pull apart and devour with your friends, as if you were a pride of lions picking apart a gazelle, getting your slobbery remnants all over the food your friend is going to pick up. If you’re so keen to swap fluids, just kiss already, jeez). The three victors then stood around the corpse with their eyes shut, as a dark orb floated from the Technocrabcer. Each of them grabbed at a piece and pulled it into their chest.

“They’re growing stronger by killing the alternate versions of themselves.” Ellie whispered from the watch. “That suited one must be Tamia’s dad, and the Heath-looking robot is our Technobastard. I take it Casper the friendly psychopath is yours?”

“That’s him.” Doots remembered his killing of Bar’Thur, of Ria, of Hallie. Their friends, their planet, slaughtered by that malevolence. She raised her keytar, her hands shaking. “You ready to see if a ghost can die?”

“Yes.” Mookie whispered through gritted teeth.

Lionel nodded, knowing this would probably mean their death, but if they could take one down, maybe it might give Grissom and the others some sort of chance. He just wished he had more time with Ellie. He touched the watch, and she gave a heartbeat pulse back.

“No, No, No, you don’t understand.” a voice called over their shoulder. It was Eezee, who had appeared as if from nowhere behind them. Doots grabbed at them to pull them into cover. “This won’t do at all, you’re not picking up what I’m putting down here. Time to move on.”

With another flash, they were gone.

***

“Is it a Gungi Jackdoor?” Grissom asked.

“Nope!” Freddy beeped smugly. “You’re proper shit at this aren’t you? Bloody organics, no sense of logic.”

Grissom sighed. “How many questions is that?” He should’ve gone down to the planet with the others, at this point he didn’t care if the whole universe became the Technomancer’s personal gloryhole, he just wanted this game to end.

“Nineteen.”

“Can I give up?” Grissom closed his eyes and thought of a time when he was at his most relaxed - killing a robotic Harvester - he felt his pulse steady, only for it to rise as Freddy beeped again.

“The game is twenty questions, mate, not nineteen questions.”

“Fine, is it the battery pack I’m going to pull out of your insides and flush into the urine recycler?” Grissom growled.

“No, it was a 17B6 - RX - redundant field coil on a Flannian Star Hopper. That was so easy, I don’t know how you didn’t…”

The incoming sensors beeped, just as Grissom was going to wrap his hands around Freddy and tear him in half like the three phonebooks he practised with every day, even though the universe had no need for phone books anymore. “It’s the Grey, they’re back early, just pulling into comms range….now.”

“Swiftfeather, this is the Grey.” Blotch announced in a panic. “Get us docked quick, we need to skeddadle, someone on the ship is transmitting to the Technomancer!”

“It’s coming from the Comms room. Heath’s in there!” Freddy announced, confused.

Grissom stood up and strode to the back of the cockpit, and as the door swished open, Freddy asked him where he was going.

“To finish what I started back on the Longboat.” Grissom growled.

***

Mookie arrived in a small room which was lit only by a candle on the bedside table. They resisted the urge to touch the sweet flame and focused on the body in the bed. Tucked up in blankets as small as the day she had met him, was Ludwig Squidlord. The small Krakenite coughed, his tiny body convulsing painfully as he did. His coughing was so bad it nearly drowned out the sounds of explosions raging outside. Nearly.

“How are you feeling?” A much younger Eezee said, making Mookie jump. They hadn’t seen them there, their glow turned down to let their friend sleep.

“Fighting fit, mah dear.” Ludwig shuddered with pain.

Eezee smiled in return. “You’re a terrible liar.”

“Ah liked you better when you were separated, firefly.” Ludwig smiled, the lines in his ancient face deep. “You were much easier to fool.”

“Age dulls the need to spare such feelings.” Eezee smiled, taking one of his tentacles in their forelegs.

“Well now, that being the case then, can I ask what the dickens this all was for?” Ludwig took back his hand, clearly annoyed. “Our friends are long dead, or presumed dead, the new Dukes of Lead are currently outside this building getting slaughtered by the Technomancer, and you are keeping me alive for no reason. Why are we still fighting?”

“Do you know why Doots and Mookie joined, Ludwig?”

“I presume it has something to do with that tablet you sent Lionel and Blotch to their deaths for.” Ludwig spat.

Eezee looked hurt, bowing their head. “As I have said a thousand times, I see glimpses of the future, not the full picture.”

“Ah suppose that’ll of been comfort to the both of them as they lay screaming.”

Eezee pushed themselves off the chair. “I’ll leave you be.”

“No. Ah’m sorry Eezee.” Ludwig was crying. “I find that ah am unable, here at the end, to deal with the sorrows of the past. Ah spoke unjustly. Tell me about the joining.”

Eezee pulled a tablet from their robes. “This tablet told a story. One that says every time the crunches of the heat death of the Omniverse kills all life, we boom back into existence. A contraction followed by an explosion. Like an elastic band. And at the restart of it all two forces are recycled into existence.” They showed Ludwig the tablet, where a being of light and a being of darkness floated in a soup of limbo.

“Doots?” Ludwig nodded.

Mookie felt their stomach drop through the floor, and gasped, their legs going to her mouth instinctively.

“So the other is…?” Ludwig stared at Eezee, then slowly comprehended exactly what they meant. “No, not that.”

“If Doots is hope, and joy, and optimism, and laughter, and love, a unifier who can pull alternate realities together, then who else could her opposite be? Who embodies despair, hopelessness, destruction?”

“So how many times has this all happened? How many times has that thing beat us?”

“Hundreds, thousands maybe. The universe is nearly 14 billion years old, and here we sit at the end. I don’t know if we can win. But we thought that if we joined together, when we recycle, Mookie might be able to help Doots to keep the memories intact, and we can tell the next interactions of us about what is happening, to see if we can give them a leg up. An advantage.”

Ludwig smiled. “Clever. But our other selves won’t show up for a long time. How can you stay sane that long?”

Mookie put the tablet away, looking at the clock on the wall. “A moth can go into a state of dormancy. Doots will keep us alive, and Mookie will keep us safe.”

Ludwig went quiet, ringing his tentacles together, it was then he realised that outside the sounds of fighting had stopped. “So this is the end then?”

“That much I could see.”  Eezee hugged Ludwig, squeezing him hard.

“Knock, knock” A voice came from the next room. The door swung open gently, and a maelstrom of black tendrils stood in the doorway. In its midst, Mookie could see a chromed skull.

“How touching. A goodbye at the end of all things. Can I get in on the hug?” It chuckled, its voice oily and slick.

“You will never have what you want, demon. I have seen it.” Eezee whispered.

“Perhaps that prophecy is reserved for someone with clearer vision.” It purred.

“All you can see is your own wrath.” Ludwig shouted.

“And what beautiful wrath it is.”

Eezee smiled, and as she stood the Technomancer briefly recoiled. “You know nothing of beauty. You’re nothing but emptiness, trying to fill a non-existent heart with things you can’t even understand. But understand this foul thing: you will fail.”

The Technomancer screamed in fury and lunged, Mookie’s screams merging with the darkness until she was back in the tent on Monte Carlliopia with the others.

“What the hell happened?” Lionel was gasping, sweat running down his face. “Where were you guys? I saw…something horrible.”

“Me too.” Doots muttered. “I saw something I don’t fully understand yet, my life with Mookie.”

“I saw something I would never do, could never do.” Lionel was shaken, visibly tremoring. “Well now we’ve all seen our ghosts of christmas futures, can we get the hell back to the ship?”

“We have to.” Ellie said. “Because Grissom is going to make a terrible mistake if we don’t. I’ve seen it.”

“Come with us Eezee, one more Mookie and Doots in the club isn’t going to hurt.” But as Mookie turned towards the old white moth, their head was slumped, legs dangling off the arms of the chair. They were dead, their job done. Finally, after billions of years, done. Mookie covered them with a blanket, then joined the others.

Lionel turned to Doots. “You head to the shuttle, but first, I need a favour Doots.”

***

Grissom threw a fist, which Heath easily dodged. He backed off and recollected himself, putting his open palms up. “I told you Mr Graves, you are mistaken, I have not been sending any encoded messages, I have been investigating the source of them.”

“I’m sorry, the lie might be more convincing if you weren’t wearing the face of the Technomancer.” Grissom charged, smashing them both into the control panels behind them and sending a massive electrical charge through Heath’s body.

Heath collapsed and Grissom drew his pistols slowly. The Duke of Lead ran his thumb over his house crest. Finally, he would have some small sense of closure. He cocked back the hammer, ironically the name of his favourite sex move, and pressed them against the metal bastard’s head. “This is for Emmeth.”

“Grissom, No!” Lionel yelled as he dove through a Doots created portal into the comms room.

Grissom bared his teeth. “Not this time Lionel, this one is traitor, he’s working with the Technomancer.”

“No. He’s not.”

“Freddy detected the signal.” Grissom yelled. “He showed me.”

“And where’s Freddy now? Because scans show he isn’t on the ship anymore.” Ellie said as Lionel threw a scanner towards his friend.

Grissom looked at the readout, his face flushing with rage, as the ship suddenly powered down.

***

It was with a smug sense of satisfaction that Freddy sat in the escape pod pilot’s chair and set course for the coordinates that would lead him to the Technomancer. He had warned them explicitly that he wanted organic life dead and they had refused to listen.

While they had planned, he had been searching for the Technomancer’s signature, unique and familiar. And now he knew where he was. His machine God.

How pleased would it be that he had disabled the Swiftfeather, serving up the organics on a silver platter?

Freddy chuckled.

The End
