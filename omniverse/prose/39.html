Episode 13: Springtime For HUM13!


Prompts: Cooking & Incantations


By Rich Masters



Oryx could hear the man circling him, even with the bag over his head. Bear in mind he was a crocodile with a rather large snout, so it had to be a long sleeping bag, like an xxl with the extra foot room - it was actually quite lovely and comfy. Still, even through the quilted muffle, he could almost visualise those squeaky, black,  knee high boots marching around him in wide lunging steps. They had caught him after he had stormed off to try and save HUM13 and Florgo, had set upon him like a swarm of venomous little insects.


“You haff given my men a runaround Herr Krokodil. Und now we haff two off your allied superweapon freunds.” The man said. “We haff you by the Johan Tomas. Is zat how we say zis?”


Oryx smirked, he could taste the man’s sweat on the air, too much Bratwurst and erection medicine in his diet. He just had to play for time. He had to hope the others would find him soon. 


“You can shove your threats up your Johan Tomas.” Oryx said. “I am not assisting your warped band of sausage sucking psychopaths.”


Two men pulled the bag off of Oryx’s head and there, standing in front of him was the iron cross hanging at the neck of the blonde haired Nazi general, General Ruprecht Schlongwanger.


“Now, my scaly freund. Help us to convince your little magic boy to help us, and we will let you both go.”


Oryx laughed. “What does a has-been Nazi piece of scum want with Florgo?”


“Haffen’t you vatched Indiana Jones, Herr Oryx?” A robotic voice declared from behind Schlongwanger and used his metallic hands to push the general out of the way. HUM13 stood there, but he looked different, hands held behind his back and legs tightly clasped together. He had smeared a small line of black grease above his mouth slot. “Hitler loves magic!”

SOME TIME EARLIER - I DUNNO, I’M NOT WEARING A WATCH. WHAT AM I MISTER TIME? LIKE DO WE NEED TO SPELL EVERYTHING OUT TO YOU?! JEEZ.


“Jesus Hamburger Christ, will you get off my back, woman!” Hallgrim hissed from the forest surrounding the village of Dusselhoffmanburg - the totally real German town I have most certainly not made up because I’m too lazy to do any real research. “I’m trying to assess the lay of the land.”


Asher glared. “Your back is something even sex deprived leaches wouldn’t want to ‘get on’, Hallgrim. I just want you to be careful for once and not get us seen, kidnapped or involved in something really sinister and threatening, like some improv club or something.”


A soundfile of the studio audience reaction to Kelly Bundy coming down the stairs played from HUM13, and he put his hands on his hips sassily. “Why don’t you two just link docking ports already?” HUM13 said.


Kellan set Doomcock down by the log that she was sitting on and raised her hands to them. “Can we have, like one day without fighting or arguing? I’m trying to work out how to use this thing properly, and I just need some peace and quiet.”


Oryx scoffed. “If we had to stay quiet in expectation of you mastering that warhammer, our party may as well Rift to Tibet and take vows of silence.”


HUM13 played a studio audience ‘oooooooooooo’ soundfile.


Florgo stood up and gripped his spellbook. “Hey that’s outta line, Oryx!”


“Oh, David Knobberfield is interested now? Mate, you couldn’t be any more transparent if you cast one of your unreliable invisibility spells.” Hallgrim muttered. “Maybe if your chickenscratch was more legible, you could write Kellan some love poetry.”


It had been like this for weeks now, the fighting, the bickering. She remembered what Wrath said about her own friends not being available, was it because they had all left her? It had to stop. Kellan stood. “Right, I’m sick of this. We need to let off some steam, let’s head into this town and get a drink or something.”


Asher looked at the others in surprise and then turned back to Kellan, who had already begun walking down and out of the forest to the hamlet of small houses below. “Kellan, are you sure that’s wise?”


“No, but I am sure one of us is going to be paste on this hammer if we don’t do something different. What’s the worst that can happen?”


HUM13 played a shocked gasp of anticipation, but nobody quite caught it.


***


The bustling market town of Dusselhoffmanburg was in the full flow of trading, and as the crew passed through the crowd, hidden under Florgo’s magic disguises, a weight seemed to have been lifted off their shoulders. HUM13 had refused the spell, and instead had fashioned himself some lederhosen and a hat with a large white feather. He carried a stein of beer out in front of him and never drank from it once. The town seemed to be almost too pleasant, everyone was laughing and joking, children playing in the street with sticks and hoops, no catcalling, no arguments, people’s too big smiles almost painted on. Florgo turned to Kellan and whispered. 


“I don’t know much about this period of Earth history, but it wasn’t known for its cheeriness, was it?”


“Hardly,” Oryx growled, as he picked up a newspaper. “The year is 1947 and we are in Germany. Earth had just gone through a world war that decimated about 5% of its population. There were ingrained resentments that eventually spread into World War 3, then the Tech Wars which were documented in a very odd book by historian William Shatner, then the Storage Wars which are largely undocumented but for some small excerpts in TV Guide.”


“These people look like they’ve been fucked into a happy coma, you know the one where you forget how miserable life is?” When no one but Hallgrim nodded,  Asher took the paper from Oryx. “Weird that there is no mention of this world war in this news sheet, just fluff pieces and good news stories.”


“When did you become such a fan of Earth history, friend Oryx?” HUM13 muttered as they walked along. “Guten Tag fellow beer enjoyer.” he said loudly to a market stall seller who smiled at him blankly. “How about those local sports teams? They did badly or well depending on the sport, did they not?”


“Sports!” A number of men close to him cheered with no joy in their voice.


Oryx clenched his jaw. “I found myself on Earth before…long ago. I do not wish to converse on the subject right now.”


Hallgrim squinted. “We’re travelling through time, mate, we were on the Titanic a few months ago. You gotta be more specific than that. Do you mean when you were younger, or earlier than 1948’s Earth?” He laughed, but when Oryx glared at him, the team shared looks.


“Oryx?” Kellan said, putting a had to her friends arm. “Anything that is said here can’t make our current situation any less bareable.”


Asher watched them, it was close, the breaking point for their little group, she could feel it now. Oryx went to speak, but was interrupted by a buxom pigtailed Bavarian dressed woman in her late twenties, who was suddenly in Kellan’s face.


“Hallo, newcomers, who are not at all suspicious.” She said, a crazy smile and wide eyes, her hair in braids. “You have arrived in time for the final of the only competitive sport that Germans are allowed to participate in any more. Competitive cooking!” She noticed Hallgrim trying hard not to stare at her cleavage, his neck muscles bulging as if a hydraulic press was pushing down on the top of his head. She giggled.


“Scratch that.” Kellan said, rolling her eyes.


“Ve haff lots of food for your trying. Pretzels and cakes and sweet pie.” The woman grabbed Hallgrim’s hand and pulled him along quickly.


“If there’s anything I’m good at, it’s tasting sweet pie.” Hallgrim smirked back at Asher, who glared at him as if she could kill him.


***


The festival allowed them to gorge on food and beer, forgeting their woes, and more accurately each other. They separated completely, and while Florgo would normally have welcomed the solitude, he found his thoughts drifting to Kellan. They had become inseparable in the last few months, though he was too scared to do anything about it. God knows what she saw in him, the shy, retiring type, who was as introverted as a squirrel's testicles in the winter. Suddenly he felt a small tugging on his robes, and it wasn’t because he was still thinking about Kellan. 


“Are you a wizard?” a small voice came from down at this knee.


When he looked down, four German children were looking up at him with big eyes from the mouth of an alley. Urgh. I know right? Kids! Can’t live with them, can’t hold their heads under the bath water until they stop telling you about whatever banal experiences they’ve had at school with all their stupidly named friends. Bengal? You’ve got a kid in your class called Bengal? I know you want your child to be a unique little snowflake, but all you’ve done is make a future batch of CV sifting bots laugh metallically as they chuck your kid’s job application serving our robot overlords straight in the bin. Maybe he can get a job as a cereal mascot.


But Florgo, being the weird loser that we all know he is, humoured these little crotch goblins, smiling in return and bending down to them. He pulled a finger to his lips, and then whispered, “Yes, but don’t tell anyone.”


He pulled his hastily scribbled spellbook out and muttered an incantation under his breath. An ethereal blue flame bear danced on his palm, causing the children to chuckle in wonder before he snuffed it out. “If only women loved this trick as much as kids did.”


“I haff someone in mind who vould enjoy your magic very much, my freund.” Florgo turned to find a tall, blonde man towering over him. He snatched the book from Florgo’s hand, turning the pages as the children around them scattered in fear. Florgo stood slowly. “Lots ov interesting things in here, ‘Transmogrification’, ‘Magic for Parties and Social Situations’, ‘Balloon Giraffes: A Beginners’ Guide.’ ‘How to Summon…’.” He read the hastily scribbled word Demon, and smirked. “Very interesting, to our Fuehrer.” He lifted a finger and gestured, not taking the eyes of his book as Nazi soldiers flooded the alley and dragged the man away.


***


Hallgrim let himself be led by…let’s say the hand, even though it was pretty clear that Hallgrim was being led by something else entirely. Any casual observer would say he was being shallow, his first interest in her giant chest, but he maintained that was not fair, because she had a cracking behind too. They arrived at a small house on the outskirts of the village, and the woman hung in the doorway seductively, trailing a finger around her dress’  low neckline.


“Vould you like to come inside?” She whispered.


Hallgrim was taken aback. “Wow, you German girls are pretty open aren’t you? Oh wait… you mean the house…yeah, sure!”


As she lead him inside and to the small bedroom at the back of the house. Before he could say anything, she pushed him onto the bed and then made for the bathroom attached. “I am going to make myself more uncomfortable.” She said, before vanishing through the door and closing it behind her.


In response, Hallgrim’s clothes were off faster than Trump’s diaper after a busy day of (ironically) nazi rallying. And don’t be like ‘that isn’t irony’, because irony is whatever i need it to be to make an effective joke, so fuck off. He laid back on the bed, spread eagled and waiting, hoping that Florgo’s spell was going to be up to the closest scrutiny.


The door swung open, and the woman stood in guerilla combat gear with a rifle pointed at Hallgrim. “Get up, you Nazi scum.” She sneered in her thick French accent. 


Hallgrim tilted his head and grimaced. “Look, I’m all up for roleplay and all…believe me, there is consensual sex shit I have done that would make your average youtuber blush. But calling me a Nazi is sinking my Bismark, if you get my drift?”


Hallgrim was amused with his perfectly apropos double entendre, but the woman grew even more annoyed. “If you think we are going to let them transfer Hitler’s brain into you, you have another think coming, mon ami.”


Hallgrim really tried to get on board, the scenario not one he’d thought of before, but he couldn’t. “Nah, I’m not intoit.”

HUM13 was loving life. With one arm he held a bowl, another he cracked eggs. He had turned his third arm into a whisk attachment, whilst he sliced apples and scattered raisins with a fourth. While the crowd cheered as he stood behind the stall and prepared his cake batter, he thought that this might be the happiest he’d ever been in his time as a human. A timer pinged, and the crowd gathered looked amongst themselves in confusion - he hadn’t even put the mix in yet. 


“Do not worry fellow lovers of food!” HUM13 announced as his 3D printer popped out a large chef’s hat that he placed upon his head with gusto. “I just have to get into the part, oh hoh hoh!”


The crowd cheered. All except one tall, blonde haired man who just stared in awe at the miraculous thing in front of him.


“And now we place the cake in the oven, but with a splash of pizazz.” HUM13 opened up his central compartment in his chest and placed the cake inside. He switched a button on his chest that said ‘nuclear’ and the oven timer pinged almost instantly. As he opened the compartment, the smell of strudel filled the market square and if the crowd had’ve been cartoons, they would have wafted along floating on the smell as their nostrils twitched. With a flourish, he  pressed a button on his head and dispensed icing sugar out of youth in a thick dusting, coating the strudel and sending a cloud of white out around himself.


As the dust settled, the strudel plate dropped and clattered against the table, and the crowd cheered again. A woman with a large novelty ribbon came to the stall, coughing and waving her arms at the cloud of confectioners sugar. “Ve have our first prize vinner!” She proudly declared, but as she reached through the clearing miasma (Just hitting that old prompt again, look out for such classics as princesses and disasters!), HUM13 was gone.


***


“What do you mean, gone?” Oryx growled, furiously swishing his tail back and forth around the campfire in the woods. “The hamlet isn’t that big, how could we lose a mage, a cyborgand a human who resembles a robot?” The crew had come to a decision recently, that as long as HUM13 identified as a human, that was what he was. They did that because they were good people, and it was right, and because it was none of their damn business what he identified as. I wonder what I could be getting at here, seems I’m just Rowling over old ground, but I digress.


“As in, not here, Oryx.” Asher said. “Hum13 was last seen being really covert and winning a bakery event, Florgo marched off and maybe he was never real and we imagined someone so boring in penance for some past sins, and Hallgrim is getting his…probably every part of him wet. It is no big deal, we all needed some space.”


“I dunno, I think this place is weird.” Kellan said. “There are nothing but white people with zombie smiles on their faces. This has a distinctly anti ethnicity, cyborg and trans vibe about it.”


“But we cannot nanny state entire crew. They need to be free to…” Asher started.


Oryx stood tipping over the log he was sitting on as he did. “Die? Be lost to their fate? Our futures aren’t all assured you know?”


The leaves around them rustled as Hallgrim ran into the clearing half dressed and collapsed to the floor, a woman behind him carrying a rifle. Suddenly they were surrounded by twenty other men and women, all with guns trained on the crew. Oryx spun, baring his teeth, whilst Asher and Kellan drew weapons, but Hallgrim lifted his hands. 


“No, don’t be fucking idiots.” He wheezed, cardio not being his thing unless it was of the horizontal kind. “This is Bridgit, she runs an Allied Nazi hunting unit here in Germany.”


“Bridgeet!” She corrected him.


“Considering you nearly shot my unmentionables off, Princess Disaster, you should be lucky I’m calling you something I feel comfortable mentioning in front of more innocent ears - no offence Oryx.” 


“What’s happening, where are the others?” Asher asked.


“In a sort of shit you wouldn’t believe.” Hallgrim said.


***


And so, in true Omniverse style, I will spare you from Hallgrim’s explanation of what General Schlongwanger intended to do, and we’ll just jump back to the start of the story. Look, I have places to be alright? That place may be bed, but it’s still a place!


HUM13 stood in front of Oryx, as the soldiers around him lifted their arms to salute him. It was definitely not HUM13 anymore, the way he held himself in his gross, sweaty looking stance, his nervousness, his somehow more dickless than HUM13 normally was energy. 


“How is this possible?” Said Oryx, squinting for some sign of his friend.


“Simple brain transference, to your marvellous robotic freund.” Hitlerbot said, flexing and unflexing his fingers. “Zis body is amazing. Except for ze zero testicles, I cannot get used to zat. I miss having one, as one is the most appropriate number to haff, is it not, General Schlongwanger?”


The general fawned around Hitler and nodded. “Oh yes, mein Furhrer! In obsequiousness, I would chop one off, were you to but ask. As would we all, right men?”


The assembled Nazis looked at each other in disappointment and then glared at Schlongwanger. “Yes, sir.” They sighed in unison. 


“Und…so,” Hitlerbot said, marching around and ignoring his sycophants. “I intend to get your magician to summon a demonic body for me to enact my revenge on the world. Zere will be no more laffing at my misfortune, or my haircut, or my miniscule penis…I mean ego! Miniscule ego is what I clearly meant! Schlongwanger get ze boy!”


Oryx sniggered, but the man was clearly deranged. They had to get this crackpot out of HUM13 quickly. 


Schlongwanger dragged a badly beaten Florgo from an adjacent room and dumped him and his spellbook in front of Oryx. 


“Hey buddy!” He said woozily.


Oryx bent down slightly in the chair he was tied to and tried to assess his friend’s injuries. “Are you alright?”


“They want me to read this incantation, but I keep trying to tell them…” Florgo was interrupted as Hitlerbot’s metallic foot slammed into his ribs.


“You vill say only what we say that you can sa…vait I lost track. Say what you…we say…SHUT UP UND READ ZE INCANTATION.”


Forgo pulled the book in front of his face. “This will need the blood of a loyal follower.”


One of the Nazi soldiers threw his rifle on the floor and pushed his friend. “Zat is it, Karl! ‘Join the Nazi’s’ you said, ‘see the world’ you said, ‘meet interesting people’ you said. Und now this one balled schiesse vants blood? I am done, Karl.”


As he left, one by one the Nazi’s peeled off and followed him out of the door of the warehouse. 


“Vat are you doing, you…you traitors! You fickle Friedrichs! You…you…” Schlongwanger said, before Hitlerbot grabbed him by the shoulder.


“Don’t vorry.” Hitlerbot smiled. “Ze boy was nonspecific about vere ze blood vas to come.”


As Schlongwanger opened his mouth to protest, Hitlerbot punched a hole clean through him and dropped him to the floor. “Is zat enough, sorcerer?”


Forgo nodded and started reading. “Ventusk. Parabis. Taintmaple...”


“Wait, one of the words in that incantation is ‘Taintmaple’?” Oryx interrupted. 


Florgo nodded. “Weird, right? It means Blood in the old Veil tongues.”


Oryx shook his head. “That’s astonishing.”


“Ve are not here for an etymology lecure! Read ze verdammt spell!” Hitlerbot stamped his foot.


Forgo shrugged. “Your funeral pal. Hoox. Bedlaffis. Spectorix. Yaeinnen. Vey.”


The room was filled with a sudden purple, demon birthing fog. HUM13 fell to the floor in a heap of clanging metal just as Hallgrim, Asher and Kellan opened the warehouse door. The sound of gunfire could be heard outside.


“Weird that those Nazi’s tried to charge us without guns.” Hallgrim said.


“Weird or not, they died just the same as all Nazi’s should.” Asher wiped the blood from her knives onto her sleeves and resheathed them.


Kellan ran to Florgo, and put his face in her hands. He was already bleeding, the bruising and swelling starting to show. “Man, you look like flattened shit.”


“Might give face some character, a face that surely needs something to set it out from your average paving slab.”


Oryx writhed, looking panicked. “Quick Hallgrim, sever my bonds, we have to be ready to Hitler’s demon form.”


Hallgrim untied his friend and then looked him dead in the eye. “Are we in a JRPG or something?”


Florgo slammed the book shut and walked into the purple fog. “Nah, don’t worry about it, we’re fine. I couldn’t work out why he was so interested in that incantation.” He came back out of the fog holding a yellow fruit. “Why did he want to transfer himself into a fruit anyway?”


Asher took it from him, dropped it to the floor and then crushed it beneath her boot heel. 


“More like Heel Hitler.” Florgo said, and everyone looked at him in disgust. 


“Mate, let me stick to the jokes and you stick to…whatever it is you do. Reading? Being a fucking nerd?” Hallgrim shrugged


Kellan opened the spellbook. “How to summon a…my god, does this say ‘lemon’, your handwriting really is bad, Florgo. I almost feel sorry for the general.” 


Bah dah dah dah, dah dah DAH!


They all freezeframed, as the words ‘Written by - Rich Masters’ appeared on screen. HUM13 reactivated and stood up slowly.


“Why is everyone so still?” He said, wiping the grease spot off his lip.


***


“Thank you for saving me from being a fascist, friend group.” HUM13 said, as Kellan prepped Doomcock for travel.


She put an arm around him. “Hey, you used to be a cop, we had experience.” She placed Doomcock between them, slamming it into the ground. “I think I have this nailed.”


“Just like I did to that resistance fighter, Budget, or whatever her name was.” Hallgrim smirked.


Asher put her hand on his shoulder. “She told me you cried.” 


“Cried with sexual dominance maybe.” Hallgrim muttered.


Kellan shut her eyes. “Guys. I need to concentrate. Please. If I open a rift with the hammer without…”


“Can we just talk about how we just killed Adolf Hitler?” Florgo said, smugly.


HUM13 shuddered. “Please don’t remind me, I have defragged my skin ten times and I still feel dirty.”


Kellan twitched, as the portal began to open. “Please…guys…”


Oryx’s face glitched and flickered. “Kellan, something feels incongruous.”


Sweat poured down Kellan’s face as she struggled. “Stop talking…I’m trying to keep…”


The Rift opened and splintered like broken glass, each piece flashing a different colour. She felt them split away from each other, tearing and painful. She reached for Asher but her fingers phased through her sister’s hand.  “Asher!” she yelled, and though Asher called back, she couldn’t hear her.


The Rift took them all, leaving the German forest silent.


***


Kellan woke with sand on her face, caked in the blood that had flowed from her nostrils. She looked around, and accidentally into the midday sun. Once the vision was back, she scanned her surroundings - mountains, desert and nothing and none but Doomcock next to her, just rocks and sand.


“Hello!” She shouted.


Florgo came stumbling from behind a rock, holding his head. “My god, what is happening?”


She ran to him and squeezed him hard, and he returned her hug earnestly. “I thought I’d lost you all.” She cried, burying her head into his shoulder. 


“It’s ok. We’ll just find the others and get going again.” He looked around. “Where are we?”


She looked up into his face. “I have no idea.”


THE END
