Episode Eight - The Mas-Que-Flayed Ball

Prompts: Masks & Autopsies

“Last one of the night.” Mortician Karjo sighed as he brought in the black, shiny hover pod with the latest victim inside. He was tired, it had been a longer shift than that time that gigantic sentient mech had mistaken the ringed Blue Raven asteroid base of Draken III for a giant metallic vagina.  “Same deal, readout says classic space asphyxiation.”

“This is the sixth desiccated crew Admiral Ivy’s ‘salvage’ teams have brought in this month!” Mortician Rhynox (note to self to check later and definitely before reading live: is this a pokemon?) pulled a gold filling from the dead man he has been performing the autopsy on and rubbed his grey, crinkled forehead. “Are they trying to get caught? They need to start simulating other reasons for death - A hyperdrive breach, or a laser fight, or a telepathically transmitted STI or something. Garlan blue balls, or black-holenorrhea, or the Milky Way Mud Dumpers, something like that.”

Karjo straightened, all the blood draining from his face. “Don’t criticise the Admiral’s methods! Don’t you know what happened to the last guy?”

Rhynox thought for a second, wiping his bloody scalpel down his scrubs and pushing the finished body into the slab in the wall. “Was that the one that became a plastic surgeon because he wanted to work on sweet cans all the time?”

“Well yes, Dr Funbags did leave of his own accord.” Karjo nodded. “But I meant Dr Dykstra. She started to query the Blue Ravens and then she vanished pretty quick.”

“Yeah, she went off to get those sweet chesticles from Doc Funbags.” Rhynox shook his head, annoyed by the young colleague.

“No! the one befor…”

The two morticians stopped talking and stared at each other as a sudden thudding bagan to emanate from the hover pod Karjo had just brought in. Rhynox investigated the side panel of the pod and shrugged, the status bar showing nothing abnormal - no life signs. The thudding became more intense, more rhythmic, a small pounding on the inside. “Idiots must have sent us a defective pod. It’ll stink to high heavens in there.”

He hit the release, and then bent down as a gust of stale air as violent as a Taco Bell fart hissed from the open pod . “My god, it smells like sweaty socks in there!”

Suddenly, a white sports sock jutted out from the opening to come face-to-seam with the slack-jawed doctor. “Who’re you calling sweaty, you pasty-faced lizard?”

A throbbing hum sounded from the pod, and a red luminous sword shot from inside to create a kebab of the doctor, the blade going in and out of each ear and presumably going through his brain, he’s an alien I just made up, his brain could be in his butt for all you know.

“Don’t be xenophobic, Hijoki! And you think it’s bad out there, butt-brain (see, it’s lore now, don’t question it), try being inside here with him for 8 hours. Oh wait, you can’t answer, you're dead.” A woman sighed as she pushed the lid off the pod she’d been lying in. She wore a fox kabuki mask over the upper half of her face, and a dark bodysuit lined with crimson edging. In her free hand she held a katana made of cracking red energy, that thrummed in a low drone. On her other hand, the sports sock stood proud. Karjo had heard of these two, the ex-Blue Raven Salvager, Tamia Santo and her sock companion, Captain Hijoki of the Clan of the Photonic Blades, he thought expositionally.

As she swung her legs out of the pod and walked towards Karjo, he backed up on his hands and knees, crawling away as fast as he could.

“Hold on there, bucko.” The woman said as she took a step forward, before her momentum abruptly halted. The sword was stuck in the late mortician’s cranium, the flesh cauterised and stuck to the energy blade, and she was struggling dragging his weight across the floor.

“Head, girl. The head.” The sock on her hand seemed to be annoyed. “We’ve got a good entrance going here.”

The woman pulled a smaller blade from her belt and hacked at the dead man’s neck, great fountains of grey blood sluicing from the growing wound as she chopped through with a series of sickening hacks.

“Had a good entrance.” The sock shook its head.

“Look, It’s tough, alright?” She hissed at her own hand. “I don’t have much upper body strength and this guy’s neck is thicker than Thiccy Twerklington, the Regent of Roundmoundonia.”

Her narrowed eyes set on Karjo, the mask she wore covered in grey blood. With her free hand, she lifted the sword, the face of Dr Rhynox staring at him. “I don’t particularly like grave robbers, people like you killed my parents. But you see, my pal Hijoki here was killed during a Blue Raven raid. Thankfully, Photonic Bladers can transfer their consciousness, but he could only go into this sock. As you can imagine, he’s even more tetchy.”

“Some might say, furious as all fuck.” The sock got in the mortician’s face. “Where are the crew of the Setting Sun?”

Karjo started breathing heavily, knowing that the information he was about to relay was going to get him decapitated. “The Setting Sun crew were processed over a month ago.”

The last thing Karjo saw was the surprised face of Dr Rhynox hurtling towards him, and then the last things he felt were warm blood leaking at his neck and warm piss leaking at his groin.

“Listen, Hijoki, I know you’re going to be pissed…” Tamia started as she took her kabuki mask off and wiped the blood splatters on her suit. They had discussed whether the use of the mask was cultural appropriation, but Hijoki had decided that since they shared the same body effectively, that she was kinda mixed species.

“Do us both a favour and put the mask back on will you?” The sock/samurai master whispered, trying to contain his rage and his garment shape. “I don’t wanna talk about it.”

Hunkering down, Tamia grabbed the chin of the man she had just half decapitated and lifted his dead gaze. As she did, the guy's tongue flopped from the vent in his neck. She put a thumb on his chin and moved his mouth like a puppet.  “Hey Hijoki,” Tamia said in a rough mix of Bobcat Goldthwait and an actual bobcat. “I see you’re awful down in the dumps, why don’t you tell me what’s wrong?”

“Damn you Tamia, you know I can’t resist gore based comedy.” Hijoki turned towards her. “Gods, he looks like a pez dispenser.”

It had been sixteen months since they had joined and eight of those had been damn hard work. Hijoki had thought that Tamia would have grown tired of him by now, would have discarded him at the first charity clothes drive she could, and left him to become a third rate handkerchief or worse, a wank sock. But Tamia Santo was a good kid, with boundless energy and drive, and endless optimism. But that was the entire damned problem. Hijoki had lost his entire clan to the Blue Ravens and their overlord, the Technomancer. He was angry every second of every day, and his chief companion in the universe was essentially a puppy who woke up each day as if she’d found the biggest, juiciest cartoon bone.

“I’m just trying to cheer you up, pal.” Tamia dropped the dead dude’s head as if it were just a discarded candy wrapper and stood. “We’ll find them, all of them. If you transferred your consciousness into this sock, then there's a good chance some of the others transferred theirs too.”

Hijoki smiled - well, his seam turned up at the ends, because socks can’t really smile -  but when he spoke, none of the happiness carried over to his voice. “We’ll see, kiddo. I know I can’t take this for much longer.”

“You’re telling me.” Tamia smirked. “These fingers haven’t seen sunlight in a year and a half. My hand probably looks as shrivelled as an octogenarian’s cock by now.”

A cough came from inside one of the slabs on the side of the mortuary wall and Hijoki lunged towards it, pulling Tamia quickly to her feet. They yanked the steel draw open to find a dead young woman, already blue tinged by the blood drain. Another cough, and the two realised it came from a small stuffed grellworm keyring she held in her limp left hand. The worm had been badly damaged, its stuffing poking from its gut.

“Clea?” Hijoki whispered.

The worm opened its eyes and smiled fondly as Tamia picked her up in a delicate grip. “Hijoki? I hoped you’d come.”

Hijoki lowered to the small toy. “What happened, Clea?”

The small toy coughed and small pieces of fluff floated out of her. She didn’t have long left. “They overrode the security systems and…sucked the oxygen out…we…had to soul transfer into the closest thing to hand…” Her head tilted to one side, her eyes closing.

“Clea!” Hijoki shouted to her, her eyes opening once more. “Who did this? Do you know what happened to Tarrell?”

Clea opened her eyes wide and gestured towards a poster on the mortuary's far wall. Apparently the Blue Raven’s annual end of tax year masquerade party was in two days time, with ‘live music from Amorphous Blob Dylan, and a potluck dinner - no Denebrian blood leech tacos this time please.’

“But, Clea, what happened to Tarrell?” Hijoki said as he turned back to find Tamia laying the worm toy back down next to her former body.

“I’m sorry, Hijoki. She’s gone.” She closed the metal drawer respectfully and turned to the sock on her hand. “Who’s Tarrell?”

Hijoki turned slowly towards the poster again. They would pay, all of them. Yes, the Blue Ravens would soon be having a pot unluck dinner. “She was my daughter.”

***

The building was heavily fortified, with two burly looking Security droids at the front entrance, deep in conversation. “I’m telling you Tony-Bot, I think I’m going human. Last nights I thought I dreamed…”

“Let me guess Gino-Bot, was it an electric sheep?” Tony-Bot said, not really interested as he performed a level 2 diagnostic.

“Don’t reinforce dem stereotypes,it makes me open the agita files. I mean yeah, it was, but how do you explain this bodyhair?” He turned, displaying a patch of flesh and burnt hair on his rear side.

“That’s not bodyhair, you gabagoolbot, that’s the scalp of that carbon-baser you disintegrated last Tuesday. It’s stuck to your back unit.” Tony-Bot gave him a dismissive wave.

Gino-Bot lifted a claw to give a robo version of the italian hand. “Youse is a back unit!”

“Excuse me.” A masked young woman cleared her throat and stood waiting in front of them, her hand buried in her clutch bag, rummaging for something. She was dressed in a figure hugging gown with a split at the thigh, and if Tony-Bot was a human, his eye servos might have popped out on stalks and rotated. Instead he was a robot, and his eyes popped out and rotated for servicing purposes.

“Youse gots an invitation?” Tony-Bot asked.

The woman still rummaged in her bag. “I’m sorry, this bag is impractical.”

“Deep_sigh.wav.” Gino-Bot said.

The woman let the clutch drop to the floor, to reveal a sock holding the hilt of a laser sword. Before either of the robots could ask what she was doing, the tube ignited at one end into a laser katana and cut Gino-Bot’s head clean off his frame.

“Don’t cease my functions, I have a partnered unit and four subroutines.” Tony-Bot pleaded on his knees, small drops of lubricant running down his face plate.

“Weh luhs huh yuh uhluhd tuh tuh clud.” Hijoki mumbled, the sword hilt buried in his mouth.

The Droid looked confused, and tilted his head to one side. “What was that?

Lifting the sword high above her head, the young woman smiled. “He said, ‘Well, let’s hope you updated to the cloud’, you punkass bitch-bot.”

***

As the robot's head rolled to a stop by Tamia’s feet, she brought Hijoki up to her face and gave him a hard stare. “Last chance buddy, we can always back out?”

Hijoki almost balled himself up, he was so angry. “Just because I’m tied to your wrist, don’t assume you know me, Tamia.”

Santo stopped dead in her tracks. “Of course I know you, you jackass! I know you like being in the dryer, you like it when I use the lint roller on y…”

“No, we’re not family, not friends.” He spat back, his fury threatening to pull him apart. “We were thrown together through murder and happenstance. This mission is mine. They slaughtered my people, my whole family.”

She sneered, his words obviously hurting her. “They killed my parents, tried to kill me.”

“And I’m sorry for that.” He should feel bad, but the thought of Tarrell’s killers paying for their crimes was all too consuming. “But three lives are nothing compared to genocide.”

She stood, wiping the oil from the blade and not making eye contact with her sock puppet. He suspected she might be crying. “Hijoki…I’m going to pretend you didn’t just gloss over my family being murdered and remember you’re angry and have a history of singular focus.”

“Don’t patronise me.” He had come too far now, and hoped this anger would fuel her rage.  “After this I’m done. We’re done. Nothing matters but this.”

“Fine. Whatever you say.” She said, coldly. “Let’s do this.”

***

Inside, the sound system blared electropunk metal and everyone wore leather. It was as if they’d just discovered The Matrix for the first time, but not seen Matrix Reloaded quite yet to take the shine off the goth apple. Seriously there were like one hundred people here, and about two hundred dead cows, it was obscenely dated. Like they say all trends come around again, but even then, this was still bad taste. Every attendee wore a mask, each one beautiful and elegant. Some had feathers, some scales.

“They’re using my clan’s ceremonial masks!” Hijoki cried, before being quieted by Tamia’s free hand.

“Be quiet, they’ll hear you.” In her Kabuki mask and gown, Tamia looked like she could fit in, but stole the red leather jacket off someone’s chairback to be sure.  She blended amongst the crowd effortlessly, finding herself at the periphery of many conversations she absorbed before moving on. One set of partygoers discussed a recent raid, one increasing the reach of their ‘salvage operations’, one group laughed callously at the dead, describing them as hasbeens of a bygone era. At her waist, she felt Hijoki tighten around her wrist with each laugh and each glass clinked. Gravitating towards the bar, Tamia found an empty spot and leant against it, chin tucked to her chest. She ordered a martini, because she felt like a super spy, then changed her order quick to high alcohol content Tessium Vodka, because she was in need of some dutch courage. “You want a drink?” she muttered to Hijoki, not really interested if he wanted one or not.

“Yeah.” He whispered. “But there’s a puddle of spilt alcohol on the bar over there, just dip me in it and let the fibres soak it up.”

Tamia obliged, and when the guy came back with her drink and a raised eyebrow at her, she looked him dead in the eye and said, “Well, maybe just wipe the bar down, dude. This is a classy place.”

“Aw shit. That hit the spot.” Hijoki said after sucking up all the bar liquid. “If you see a bowl of peanuts, just put me in there, next.”

“Glad I could help this last time.” Tamia sulked, her eyes on the crowd. At the front of the room a stage had been set up for speeches or awards, or one of the hundreds of things that rich people need an elevated platform for to make themselves feel superior. It was probably a lynching, or some sort of pyramid scheme presentation.

“I just wanted to say…” Hijoki started, his words slightly slurred.

She raised her other hand and interrupted him. “Don’t. We do this, then we can pretend this past year and a half never happened.”

Hijoki looked visibly repentant…you know…for a sock. He coughed. “I…”

The lights went out, interrupting their awkward exchange, and a drumroll sounded. Spotlights pointed to the stage where suddenly Admiral Ivy, the head of the Blue Ravens, now stood. Her mask was grand, one half polished to a mirror shine, the other a matt blue painted eye.

“It can’t be…” Hijoki emerged from a bowl of peanuts, his mouth open with half-crushed nuts tumbling from his folds.

“Fellows.” The Admiral began, a wide, almost insane smile on her face. “We did it. The last nomadic transport of the Clan of the Photonic Blade is now gone, and with it, all traces of their past oppressions. It’s been hard work and that’s down to you. To you, Frennic…”

A man in the crowd raised a glass and yelled like a fratboy. “Yoooo! Blue Ravens five-eva!”

“And to you, Gressa.”

A larger woman stood on a chair, clearly inebriated. “ Photonic Blades suuuuuck!” She fell off the chair and slammed into the floor with a sickening thud. She stood up immediately and raised her arms, one of them clearly broken - it dangled at odd angles, the bone sticking out in three places and making her appendage look like a roadkill porcupine. But none of the attendees - nor the woman in question - seemed phased by it. They laughed and cheered like animals, or spectators at your average sports event. Unless it’s cricket, because that’s still a somewhat civilised game.

“And to you, Tamia Santo, who brought our last prey straight to us.” She turned to pick them out at the bar, the spotlights following them. Tamia choked on her drink as every single pair of eyes in the room turned to them slowly, deliberately. Gressa waved her shattered arm at them, flopping side to side with a slick plopping noise, spraying blood over the people to either side of her. They didn’t notice, all continued smiling their insane smiles.

“You look surprised, but that’s why we held this party for you. We opened the door and you just rushed in, Hijoki. It’s what you always do. So single minded, never thinking of the consequences to anyone around you.”

“Hijoki drools, Blue Ravens Rulez.” One partygoer shouted, prompting hooted and hollered responses.

Admiral Ivy nodded. “Thank you, Dreenix! We do indeed rulez. Brothers and sisters, we have come together for the party, please, enjoy the entertainment.” She gestured to Tamia, who felt an icy hand grip her stomach. She looked down to see Hjoki huddled there.

“I’m sorry, I was cold.” He said as he looked up at her.

Of the hundred attendees, ten surrounding them ignited energy swords very much like Tamia’s. “Hijoki…” She whispered, but he wrapped his mouth around the hilt of the blade and lifted it to her other hand. When it touched her fingers he ignited it. She took her last mouthful of the spirit left in her glass, then jumped at the nearest attacker.

The man barely got the sword up in time, and as he blocked her advance, sparks flew from their crossed katana. He pushed back against the blade, the energy glowing hotter, then smiled that sick smile at her, trying to unnerve her. Tamia returned the favour by winking, then spitting the spirits towards his face. As they passed the hot plasma, the spirits ignited and coated his face, burning the mask in an instant. In the brief seconds before he succumbed to the flames, his expression changed, eyes widening and smile vanishing. He became surprised, as if suddenly waking from a dream. Then he fell to the floor and lay still.

The next three attacked at once - because this was real life and not an Assassin’s Creed game - and Tamia raised the sword high in defence. The three raised their own swords in reflection and in anticipated response. Tamia instantly dropped the sword to her lower hand where Hijoki caught it and slashed decisively, taking all three of them at the knees. The three footless attackers then skidded along the floor as she sidestepped, sliding all the way across the polished ballroom and out the main door. “You biiiiiiiiiiiiitch!” one of them yelled as they headed out into the lobby.

Six left now. Six attackers who now looked at each other doubting they could beat their two prey. Tamia smiled from beneath her fox mask - she was good at this. As a scavenger she had been good at pulling things apart, but now she was a surgeon with this sword. The lessons she had learned from Hijoki…no…no time to think of that now, she couldn’t devote thought to the sadness of their parting, she had motherfuckers to kill.

She walked backwards and let them come to her, funnelling them between the tables and keeping them manageable, until her foot hit solid metal. The pot luck dinner table. She reached behind her and grabbed a large metal tourine of casserole that looked like it had some sort of sausage in it, then threw the scalding liquid at the next two attackers. The first took the brunt and collapsed instantly into a burning mess of screaming.

“Awwww, my casserole!” Wailed someone from the crowd, knowing they would never get the praise they deserved.

The second grabbed at his face and she took the opportunity to slice him down the middle, then grabbed a sausage and put it between the sides to make a hot dog out of him. Then she laughed, and from the look on the remaining four attackers’ faces, they must have seen their short, miserable pissant lives at the hands of a giggling psychopath flash before their eyes.

Tamia held out the katana for all to see, it’s cracking red energy lighting her from beneath and making her look terrifying. “The four of you, everyone watching. You have a choice; let us face Admiral Ivy, or we’ll carve you up like a Gargsgiving Finklebird.” (which, to explain, is much like an Earth turkey.)

The four attackers turned their swords off as the crowd ran in fear and she obliged by doing the same. They made a small corridor for Tamia, and as she walked by, casserole pot and sword still in hand, she quickly lifted the pot and put it on the nearest attacker’s head.

“Psych!” She said, then hit the hilt of her blade against the pot to make it ring loudly. While pothead (and not in the good way) was disorientated, Tamia ignited the blade to the most intense setting and sliced through the two swordswomen at her other side before they could lower their swords. The blade was so hot that the two women’s dangling intestines fused together as they hit and they flew through the air like a pair of nunchucks before splatting against the wall and sliding down.

The remaining man was in shock, staring at this blood-covered, gown wearing, maniac and wondering why he had laced his shoes today. Tamia quickly sliced through the neck of Pothead and followed it up with a roundhouse kick that guided the head in a pot directly to the last of her assailants. Catching it and dropping his sword reflexively, he cursed under his breath at his stupidity, just to see Tamia rushing at him with her blade.

“Don’t turn your nose up, I made that meal especially for you!” Tamia laughed as she cut the last one directly through his protesting mouth, cutting the mask he wore in half.

As he dropped to the floor, her eyes flitted to the stage, where Ivy still stood waiting. The last of the Blue Raven bystanders were filing out of the room, and Tami approached the platform, covered in the blood of her subordinates. Tamia went to raise her sword, but was stopped by Hijoki, who held it at her waist and deactivated it.

He rose to face Ivy, but spoke to Tamia as he said, “Give me a second, Tamia.”

“You figured it out then?” The woman said.

“The mask was a giveaway, and a dagger in my heart. Your mother and I gave that mask to you on your day of crossing, when you became an adult.” Hijoki sounded like he was about to weep. “Why? Why would you even do this, Tarrell?

Tamia swallowed, unsure what to do. How could this be Hijoki’s daughter? She resettled her grip on the sword, ready for things to turn south quickly.

“You dare ask me that? Our young people wanted to settle, to stop floating through space looking for a spiritual homeland that might never come.” Tears streamed down her face as she shouted. “We were dismissed by you elders, fought down on a convoy of ships ruled by an immortal race. How long did you fathom we would suffer that?”

“It was not our way.” Hijoki said, the pain in his voice all too real.

“It was not your way!” Tarrell yelled. “So I took matters into my own hands. I transferred my soul into my ceremonial mask, then mailed it to this woman, knowing she couldn’t resist appropriating someone else’ culture. I’ve been controlling the Blue Ravens for a long time, old man. Just because you haven’t yet taken control of your vessel, doesn’t mean I would be so merciful with mine.”

Tamia stood appalled. At any time, could she have been controlled by Hijoki? Hijoki must have known what she was thinking, because he spat back in anger. “I would never take a human's body without consent. That stands in conflict with everything we are!”

“Were.” Tallera corrected. “Now half the clan - my friends and peers - sit under my control. The other half - the dinosaurs that they were - have rightly become extinct. The Technomancer showed me I could be my own person, free from the shackles you had moulded for us.”

“I’m sorry you feel that way, my daughter. I’m sorry that you felt that you had to murder our elders to get your voice heard. That is my failing as a leader, as your father. I admit I was  stern, but I had a clan to care for too.”

“And now you have nothing.” Tarrell smirked in true loathing, lifting her own katana.

“I am heartbroken, Tarrell. But I will not fight you. You and and the remaining members of the clan can do whatever you want, just let us be on our way. Let’s go, Tamia.” Tamia again went to ignite the blade, but Hijoki told her ‘no’ and wrestled the blade from her grip.

Tamia turned and began walking down the stage, only for her to feel the heat rising from Tarrell. “You don’t get to turn your back on me again, Father! You don’t understand that while you live, there can be no peace for me!”

Tarrell charged, and Tamia braced, knowing that without the sword in hand she would be cut in two. She heard the katana ignite, felt the heat of it on her skin, then nothing. It was only after a second that she realised the heat was coming from the blade Hijoki held, their sword. As Tamia turned, Tarrell stood impaled, her eyes wide in fury, her dress growing a dark patch in the middle. Hijoki let the sword fall with his daughter’s body.

“I said I would not fight you, Tarrell. I did not say the Technomancer would take another daughter from me.” Hijoki whispered, watching as life slipped from Tarrell’s eyes.

Tamia reached towards the sword and deactivated the blade sticking from Tarrell’s corpse. After Hijoki reached to close her eyes (I remind you this pathos is occurring with a sock puppet), Tamia cleared her throat, wondering what to say. He had killed his flesh and blood for her. “I’m sorry, Hijoki”

“Don’t be, Tamia. I lost her long ago, it seems. I lost a great many of them.”

A silence hung between them, one that Tamia was keen to break. “What do we do now?”

Hijoki could not break his gaze from the body on the stage. “Whatever it is, we decide together. I am not fit to lead, that is clear to me.”

Tamia stood, brushed her gown off and looked at the bloody mess surrounding them.  “Well I can’t return this dress, and if you think I’m cleaning this mess up for honours sake you’ve got another fucking thing coming. One vote for killing that Technomancer piece of shit?”

Hijoki took his eyes off his daughter and stared at the blade in Tami’s hand. “Seconded.” He sneered.

THE END
