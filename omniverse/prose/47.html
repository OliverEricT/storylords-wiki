S2 Episode 21 - Dr Wrath-Love (Or how I learned to stop worrying about prompts and love the shoe-horn)


Prompts: Signposts and Underworlds


By Rich Masters


NOW 


Kellan found herself in a chair in a dark room, where she could just make out a large, semicircular table of stone in front of her. She moved her hands and feet, expecting them to be bound (or hoping, am I right S&M lovers?), but they were free. Instantly her hands moved to her face, the helm she had been wearing in the tournament was gone, her identity revealed to all in this…underground waiting room? In the distance she could just make out a panpipe version of The Girl From Ipanema, and at a side table next to her were a number of out of date magazines covered in a thick layer of dust - Cosmos-politan, Relativity Fair and the like. She stood, and looked around the room, but couldn’t pierce the veil of darkness that extended a few metres in front of her. Surrounded by a circle of light, she looked up to find a solitary spotlight peering down on her. She took a step, and the light followed. She took another, it followed again. She then took a sidestep and then quickly back again and the operator lost her temporarily before locating her pointing her middle finger at the light operator. She sat back down and languidly drew a ‘Cool S’ in the dust at the table.


“Please don’t do that” A voice came across the stone table. “That rune is the most dangerous rune ever committed to school exercise books and trapper keepers in the known Omniverse. Except the one that summons a giant barbarian feline with a spiky tail when you change a drawing of a penis into a cat of course.”


Kellan sat, and small spotlights illuminated the people around the table, all wearing animal helms. “Who are you, girl? Why have we never registered you before?” The old, decrepit voice of the Will asked as Kellan sat in the chair in front of the full panel of the Pillars of Ilima.  The only one missing was Wrath, and that made her realise something. The tournament she had just been in was a Pillarström, a meet to pick a new successor. This was how she was to become Wrath. The temporal mechanics in play were giving her a headache.


They sat, angry helmets staring at her, waiting for a response. When none came, The Writ leaned forward. “Speak, Riftwalker! Few can do what you can, even amongst this council. I myself can only draw on the arcane forces when no one is looking directly at me, and only then after I’ve had one drink so nerves don’t get the better of me.”


“Are we talking Rifts or…?” Kellan waved her little finger, drooping it slightly.


“Enough jokes.” The Word stepped down from the table, looking furious even through that static helmet, like at the end of Empire Strikes Back when Darth Vader loses Luke and he looks sad, even though he hasn’t changed his expression. Anyone? Anyone? The Word was clearly struggling to control fury, and put a hand on the chair as she came to stand with Kellan. “ The Wraith and I will interrogate the girl, and find out what she knows.”


Kellan tried to focus, to open a Rift so she could leave this place and find Oryx and HUM-13, but her body refused to comply. It was as if the ability had been turned off.


“We’re prepared for your tricks Kellan.” The Wraith said. “No one can Rift inside Mt Barbaras.”


So she was deep inside the home of the Pillars, inside the mountain overlooking the capital. How long had she been asleep? The two Pillars dragged her, kicking and fighting, into a adjacent room, where they threw her towards a chair and locked the door after them.


“You’ve got a hell of a lot to answer for, Kellan.” The Word took her helm off, to reveal a face Kellan knew all too well.

24 hours ago…


The sun was dipping faster than your mother’s head in the bathroom stall at that bar she frequents to catch the eye of young college dropouts, and the sun was nearly as low as the self esteem any man would have to possess to take on the horrible burden of her desperation. 


The crowd roared in anticipation of the fight, and Kellan looked out over the crowd to see armies of people wearing the image of the robocentaur she was currently fighting on their shirts.


“Stomp the bitch to paste!” One shouted.


“Grind that slut into the ground!” Another bellowed.


“Have a good clean fight and don’t let us down by being misogynistic or a bad influence on young sports fanciers. Let’s remember it’s just a game!” An android yelled, only to be turned on by the pack around him and torn to pieces for being ‘a gay’ and not your typical braindead, meathead sportsfan.


The giant beast splicer charged at her, spear in hand, his robo horse mouth slathering as he did, turning just in time, she dodged, but got caught by him and tumbled to the ground. He spun and raised his arms, prompting a huge cheer from the crowd.  Kellan got up to all fours and lifted her her helm to wipe her mouth. She drew her hand back and a thin line of blood trailed across her hand in that cool way that protagonists do. She thought of her future self’s weathered face and wondered if the split along her mouth would leave that familiar scar.


“Alright No-Taro, time to finish this.” Kellan said. 


The crowd fell silent, and her rival tilted his head and snorted.


Kellan stood, shrugging. “I realise now, you probably don’t know that reference, it’s from Mortal Kombat 3, arguably the best in the series unless you count MK Trilogy, which was really only the updated MK3. Not a fighting game fan, huh? Surprising. It’s like you modelled your whole look on him. Or like maybe your stable master was a big fan of Mr Ed and Robocop or something. Wait, were you a Velitean man who wanted to be more horse, or a Velitean horse who wanted to be more like a man. If it’s the latter, I don’t know whether fighting you is some sort of act of cruelty. Maybe you’d just like a carrot and a brush instead?”


The Centaur roared and charged again, but this time Kellan stood her ground, not even raising Doomcock. She just stared the approaching splicer down and with a waft of her hand, opened a Rift in front of him, then opened its partner in front of a blacksmith's anvil just outside the fighting ring. His head rung against the metal with a resounding clang. She then opened a Rift as he fell backwards, and opened another into a janitor’s tent, where the sound of multiple rakes being stepped on and hitting the centaur in the face could be heard. As No-tarro stepped out of the janitor tent, dazed, she opened a rift in front of him that he fell into, then was there to meet the opening with a well placed fist.


The crowd fell silent again, contemplating the victorious Kellan, who looked up to the royal box, where her mother and father were straight up staring at her in shock. Then everyone erupted into cheers and screams, the centaur bros ripping their shirts off instantly and reassembling the Android they had torn apart so he could cheer with them too. “Yay!” He said.


“I don’t mean to be presumptuous, but I have already started 3D printing merchandise for the new Wrath.” A robotic but clearly human voice sounded behind her. As she turned, HUM-13 pulled a T-Shirt over her that showed a cartoon of Kellan holding a warhammer with the words, ‘Psycho-Wrath’ printed underneath. Oryx stood next to HUM-13, staring at Kellan as if she was a stranger.


“Kellan?” He asked, not quite sure it was his friend.


“It’s me, Oryx.” She whispered, shocked that she looked so different. “How long has it been since you last saw me?”


“A year, FriendKellan.” HUM-13 declared. “And you?”


Kellan was shaken, how was that possible? How had she been away for over a decade whilst they…she smiled, of course. Even if she had spent ten years away, she could have arrived back at any point on their journey. “Nearly eleven years. How did you come back in time?”


HUM-13 and Oryx, looked at each other, shocked by the news that she had been away so long and at her question. ‘Humie and I have been traversing time through the Rifts ever since we all touched Doomcock and were diverged.” Oyrx said. “We anticipated you were attempting to get us all back together somehow.”


Kellan looked around. “No, it wasn’t me…wait, I haven’t heard any sexual innuendo for two minutes…where’s Ash and Hallgrim?”


“We assumed they were with you, or having the similar sort of fun temporal shenanigans we were.” HUM-13 said. “I am so pleased to see you, FriendKellan.”


The three of them embraced, and she felt a relief wash over her that her friends were alive.


“Your joy…is short lived…human.” No-tarro said in gasping wheezes, as he raised his spear. 


“Sounding a little horse there friend.” HUM-13 said then laughed robotically.


“The Reap will never submit.” No-tarro said as he threw the spear. Kellan dodged the incoming weapon from her Centaur opponent, before realising the shaft wasn’t meant for her. It flew towards the royal box, towards her mother’s chest. And Kellan knew she couldn’t open a Rift fast enough to get to it.


HUM-13 sent a go-go gadget arm out and caught the spear mid-flight, before he turned to the Reap, realising it was a distraction all too late. 


“Long live the Reap.” He pressed a button on a small metallic box he held, and explosions rocked the crowd around them.

24 hours ago, at another time (yeah alright, I know it’s confusing, ok? You try and keep all these threads together!).


A pregnant Asher held her somehow older sister at arm's length, looking over the scarring on her face. “How has it been 12 years? It has been only a few for us.”


Kellan looked as if she had been through the ringer, and Hallgrim patted her on the shoulder. “12 years have been unkind to you mate. You been doing UFC while you been gone, or are you trying to stay incognito? I think I realised why you start wearing the helm.”


Kellan smirked. “Look who’s talking, you look like you’ve been dragged through a hedge backwards. And not a normal hedge, a mutant one that tried to rough fuck you on the way through.” The smile faded. “I haven’t been controlling this, your Rifting I mean. Humie and Oryx and I have been doing the same, jumping through time without purpose or direction…”


“Wait, where’s Florgo?” Asher asked. “Did he just fade into existence like the boring spec he is?”


“Who?” Said Kellan, before realising. “Oh…Florgo…”


She explained about Florgo, about her journeys in the Underworld (look, I’m not writing another underworld story for a prompt, so if you want to understand that reference go to episode… look, I’m not finding that information, so if you want to get that reference to a reference, go to the website…ehhhhh, you mean I have to list this…ok FINE…www.storylords.page), about her raising Asher as a child, she also dropped in a few jokes about listeners’ mothers just for good measure. Man, if you think mine are cutting, hoo boy, you’d have wished you were an orphan. 


“I can’t remember you looking after me as a kid? Was I happy?” Asher asked, and at Kellan’s nod, she burst into tears. Hallgrim comforted her, and Kellan noticed the bump at her belly. She must have been almost due.


“She’s having a baby. I saved her life.” A small girl's voice came from Kellan’s side and she jumped out of her skin.


“Who the fuck are you, weirdly silent creepy girl?” Kellan said.


“That’s Shelly, she’s the former Page of Lord Chunder, some Reap tribe dickhead we just killed. The Reap were our fault, just so you know? We left them to die here, Kels. They are pissed beyond belief. We started all this.” Hallgrim grit his teeth, not really ready to forgive Kellan for sending them here, even though he knew in his heart it wasn’t her fault.


“Lord Chunder?” Kellan put a hand to her mouth, and Asher took a deep breath and felt her stomach.


Hallgrim put his hands in the air. “What? What fucking now? Is he going to come back as a robot? Or a ghost? Please not robohitler again. Is his kid going to swear vengeance and get us when we Rift in ten minutes? Fuck sake, he isn’t my dad is he?”


Asher uttered a long groan, and Hallgrim turned to her as Shelly rushed to her side. “I know, love, it’s a joke. We get rid of one tosspot and he comes back as an alternate timeline version. We’re going to get Chairman Mao, but the dog version, or JK Rowling as Laffy Taffy. It’s too much.”


“Hallgrim, it’s coming.” Asher was helped to the ground by Shelly, and Kellan went to her side too. When Asher noticed a look on Kellan’s face, she grabbed her. “What is it, what aren’t you telling us?”


“If the baby is coming, that means Chunder is coming for her.” Kellan explained. “I found out a few weeks ago, Chunder will murder her and leave you two to rot here.”


Hallgrim remembered what the crone had said to him, when she had repaired him - a diminished lifespan based on his power usage for his memory back. It was worth losing some of that lifespan to protect his unborn daughter. “Alright, fuck it. I’m going to go be a man. Time to be bold, to be decisive, to…” He started walking and then turned back. “What should I do, honey?”


Asher threw him a blade. “Put the pointy end in him, I’m a bit busy at the moment.” She said before groaning in pain.

The Reap attacked in droves, killing the shocked audience members, soldiers of Ilima, and dignitaries alike. It was chaos, but Kellan felt good fighting alongside Oryx and HUM-13 again.

The Amray’s had moved from the Royal Box, and Kellan had to put aside her fears about whether they were alive or not. Her future self had never told her about this event, and considering how time was as fucked as P.Diddy’s next protege, it was clear anything was fair game now.


She looked around at the carnage surrounding her, the life lost. She new that the Reap attacks had precipitated her father’s work with the colonies, in order to help their plight be heard by the Velit and Norn. She wondered if she had enough time, more control, if she could go back and stop this, to help smooth the cracks that had formed. Time stretched out in her mind and she pieced it all together. There must be ays she could prevent some of this happening, surely?


As two Reap assassins broke her concentration and charged her, Kellan opened two Rifts with the same exit point. As they entered the Rifts and then suddenly merged together, the two men screamed in agony. Luckily, the two had been hiding deep affection for each other, and the merging allowed them to confront their feelings. They would be together another fifty years, literally and figuratively inseparable. Don’t say all my love stories end in tragedy.


Oryx was deep in battle with No-tarro, and jumped on his back, riding him like a bucking bronco. As the centaur wore himself out, Oryx death rolled him, spinning him round and round on the floor, snapping bones as he did. As the Centaur was subdued, his limbs a mess of angles, Oryx was filled with the sudden urge to paint him, a perfect analogy for how his splicer brethren had been sent off on missions and casually disposed of.


Deeper in the confusion, HUM-13 ran from a gang of Reap who were intent on killing him. He quickly turned his legs to tank treads and zoomed off, the marauders in hot pursuit. As he turned down an alleyway, he encountered a refuse vehicle blocking his path, with no way to escape the incoming throng. 


“Get the metal bastard, Jemma!” One of the Reap who was part boar, part ugly guy said to his leader, a hybridised bear woman. 


“When we get him, we disassemble him and sell the parts to fund the war effort.” Jemma said as they rushed down the alleyway, before stopping at a metal signpost that read ‘This way for robot’ which pointed to black hole in the back of a vehicle. The gang clambered in, and when the last person was contained, HUM-13 turned back into his normal, human self and shut the lid, then pressed a button to send the bin straight to the refuse sorting plant. Hopefully where they could be sorted into dickhead and slightly less of a dickhead.


He returned to the centre ring, where it looked like Kellan, Oryx and the remainder of the Iliman military were detaining the rest of the Reap. As one was carted away, she yelled, “We only want to live”. HUM-13 turned to find Oryx staring at him, and Kellan was looking down at the floor. Was this who they had become - time displaced meddlers propping up a broken institution, hurting the people who were just fighting for the right to exist?


Through the dust cloud that had been kicked up by the conflict came the marching of boots, and clattering of weapons. It was the Pillars of Ilima.


“Finally.” Kellan said, approaching the Way. “If we hurry, we can…”


The punch across the jaw came quickly, and Kellan saw black before her head hit the ground.

Hallgrim marched into the shiftsands, after the gruelling climb down the mountain, to find a batch of lizardmen gathering around. They stood on their hindlegs, and Hallgrim recognised one of them as the sentient lizard Lord Chunder had used as his steed and called Esmerelda. As he approached, the lizards voices became clearer.


“And then I said to her, ‘damn baby’ you gonna make my cloaca twitch, or make me splooge over a clutch o’ your eggs, whichever way we procreate in this universe which the author obviously doesn’t wanna get into right now.” One said.


Another slapped his friend on the back and laughed. “Shit Lizard, what your hatchling momma say about that?” 


“She said…” He stopped, his tongue flicking the air. “Wait man, you taste that on the air?”


A few of the others flicked out their tongues. “Yeah, tastes like metal and flesh and radiation.”


Esmerelda turned, his maw covered in blood, viscera dripping from his teeth. “Smells like man.”


“Woah, woah, woah, meat is definitely not back on the menu, boys.” Hallgrim approached with his hands held up. “Remember me? I was the one that slit Chunder’s throat and threw him off a cliff? I come in peace…actually I cum in a pretty sweet piece right now, that’s kind of why I’m here. I need to save my girlfriend, I need you to help me find Chunder.”


The lizard’s laughed as one, a throaty bark that echoed against the rocky valley walls. “Human in a can is an idiot. What do you need him for anyway, human, you hungry?” One of the lizards gestured to a pile of meat and bones that was once Chunder, his corpse a bloody mess that was most definitely not threatening.


“Well, not the least effective villain we’ve ever faced.” Hallgrim muttered.


***


“You’ll get through this Ash, you will.” Kellan squeezed her sister’s hand. “Just breathe.”


“Don’t fucking tell me to breathe, I’ve been doing that as long as I’ve been alive! Show me magic trick how to stretch lady parts to opening size of bowling ball! That will be helpful.” Asher shouted through gritted teeth.


Shelly stood, holding some boiling water and towels. “I’ve got to be honest, I am being written by a man, so I’m unsure what these things are for,  Cleanliness? Sterilisation?Everything Ive seen about childbirth makes me think it best to have them. ”


“Just hold her hand and let her know she’ll be ok, Shelly.” Kellan said. “You’ve got one or two pushes left, Ash. Just gotta push as hard as you can.”


Rich Masters sat at his laptop, pondering if he could juggle the humorous elements of the podcast with the sincerity and seriousness of childbirth without being a dick or inadvertently offensive to women. He looked out his window for a good ten minutes, wondering what the play was here, the tightrope stretching out in front of him that threatened to turn into a snare. Then a baby cried. “Thank fuck for that.” Sighed Rich.


“She’s beautiful.” Shelly whispered as Kellan wrapped the baby in a towel, then passed her to Ash. 


Asher had never seen anything so beautiful, and she had once watched Hallgrim sneeze so hard he kneed himself in the face. Oh man, that was funny. But this girl, she put that moment to pasture. Her ten little fingers and ten little toes were so perfect, so symmetrical. She had never felt so happy, but also scared, and exhausted. Her eyes were heavy and she passed the baby to Kellan. “Go to your aunt, she’ll love you almost as much as I do.”


As Kellan took the baby, Asher fell straight to sleep, weary as she was. With a gesture of her head to Shelly, Kellan stood and walked away from the resting Asher. Shelly followed, and had walked about ten paces when she  looked down, noticing she was still holding the water. “What a stupid idiot, I brought the wat…” She started, before she dropped the bowl to the ground, spilling water over the dry sands.


The knife was quick, and Shelly’s hands went to her throat, but she couldn’t stop the blood from pouring out and within seconds she had collapsed on the floor, unable to speak, but staring with such intense contempt out of wide, globe like eyes. Kellan turned away.


A purple portal opened in front of them.


“Come on, little Kellan.” She whispered to the baby as she walked through. “Time for you to earn your birthright.” 


***


NOW AGAIN (shut up you know what I mean)


“Ash?” Kellan whispered, the sight of her sister’s face a balm for her soul. She got up and opened her arms to embrace her sister.


Ash backhanded Kellan across the room with more force than any of the Reap could have mustered, and she landed in a heap in the corner of the room.


“Where is my baby, Kellan?” Ashe hissed through gritted teeth.


Wraith removed his warhelm to reveal himself as Hallgrim, but all the joy she would have felt at that revelation was instantly consumed in the look he gave her. “Why did you take her? And why did you kill Shelly? She was only a kid, Kels. Tell me this is some sort of mistake. Tell me there’s a reason.” 


“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Kellan said, her gaze flicking between the pair who looked back with such hatred. “I haven’t seen you since the day we were split, that was a decade ago.”


“Lies!” Asher yelled, drawing back a fist, but Hallgrim was quick to catch it.


“Look at her Ash, really look. She’s younger than the Kellan we saw, much younger looking. She hasn’t got the scars.” Hallgrim gestured to Kellan.


“So who took our baby?” Asher wept. “And what do they want her for?”


***


Wrath stepped through the portal, baby in arm, into the Amray residence where she once served as attendant to her adoptive mother and father. The two Greywoods, now in their original forms of Dr James Kendall and Dr Big Sue Campbell, looked up at the advancing Wrath from their position at the desk, eyeing the bundle in her arms with glee.


“You got her!” Big Sue smiled. “Well done, Wrath.”


Wrath put the baby down on the desk and backed away. “It was easy. Like plucking a stone from a river. Now do what you promised and unlock her full potential. I want you to make it so she isn’t so wayward with her Rifts like I am, like young Kellan is.”


Sue waved a dismissive hand. “Of course. We can pump her so full of chronal energy she could remake the timelines in our image. We’ll all of us have all that we want, all we ever could desire.”


James had pulled up a holographic display of the child’s brain and saved some data to a drive that was plugged into it, because USB’s are still a thing for the purpose of this story.. “It’s simple really, we’ve been working on it for four hundred years. All we need to do is detailed in this drive. …” 


A sound like a tomato popping was heard, and Big Sue turned to find what was left of  James Kendall’s destroyed head on the end of Doomcock. As she faced Wrath, the Pillar pulled her rifle Callus from her back and shot Sue clean through the stomach. The woman fell to the floor, killed instantly.


Wrath unplugged the drive and stashed it in a bag, along with her helm. She picked up the baby and walked out of the residence and into the city, amongst the thousands of people there. An old woman stopped her to coo over the baby, then looked up at Wrath.


“She’s got your eyes, my dear.” She beamed.


“Lady, you have no idea.” Wrath said, and vanished into the crowd.



THE END
