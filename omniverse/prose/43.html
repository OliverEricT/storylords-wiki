S2 Episode 16 - What’s Love Grorp To Do With It?


Prompts: Staffs and Baking


By Rich Masters



On Mount Barbaros, the remaining 4 Pillars of Ilima sat in a wide circle, or a square I guess. Missing of course was the Wraith, the chief assassin on duty in the far rim, and the Word, who had been missing since before the war had started.


The new Wrath, their old attendant Grorp, was also absent. He hadn’t attended a session of the Pillars since being made their leader by the Greywoods, and they hadn’t seen him in person since the Greywoods had killed the Watch for his failure with General Clamphands, letting Kellan Amray escape. There were only four of them left now.


Who says that this story is too complicated…Who? WHO DARES?!


“If we don’t convince him this plan is foolish, he’s going to get us all killed.” Said the Will, their religious leader. She stabbed at the fires in the centre of the room. “I know we haven’t always seen eye to eye, but we agree on why we’re here. To defend the system and defend her people. Chasing a teenager at the expense of the realm is the worst idea since people putting patreon cash before friendship and fucking up a perfectly good deal…thank god, that other, better show replaced it…what was it called, Story…”


“Lords have mercy!” Said the Writ, standing. “One of us needs to find him and tell him how stupid this is. He lived here for years, he is one of us. He’ll understand, he’s sensible. Where is he?”


The Way gestured behind them. “He’s in the galley, baking apology muffins to the Greywoods for not catching Kellan yet.”


The Ward laughed sickly. “He’s insane.”


“God’s. I’ll go talk to him.” The Writ said, standing. He marched through the curtain and to the back of the living quarters, and onto the galley. The muffins were made, but Wrath was nowhere to be seen, and Writ called to him.


In the silence that echoed back at him, he heard the creepy whispers that would make your normal layperson run. We’ve all seen horror movies, we’re not stupid. Sadly, The Writ had not seen any, and ventured towards the back of the galley in the direction of the creepy whispering. As he rounded the counter, Group sat on the floor, looking at his own reflection in the bottom of a pan and holding a rolling pin.


“Grorp…I…am…Grorp.” He whispered, and looked at Writ. “I remember…I remember.”


Writ ran to his fellow Pillar, in shock at his lack of rhyming, putting a hand to his back. “Grorp, are you ok? Talk to me Grorp.”


But Grorp was lost in memory, and I’m glad because I’m not the least bit invested in writing any more of this scene. Onwards!

Darkness. Evil. Brimstone and Sulphur. A well of despair with no escape. A desperate hole no one should ever find themselves in. No, we’re not talking about your mother’s pants, we find ourselves in a hellish dimension. You would think it would be hot in a hell dimension, because of all your years of westernised, Christianity-informed versions of hell, but in actuality, sometimes hell was more humid and rainy, kind of like an English summer. As she sat beside the lava shores, Kellan posited that she felt like those sweaty dollar bills that your average Walmart skank pulls out of their bras. No one wants your titty money, you gross degenerates. I mean, thank god this isn’t in the middle ages and you were paying with a tally stick, because I don’t want to imagine where you’d be pulling that gross, tide-marked phallus shaped stick from. Jesus, this is my first paragraph, Kellan thought. This chapter is going to be angrier than a boomer when someone suggests seasoning in food.


“What makes you stare so into space,

With such severe resting bitch face?”


Grorp looked up with a too-toothy smile, his small, ethereal demon form floating there next to her like a sentient fart. Was it really possible that this harmless little goblin looking thing was somehow the thing that killed her mother and allowed the Greywoods to assume control of Ilima? I mean, probably, right? Grorp isn’t exactly a common name like Muhammad, or John, or Skanky Old Bitch. What do you mean Skanky Old Bitch isn’t a common name? Then why are so many of your mothers called that?


“We need to move soon, we can’t get caught by any of the roaming groups of demons.” Kellan said, pushing herself off the ground, and rubbing the brimstone off her slacks. “It’s been weeks, we need to find my sister.”


“You spoke too soon, and now they come,

Through the gauntlet we must run.” Grorp whispered.


A gang of male demons stared at them as they wandered down the beach with a purpose. A gang of reds, the worst of the standard demons, and eight strong they were. They were made up of the worst of the worst in hell, the ultimate sinners, the ones from the central spheres alongside the paedophiles and Judas. And as they came face to face, Kellan knew she was going to have a fight on her hands. She raised her warhammer, Doomcock, and pointed it towards the crowd.


***

Ten miles away stood a castle carved out of two dragons who died doing it dragon style, which is…well, whichever sexual position is just a little too much for you, listener, that’s it.  And if you have no limits, then what are you saying? That you’d have sex with your mother? Or an animal? Or the dead? Or you dead, animal, mother? Shame on you! The Castle grew out of the banks of a river of lava that ebbed and flowed with a strong, thick tide of high waves of fire. On the banks, two surfbro demons in cargo shorts stood watching the tide, then grabbed their boards as a large wave of lava came on the horizon. They jumped into the tide, only for the boards to instantly melt and the demons sank into the lava.


“Harsh, Bro…” One said.


“Totally, Dude…” The other responded as he melted.


“Who dares try and show me up? I’M the powerful one here, the leader of this hell dimension. No one has a bigger dick than me, and I have the meanest vagina in the ten spheres!” Beefcurtain shouted as her attendant followed her as she paced, trying to fan her.


“I agree, your thickthighedness. You have a dick that would make famous lothario, Girth Hangdrop, die of jealousy…or the many, many sexually transmitted diseases he eventually died with.” 


“Quiet, Spelgor, you obseqiuous little cancerous polyp!” Beefcurtain snapped. “This girl is performing magic willy nilly…willynillily…willy…with impunity…and is challenging my authority as queen bitch of this dimension, and I want them to suffer! And not just in the pleasant way I like, or the way you suffer when you bring me my tea at anything other than perfect drinking temperature!”


Spelgor looked down at his bandaged burned hands. “You had previously said that you liked it hot to heighten the anticipation of drinki…”


“Speeeelgor, what have I said about contradicting me?” 


“That contradicting you implies the possibility of me being right, which is as statistically impossible as R Kelly passing a kindergarten without breaking into a sweat?”


Beefcurtain’s head tilted. “No…well yes, but I meant the other thing.”


Spelgor shuffled uncomfortably. “That contradicting you is a one way ticket to disembowel town?”


“Indeed.” Beefcurtain sighed. “I don’t know, I just feel so low lately, ruling the worst of the worst just isn’t as rewarding as it used to be. There’s only so many times you can boil someone’s blood in their bodies before it isn’t even sexually gratifiying anymore.”


As they came to the double doors of the great hall located in the dragon castle’s nutsack, Spelgor speeded up to sidle to his master. “You still have me, my Queen.”


Beefcurtain pushed the doors open. “You have a point, Spelgor, there is nowhere to go but up from rock bottom.”


The great hall was large and echoing, and the Queen of Hell took her position on the throne made up of old boyfriends she had petrified and broken into the shape of a seat. She had taken particular joy in that, making the man who never went down on her’s face the seat of her chair.


Her war council stood in a large semi circle around her on the floor, the generals of hell. There were the three Capitalist Fates, Bezoselbub, Muskrat, and The Gateskeeper, hooded in the gold they had stolen and died with like pharaohs of old, but shittier somehow. There was Hitlerbot, the former leader of the Nazis in the robot body he had died in. There was the Technowitch JK Rowling, who was complaining about the lack of single sex toilets in the castle. There was Lord Uruk the transdimensional troll, who ate babies but was somehow embarrassed to be the most decent person in the room. There was that postman who delivers your items like they’ve been dragged through a mangle even though it clearly say fragile on the fucking tape, oh and he was a vampire. And there was a small serpent dog called Malcolm who stayed separate from the rest.


Rowling and the three Fates of Capitalism stepped forward.


“Well, well, well, if it isn’t the Cunt Rushmore of historical villainy.” Beefcurtain said, putting her legs up on the armrest of the throne. “Where’s this magical bitch?”


The Technowitch stepped forward. “I’m here my Quee…”


“Not you, Jo. Just because you wrote some shitty, inconsistent fantasy magicwank books that are as basic as a white girl with a frappacino reaching for the pumpkin spice, doesn’t mean you’re magic. Although if you were at least you could disappear quickly.” With a wave of her hand, Rowling was dismissed in a cloud of orange smoke that enveloped and transported her away. Beefcurtain turned to the three fates of capitalism, the snake bodies they had assumed in hell slithering forward slightly. “Has the money you put on the girl’s head born any fruit?”


The three mansnakes looked at each other, and then began blaming each other for their collective ineptitude.


“I propose we call our collective the ‘X Fates’.” Muskrat said. “Our branding is wrong, and these two won’t change anything.”


Bezoselbub scoffed. “What is your obsession with the letter X, you’re like an incel teenage edgelord. We don’t need to change anything, I like the model the exact way it’s been for the past four millennia.”


“Won’t someone think of the environment?” Gateskeeper whined. “I mean, anyone but someone who clearly has the money to do something about it, obviously?”


“You’re as fucking useless as you were in life, you leeches.” Beefcurtain dismissed them, then turned to the others. “And so, I turn to my old reliables. You are the primo henchmen of hell, the Maestros of misery. Serve me well, find her.”


“Und how exactly do you propose ve do zat?” Hitlerbot demanded. “Uruk, Postie Dracula  und I can kill her, but ve are not bloodhunds.”


“I’ll think of something to tempt her in.” She dismissed the three of them, leaving her with Macolm, who came trotting over to her, his forked tongue tasting the air. “You are used to this Malcolm, you have been there at the end with other heroes of evil. Is this the end for me? Is this the end of all things? How am I going to beat her?”


He opened his mouth and let his tongue loll out. “Well buddy, I seen full bore warlords go down to fairies, alien invaders lose against Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum, and Technodemons go down to a gold gal playing a keytar and her band of dimension hoppers. I seen ‘em come and go like yesterday's Taco Bell. And some extremely violently, like the day before yesterday's leftover Taco Bell. These time travellers? they‘re about as unpredictable as a drunk hookup, you might think you’re going to bed with Girth Hangdrop, but then you wake up with Teensy Peckermouse. Alls I know is, that thing you be keeping down in your dungeon, he’s the key to catchin’ your witch.”


Spelgor cleared his throat. “Ummm, who are you talking to, your skinpeelingness?”


She turned and glared, then swung back to where Malcolm had been, but the damn dog had vanished again. Storming past her assistant, she walked to the bookcase on the far side of the hall and ran her finger over the tomes. Crime and Punishment, Of Human Bondage, Don Quixote, then found the book she was looking for the evilest one of all, Miles to Go, the Autobiography of Miley Cyrus. She shuddered before pulling the book, and the shelf moved with a creak of stone to reveal the secret staircase within. 


“Come on.” Beefcurtain hissed, pressing her arse to the torch to light it with its hotness and holding it in front of her as she almost jogged down the steps. When she came to the bottom, she stood in front of a magical barrier, shimmering in what looked like a green liquid wall.


Beyond it, a man sat, hunched forward, in a filthy hooded robe. The soles of his feet were crusted in filth, and his hands were blackened. He swirled a finger in the air and the small dust motes at his feet danced in the air.


“How long have you been back home, beloved? A year? Five?” Beefcurtain smiled.


“Six years, twenty seven days, and this thrilling conversation.” The man said, still focused on his dust dance. “You haven’t tortured me for a few weeks, my Queen. Too busy basking in your own dickishness? RoboRiech, The Far Writer, and the rest of the Moron Mob’s tongues not sufficiently up your arse today? I would oblige of course, it’s just I’m a little dry and I hate you with every cell in the entirety of my body.”


“Why the constant hostility, betrothed? Surely that should wait until after our marriage contract has dried?” She smiled, then gestured for Spelgor to remove the restraints. The man’s attention lifted. “I know you want to try and kill me as soon as I drop the barrier, my disobedient little doggy. But there is a Riftwalker in my Helscape, one that I will happily destroy unless you help me convince her to leave. Consider it a wedding gift.” She immediately noticed the twist of head when she mentioned the Riftwalker.


The barrier came down, and he was on his feet and at her throat in an instant. Spindly thin fingers wrapped around Beefcurtain’s neck. He squeezed, but she vanished, an illusion. Then she was behind him, a sharp stab in his shoulder, before being lifted off the ground by the giant scorpion tail that floated out from under her leather miniskirt. 


He laughed, a sickness to it. “And what gives you the impression I know anything about some random intruder to our shithole of a dimension?”


As she twisted him to face her, his hood fell down to reveal his face. While admittedly, this would be more impactful in a visual medium, though older, scarred, and emaciated, the face was clearly that of an older Florgo. 


“Must be magic.” She smirked.

The lead demon stood before Kellan and Grorp, suddenly sticking a hand out to her.


“Hey, human! My boys and I haven’t seen you on these shores before. And I’ve got one question for you…” A demon said to Kellan. “What house are you? We’re mostly Slytherin, all except Marcus, he’s totally a Hufflepuff, right Marcus?”


The crowd parted to show Kellan a huge, muscular demon in flood pants and braces. “Yeah, I’m not really very remarkable.” He said, before getting his phone from his pocket and playing shitty compressed music through his shitty phone speakers and expecting everyone in a public place to be ok with it.


It was then that Kellan noticed the T-shirt one of the demons were wearing, it said “Being Gay, Not OK.” on it. Kellan squinted at him and gripped the warhammer tighter.


“It’s Quelbork and Skeeve, not Quelbork and Squeeve.” He said smugly.


Kellan couldn’t hide her confusion. “Wait, i..is Squeeve a male name or something? I’m not familiar with your demon naming conventions.”


The Demon sneered. “Well, that actual name is unisex, but it’s the only one that rhymes. Anyway that’s not the point. We’re straight loving, too-old Harry potter fans that play our music in public, occasionally do improv sessions for people that don’t want to hear it, and have our phone keytones on loud. Also, my boy Limmott here has this new crypto currency he wants to talk to you about.”


Limmott walked up with his ‘Restore the Snyderverse’ hat on. “Basically…” he started.


With a wave of her hand, Kellan Rifted them all so that they were half encased in the rocky ground that say below them. They writhed, trying to free themselves from the demonic mountain they had become.


“Hey, you can’t just leave us here, you Mary Sue! We’re male demons, we have a demon-god given blood right to be her…”


Kellan Rifted the demon’s mouth onto his butt to stop him talking. “Every time with you Potter adult, racist, homophobic, snyder and crypto bros. I’d say go to hell, but this place is way too good for you. Just stop complaining, you’re demons, you’ll figure a way out eventually.”


Group pulled at Kellan’s sleeve, then nodded towards the group of Demons. Kellan shook her head. “Please not today, Grorp.”


The ethereal demon sulked, kicking at a rock, but his foot going straight through. 


“Hell is cold as penguin shit,

Grorp needs some warmth in which to sit!”


“Why don’t you sit on this?” One of the Demons yelled as he held up a middle finger. “Fuck you and your  little homo ghost, you bitch!”


Kellan sighed, before looking down at her companion and nodding. At the gesture, Grorp rushed to the red demons, baring teeth. He slithered along the ground as his prey protested, before the little one misted into them, through their skin. Screams sounded as demon limbs were torn from bodies from the inside, torrents of blood and rocks spraying from the mound.


Kellan looked away, but in truth she had become numb to it after being here all this time, Group had said that time wired in an odd way here, that time past simultaneously felt like an eternity and no time at all, as if being untethered from time was agony in and of itself. She understood, who knows how long it had been since she had seen Oryx, HUM13, Ash? The confusion fogged her mind like Elon Musk’s mind seems to fog when someone asks him if his family’s secret illegal emerald mines has given him a distinct amount of white privilege and more than a leg up.


A series of squelching, wet, sucking sounds came from behind her, louder and louder as they approached. She turned, to see the parts of the demons had been reassembled into a flesh mech that Grorp was piloting. The flesh puppet smirked, dead eyes and teeth not really conveying anything other than a sickening terror.


“It doesn’t matter how much I see you do your possession stuff, Grorp, I hate it.” Kellan picked up her bag and started to move her hands in the sulphury air, until Grorp put a blood covered, fingerless hand on her shoulder.


“To find your sister we must cross,

Into the lands where Beefcurtain’s boss.”


Kellan looked down at Grorp with a sneer. “Beefcurtain? Who in the proverbial…here…is Beefcurtain?”


As if in response, a wide shard of light split the murky sky, emanating from a point ten miles of fire and rock and misery away. In the shaft of light a little nerdlinger demon of fire and flames appeared.


“Coming to you live from the Castle of Two Dragons Doing it Raw Style, the Mistress of Malcontent, the Leader of…Loving to Kill, the General of Generally Being Too Amazing, the Duchess of Double Ds…Ah!”


A hand came from out of frame and pushed Spelgor aside. “Get out of my way, you irksome little queef. I know you are out there, little Kellan.” She hissed. “If you wish to see your sister again, you’ll come to me.”


***


The Queen smiled thinly as Florgo was led into the room by Spelgor, who held a chain that wrapped around the mage’s neck. She knew what he wanted, access to one of the magical items she had confiscated from him after he first returned to her years ago. The ones he had forged for himself in this hell dimension: His black book covered by demon skin which he called the mageonomicon, the amulet made from the skull of a small demon dog that barked when people were lying, the staff he had fashioned from the hanging tree, or the other staff from a shard of cooled magma, or the other staff he had made from that staff he had found in a carpark during one of the illegal dark mage street duels that had become all the rage these days. Look, the guy had a lot of staves. What, you think because the title of the episode is ‘Banking and Staffs’, I didn’t know that the plural of staff was ‘staves’ when referring to a weapon or magical staff? Well buckos, you have to get up pretty early in the morning to get one over on me. I could’ve changed the title of the episode, but I wanted to give my fellow hosts the option of writing about staffs like sets of employees. I’m sure with their long histories of office work that they did the honourable thing, not let me down and did just that, didn’t you boys…(pause for Josh and Jeff to invariable say no, then interrupt them with)...I thought so. Synergy!


“So, she’s the one you escaped hell for? She’s the one you went to help?”


When Florgo didn’t answer, Spelgor yanked on his choke chain. “Answer her bouncybreastedness, you boring worm!”


Beefcurtain leaned forward. “No, no, Spelgor, we only want what’s best for my beloved. He can never leave again, so we need to retrain him, like the dog he is.”


Florgo gave her dagger eyes. “I’ll never serve you. I’m loyal to Kellan.”


“Really?! You don’t fool me little man. How many bags do you carry for some hope that she’ll suck on your bag?”


Florgo sneered. “It’s not like that. It was never like that.”


Beefcurtain smirked, and Florgo wanted to murder her all over again. “I’ve heard of playing the long game, Florgo, but everyone else is playing chess, and you’re playing ice ages. By the time she wants your dick, it won’t be good for anything but pissing yourself in a care home.”


Florgo pulled against his chains again, only for them to bite into his neck. “She’ll see my value eventually, I’m good for her.”


Beefcurtain laughed. “Oh god, you believe you’re better than this, don’t you? You’re a demon born, who got too friendly with one of our residents from the Veil once they found their way here. They told you about the glorious Kellan who started their colony, and then you went back in time to slither your way into her life. You’re not Kyle Reece, moron, you’re a certified creeper! You’re the toxic man who thinks a woman owes him love simply because he was normal around her, aren’t you?”


“No, that’s not…”

“I’ll bet you lied to her too, perhaps you told her you were from the Veil yourself, hoping that if she fell in love with you, the lie wouldn’t seem so bad when you were together.”


Florgo shook his head, she was twisting things. Of course she was, she was one of those sorts of women. “I was…I was trying to protect her…”


Beefcurtain laughed. “Did little Kellan ask for that? You said you sent her sister here, did you think she’d welcome you back with open legs?”


“No, that’s not what I…” He protested.


“You bore me Florgo. I already have plenty of would-be woman saviours in my Andrew Tate section of hell, next to the pussy grabbers, the overbearing ‘protectors’, and the ones who follow women to make sure they get home safely, hoping to make them feel less safe in the bedroom. You’re the worst of them all though, the ones who don’t even realise they’re terrible. At least Andrew Tate had a podcast, at least he was producing something. The only thing you’re producing is grade A horseshit, and you,my boy, are huffing what you’re shovelling. Why would she want you? Why would she even look twice at you?”


“Because I deserve her love! ” He blurted out, then realised what he had said. His hands shot to his mouth, and he sank to his knees. Beefcurtain came to stand by his kneeling, wreck of a body, then placed her hand on the back of his head. 


“And that’s why you belong in Hell.” Beefcurtain smiled.


***


Kellan marched on past the multitude of DMVs on the banks of the lava river, the lines of skeletons who were once living beings before they got in the line that never seemed to move, Grorp walking along behind her from his suit of demon parts. They were less than a few hours from Beefcurtain’s castle, the orgasm face of the dragon skeleton staring them down.


Kellan sped up, desperate. “She must have Asher with her, how else would she know my name?”


“Your point is true, but please remember

Beefcurtain is Queen of hell and ember.


Her minions are the most reviled

Like Rich Masters’ only child!”


Kellan squinted. “Who the hell is Rich…”


A razor sharp, rectangular shape embedded itself in the rocky path at Kellan’s feet, and she pushed Grorp’s fleshy mech into the cover of some outcropping of stone to one side of the path.


“Come out girly, we gots ya surrounded.” A middleaged man in a postal uniform shouted. 


Kellan poked her head out from the rock, and another metal rectangle flew towards her, damn near slicing her face off. Sharp pain brought her hand to her face, and she brought it away again to see blood on her fingers. At once she darted to the metal object, pulling it from the rock and turning it over in her hands, almost slinging her finger open on the sharp edge. It was a miniature letter-shuriken, with the words ‘Magic Bitch’ printed where the address would normally be found. 


She ducked back quickly, as another two letters embedded themselves into the outcropping by her head. 


“Special delivery!” The postie yelled, and then a giant box smashed down near Kellan and Florgo, whatever was inside smashing to splinters, even though the box was marked ‘This Way Up’.


“Leave some would be corpses for de rest ov us, Herr Postie Dracula.” Came a familiar voice.


“Oh no.” Said Kellan, as she lifted her head above their cover. There were two men standing on an elevation ten meters to their left. A large, muscular troll with a giant sword stood with his arms crossed, disinterested, but alongside him stood Hitlerbot, aiming a chaingun at them. 


“Oh ya, Freulein! You may haff turned me into un lemon and killed me with your band of cretins before, but this time I em not so easily destroyed!” He fired a volley of fire from the chaingun which reduced the rock to rubble. As Hitlerbot came to inspect the rubble with a foot, he found nothing but metal letters and broken rock. “Scheisse.” He whispered.


A rift opened above Postiedracula, and a giant mess of limbs descended upon him, pummelling him to the floor. “I’ve always wanted to wipe that stupid smile off your face, Deliveryman.” Grorp said as he punched the Postie across the mouth, splitting his lip. The Postie rolled away and flashed another two metal letters towards Grorp, slicing through his flesh puppet and severing parts off him. Grorp looked down to find the fingers missing from his right hand and looked up at his adversary in shock.


“Let’s trim the fat a little.” Postiedracula smiled, licking his lips where he was bleeding, his collar popped like a Dracula.


Grorp marched on with arms outstretched, as waves of metal letters tore chunks from him. One arm was lost, then a foot, then part of Grorp’s meat puppet head. In shock, Grorp roared and lunged at the demon. In response, a metal letter split Grorp right between the shining eyes.


“Grorp!” Kellan yelled, and Hitlerbot turned as Kellan cracked him across the arm with Doomcock. He fired wildly, but she had already rifted away, only for another portal to open directly behind him. She rolled out, taking a swipe at his ankle and sending him to his knee, then dived towards another portal. He aimed at the floor and fired too late, creating a crater that followed her into the portal.


“Verdammt little rat, how dare you treat me with such disdain, I am your better! I love children and animals and am a vegetarian! I paint, und got the trains running on time!” he screamed.


Portal after portal opened and closed, hammer hits raining down on the Ferrous Fuhrer, until Hitlerbot got lucky and grabbed her mid-rift. “You are mine, little pest. I’m going to grind you into ash, und zen mix you into my bland porridge, because Hitlerbot does not like anything that makes his porridge less white!” Kellan struggled for air, then noticed Doomcock on the floor under her. She waved her hand, and Doomcock vanished, before it came slamming down on his back, severing his hydraulics and slumping him forward to the ground. He spluttered, his face flat against the rocky terrain. 


“I haff oiled my moustache, and am getting small pieces of rock in it, this is intolerable! I demand to be helped up, I am part of history.”


Kellan stood over him, casting a dark shadow over him. “Time to rejoin it, you skidmark.” She lifted the hammer like a golf club and swung away, taking his head off and sending it into the lava river. The droid body powered down and fizzled out.


Lord Uruk the transdimensional troll came sauntering up to Kellan, took one look at the carnage around him, and said. “Look man, I’m not interested in beef with you one iota. I’m just gonna scram, ok, bye!” He ran off at a pace, and Kellan watched him go, thankful she didn’t have to fight a baby eating troll.


A blast of energy took Kellan off her feet, and when she found the energy to turn around, through the black spots in her vision, she saw a supremely attractive woman with a scorpion tail walking towards her in Doc Martens and leather. She dragged a chain behind her, that was shackled to a reedy thin, hooded prisoner.


“So you’re the perky little bitch who thinks she’s such hot shit?” The woman purred seductively. “You don’t look like much. Plain Jane with delusions of grandeur, I don’t see what he sees in you to be honest, but lots of men like inferior women they can boss around.” anyhow, I kill people that challenge my authority, regardless of how inferior they are to the glory of Beefcurtain.”


Kellan coughed and tasted blood, the blast having cracked a few ribs. “I don’t want anything but my sister. If I have her, I’ll go, you have my word.”


Beefcurtain laughed. “Sister?! What sister? I’m afraid if some little girl had arrived, I’d have fed her to the dogs already. It was all a plot to draw you out, silly girl.” 


Kellan swallowed. So obvious, so stupid, she had fallen for it so easily. Without Ash to point out to her to be cautious, she had let her emotions walk her into something dangerous. But in the pile of things that bothered her, one thing stuck out more than any other. “How did you know about my sister in the first place?”


Rows of jagged teeth flashed in Beefcurtain’s wide smile. “When people rudely come here by magical portal, I get pretty tetchy. The only holes that should open here are the ones I poke in people. So I messed around with you Rifts a little. I swapped your order of arrival. The first one to enter the portal hasn’t even arrived yet, and the last gave me a bit of info on you so you’d save his skin…” She gestured and flicked the chain with her tail so Florog crashed to the floor in front of Kellan. “Yes, boy, I knew your stupid little plan to save yourself. Tell me again how selfless and wonderful you are.”


Kellan reached forward and pulled his hood back, to see the scarred and broken face underneath. He smiled at her. “I’m so sorry.” He muttered. Kellan pulled him close as he sobbed into her skins, pitying him and his abuse in the years he had been here.


Beefcurtain yanked at Florgo’s chokechain and he flew backwards. “Oh stop it, the misery is getting me horned up.” She turned, as PostieDracula arrived next to her, a forearm of Grorp’s mech demon in his own, a sharp jagged point of bone sticking out of one end.


“It is done.” He muttered, his eyes closed in satisfaction.


“Fucking took your sweet time didn’t you?” She tutted. “Still at least one of you was able to get the job done. Do me a favour and take out the trash would you?” She said, gesturing nonchalantly with a wave to Kellan.


“Yes, betrothed.” Postiedracula opened his glowing eyes, and slashed the forearm of bone along her neck. Blood sprayed from the slit along her jugular, and she collapsed to the dusty floor.


“Grorp?” Kellan wheezed. As Grorp walked the Postie’s body into the lava river before ghosting out of it.


Kellancrawled to Flrogo and rifted part of the metal collar away so he could remove it from around his neck. “Once she had gotten to his feet, she looked his burned, scarred face over. “Don’t take this the wrong way, but you look like a 3D birdseye map of a scrotum.”


“Nice to see you too.” he muttered. “Suppose there’s no chance for us now, huh?”

Kellan shook her head. “I’m sorry, too much has, I just don’t…”


He held a hand up. “Don’t. I’m just…I’m glad you're safe.”


“How?” Beefcurtain splutered, holding her neck, blood pouring tween her fingers. “How did you get a demon to follow you?”


Florgo wafted a hand and ‘Grorp’ ghosted back into him, back home where the part of his soul he had cleaved off to help his friend belonged.


“Save me. Save me and I’ll give you what you want.” Beefcurtain gasped. “I can bring your sister here now.”


“You’ll do it, or I’ll Rift your head from your body.” Asher said coldly. 


Beefcurtain opened a Rift in the sky above them, the young Asher dropping directly into Kellan’s waiting arms. Ash looked at her in shock. “Later.” Kellan whispered.


She turned and walked away, urging Florgo to go come with her. “Leave her. She doesn’t deserve our mercy.”


Beefcurtain howled in anger, and brought her hands together, mustering every ounce of power she had left, and a little pent up sexual frustration, aiming it directly for the three of them. A bolt of pure red energy sped towards them, only for Florgo to push Kellan and sh to one side. The bolt took him, a Rift opening inside him. As Kellan tried to close the portal, the part of his soul he called Grorp was almost pulled directly from him. Closing her hands, Kellan pushed the Rift closed, watching Florgo fall to the floor in a heap of curled up limbs. Kellan aimed a Rift in Beefcurtain’s direction, but the Queen of Hell was near death, her emaciated husk nothing more than skin wrapped around bone.


She rushed to Florgo, pulling him up. His form was warped and bent, his features twisted and broken. “Grorp.” He whispered. “Grorp” His eyes rolled back, and the breath left his lungs.


“Florgo?” Kellan called, fighting back tears as she shook him. “Florgo?”


His dead eyes looked out at her, and she looked away, unable to meet them. She lay his dead body down at her feet, scooped Asher up, and pointed to the floor. Electricity crackled underfoot, and a Rift tore open. Beefcurtain laughed, a husky gurgle that sounded painful.


“Kellan, who was that?” Asher asked.


“A friend.” Kellan said, looking back as she walked through the portal.

The pitter patter of dog paws skittered across the rocky terrain.  “Hoo boy. You sure did mess this up kid.” Malcolm said.


“Heeeeelp meeee.” Beefcurtain hissed.


But he trotted past her on his scaly hindlegs, his giant lizard tail wafting at her reaching hand. “Oh hush up. You lost kid. Have the good graces to know when you’re chopped liver.”


Malcolm bared his teeth, and sniffed Florgo’s corpse. “Now this one. This one I can work with.” as he whispered to Florgo’s, a thin thread of blue left his tongue and wiggled its way inside his ear canal.


Florgo gasped in air, his chest cavity expanding. He scrabbled to his hands and feet, vomiting black liquid all over the floor. 


“Mah boy, I have a little job for you. I want you to destroy time itself.” Malcolm smiled.


Florgo stood, his back hunched, his jaw twisted.

“I’ll do as asked with one request,

I’ll crush Kellan’s heart inside her chest.”

The Ward helped Grorp back to his feet, he stood straighter, taller. Ward looked at him. “Are you ok, Wrath?”


A sickening, sucking, squelch made Ward look down, and he saw the rolling pin sticking from his stomach. 


“Never. Better.” Grorp said as the Pillar slipped off the rolling pin and dropped to the floor, dead. “And call me Florgo.”


THE END
