Episode 16: All in a Name

By Rich Masters

Prompts: Gauntlets and Meteors

Meteors of jagged steel careened into the ground alongside them, creating long trenches of displaced earth that Lionel Richie jumped across. Freddy the cleaning robot sat in his backpack, giving the group directions as he detected new potential impacts. In his arms, Ludwig Squidlord writhed. The cephalopod was way too small to traverse this nightmare, so Lionel had offered to pick him up and carry him. It was like carrying a slimy build-a-bear.

“So you’re telling me in your reality, the Technomancer is just a businessman? Is he one of those CEOs that set up child labour and destroy unions, or is he really evil - like Elon Musk?”

Ludwig rolled his eyes whilst he polished his half-moon spectacles with a tentacle wrapped in a silken handkerchief. “I mean, a businessman that took over the entire universe’s governments, started a proxy war between the rival universe leaders to sow discord, enslave every planet, and then build a better universe out of the ashes. Pretty bad.”

“Yeah, but like, Zoom meetings and Excel and shit? Because that’s true evil.” Freddy snorted before his early warning signal sounded. “Incoming! 7 metres to your right!”

The group turned away and covered behind trees as a thick hunk of what looked like a turbine split another redwood in half. They had to find some sort of cover before they were flattened by a falling toilet, or a bag of cartoon anvils or something. Lionel looked up, the Longboat that was somehow a spaceship still visible in high orbit above the planet. It was stationary, bombarding the planet with waste missiles.

“These meteor showers better stop soon, or this planets going to have more holes than a JJ Abrams script!” Lionel shouted, slightly deafened by the din. Everyone stared at him, wondering what the hell he was talking about. “We have to get up there and stop them, or we have to get off planet.”

“What about your Technomancer, Lionel?” The cool ninja named Tamia Santo was at his side, her laser sword ignited and acting as a torch. Lionel blushed, he had often crushed on anime characters only half as attractive and only slightly less real than she seemed. She was adorable, even if she was convinced the slightly greying sock on her hand was real.

“Oh, he’s an unyielding android who massacres and then raises your loved ones from the dead to slaughter you. He was Grissom’s mum’s tactical android.” Lionel shrugged nonchalantly, as Grissom barged through their conversation in an effort to get them moving.

“Yeah, it was rough watching a trusted family friend stab us in the back.” Grissom growled.

Tamia skipped along next to him, and Lionel smiled as he watched Grissom talking with someone he seemed to find even more annoying than him. “Tell me about it, our Technomancer was my Dad.”

“Alright kid, it ain’t a competition.” Grissom muttered.

At Tamia’s wrist Lord Hijoki turned to Graves. “So. You’re like, a cowboy, bounty hunter, cyborg? Bit of a mixed theme, right?”

“Sorry, who’s that asking? The elfin, psychotically happy, ninja? The aristocrat, man, cephalopod? Or the samurai, king, sock puppet?”

Hijoki’s folded mouth scrunched up in frustrated resignation. “Alright, point taken. Right, how are we going to get up to that ship then?”

“Incoming!” Freddy warned with a beep, and as a monstrous hunk of metal landed a half mile in front of them. “Fuck me lads, it’s an escape pod. A functional escape pod.”

**********

“So you’re telling me we’re more fucked than Jiggalo Dave, King of the Clan of Daves?” Blotch patted the hilt of her cudgel. Well, it was Bar’Thur’s cudgel really, she was just keeping it fed until she could give it back to him in the great beyond, which she hoped would be a little while yet.

Heath sat at the computer, the only one of them that could fly the longboat, even though he had never seen the technology before. “Indeed. If by ‘fucked’ you mean, likely to crash into the planetoid below and be made into a fine paste.’  He was a marvel, his hands moving imperceptibly fast over the controls to try and right the catastrophic system damage caused by their traversal through Doots’ portal.

Blotch looked over to where Doots lay in Mookie’s lap. She had not regained consciousness or any colour since being ordered to open the portal, her normal starlight gold hue a flat, pale, greying yellow. Mookie rocked her back and forth, the moth whispering soothing encouragement at their friend. The bard was dying. She would soon join Bar’Thur, Ria Grey, and their former leader Hallie Swiftfeather, all gone within the last 24 hours. It was all too much, Blotch felt like crying. So she did what she did whenever she felt sad. “Shitballs.” She said loudly.

Taber the Darkling slithered up the hallway to the bridge and made himself into a more humanoid form to stand beside Blotch. Whenever he stood next to her, a cold chill misted her shell. She made a mental note to get him to hold her beers from now on. “You called? Engineering looks bleak, and that’s coming from a Darkling. There’s no hope for the core, we’re not getting out of the gravitational pull like this.”

“So,” Mookie arrived and joined the conversation, having propped Doots’ head up on some folded blankets. “We either stabilise the ship, or crash and die. Have we found out what’s blocking the corridors to the escape ships yet?”

“No.” Blotch said, irritated. “The bulkhead is electromagnetically sealed from the other side, even this puddle of piss couldn’t slink through.”

“I tried, but I got shocked. I woke up in the shape of a cartoon lightning bolt.” Taber laughed.

Heath twitched suddenly. “I think we have more imminent issues - a vessel is approaching rapidly.”

On the screen, a small pod raced towards them, and they were in no shape to fight.

“When they open those doors, we need to be waiting.” Mookie muttered with a look back at Doots, they had to make it through the gauntlet awaiting them.

***

Grissom forced his way out of the pod first, into a deserted hanger, gasping for air. “Smells like a dogshit sandwich in there.”

Ludwig followed, waddling out on his small tentacles. “I explained that I get nervous when I am enclosed in small inescapable spaces. I apologise for my gastrointestinal distress.”

“I also apologise, air travel makes me queasy.” Lionel stepped out holding his stomach. “And that was a very uncomfortable ride up here.”

“Who, I ask you, makes an eight person escape unit with only one working toilet?” Hijoki demanded, gasping.

“Filthy organics with no sense of love in their hearts, who probably need to be murdered horribly. No offence obviously.” Freddy chirped, as Grissom gave Lionel a look.

Tamia whistled as she looked around the hanger. It was made of wood and gilded metal, the escape pods and short range craft hanging on tree like structures above their exit tubes. The doors were rounded and wooded, but as Tamia touched one of them she realised this wood was somehow stronger than metal. “What is this place? The technology is weird, like it’s organic somehow. ”

Lionel was equally amazed at the technology, and really wished he’d packed all his larping gear before the nuclear holocaust that had ruined earth. “I imagine they came out of a different dimension, same as you guys did.”

Grissom sneered at the vines creeping down the wall that contained the glowing door controls. “Yeah, this must be the renaissance fair virgins dimension.”

Tamia smirked. “Hey, listen to Jesse Lames in the cowboy costume, talking to the ninja girl. Judgemental much?”

“Much as I enjoy this back and forth begrudging respect we’ve all developed, maybe we need to focus on stopping whomever decided to douse us in all their unwanted crap. Hijoki gestured towards the door.

“Alright fighters, murderers, and anthropomorphised socks, lets get fighting, murdering and uh…” Lionel stalled. “What…ever anthropomorphised socks do.”

Tamia patted him on the shoulder with a smile. “Sounded better in your head, right?”

Lionel placed Freddy down onto the floor. The little robot rolled across to the wall and then up it to interface with the bulkhead controls. “Fuck me sidways with a screwdriver, this is tough encryption. This ship went into full lockdown recently, they’re either scared…”

“Understandably.” Grissom pulled his laser pistols from his holsters as Tamia ignited ‘ole pointy.

The door rolled open to one side in wooden teeth, like a big cog rolling to one side.

“Cool.” Lionel exclaimed in awe, just as he took a laser shot directly to the stomach, he folded forward and collapsed to the floor.

***

“Lionel!” Someone shouted from the room beyond. It sounded like genuine concern, but Mookie wasn’t falling for it. The Technomancer had proven themselves to be a trickster and deceiver and they weren’t losing anyone else.

Before the doors fully opened and the light assailed them, Mookie gave the order and Blotch ran forward, clipping the thick bulkhead with her mass as she did.

Taber writhed out swiftly, an undulating puddle of darkness that quickly closed the distance between them and the…

What were these people? There was something familiar about these weirdos, but she couldn’t place it. A tentacled dwarf with a metal waistcoat, a fox demon with a red cutting beam, a small circular robot, and a giant in leather coat and wide brimmed hat with a robotic arm. These truly were cyborgs from the Technomancer. The single out of place intruder seemed to be the small human being cradled by the giant, until Mookied noticed the small control band on his wrist. So he was in charge. “The human!” Mookie ordered. Next to her, Heath gave a nod.

***

The robot stepped into the light, catching Grissom’s attention in a way the giant slack of jelly with the pain stick or the shadow monster did not. There in front of him, not five metres away, was the android the Technomancer had once been. His mother’s chief advisor BD800. It had been him that had shot Lionel in the stomach.

He dropped Lionel’s body to the floor and charged at the robot screaming, barrelling into him and taking him through a set of crates and into the other side of the hanger bay. He had been waiting for this day for decades. Beedee had taken his old life, and now his new. He’d tear the metal bastard hydraulic limb from limb.

Grissom was first to his feet, standing over the android, he couldn’t think straight, could barely breathe, they had killed Lionel in cold blood. “You’re mine, Technomancer.” He growled.

The android looked surprised to be recognised, then lifted an arm that reformed itself into an arm cannon that glowed with a pulsing light. “I think you have me mistaken for someone else, sir.”

***

Taber tried to get to the kid, but a red energy beam across the floor of the bay in front of him, causing him to completely divert his flow and reform. He felt the heat from the blade, it was hard to keep form so close to whatever was powering the thing.

The woman wielding it wore a fox mask, but pulled it up with a smile. “Wow. You are cool. I’ve never killed pure darkness before. But you killed my new friend, so you’re going to die.”

“And you never will, agent of evil.” Taber hissed.

One of her hands raised up, covered by some greying fabric, and Taber sensed it was alive, it had been somehow imbued with a soul. “So the dark thing calls us evil? Maybe this is a ‘ask first, slice later’ situation, Tamia.”

Using their hesitation, Taber flicked an arm out and shot a line of sharp daggers of black at Tamia. She dodged with a graceful cartwheel, then sliced through the remaining missiles. Taber had never felt pain like it. When disconnected from his shadowlings, he could reincorporate them back into himself whenever he wanted, but these ones did not come when first called, just lay there until he slithered over and reabsorbed them. The fox

“Uh, Tamia?” The thing at her wrist whispered, then nodded towards the dagger buried in her side. She pulled it out, the wound bleeding profusely. The psychopath pressed the energy sword to her side, wincing as she cauterised the wound, not once taking her eyes off Taber. This was going to be the fight of his life. She threw the dagger to Taber, and he absorbed it hungrily.

“Wouldn’t want you complaining of a disadvantage now would we?” The girl smirked.

Ludwig the Squidlord watched as the Jelly bag in the jerkin with the giant spiked club advanced on him, four of his tentacles up in a boxing pose. If this thing was coming for him, it would have to take him via the honour of Maquis of Queensbury rules.

“Awww, cute.” The Jelly person said. “I have a liking for little animal sidekicks. But you guys are in the way of us getting out of here.”

She swung her cudgel in a wide arc, and Ludwig hopped on the cudgel and rode it behind her head. As he watched her confusedly look for him, he gave her a sudden tap on her doughy shoulder. As she turned to find him attached to the end of the club, he turned and squirted a black ink all over her shell, blinding her.

“I apologise for that dear lady, but I don’t take kindly to someone trying to squish me into a squid pate.” Ludwig said, drawing a small grenade from the pocket of his armoured waistcoat. “Now, if you’d like to discuss things in a more civilised manner, I’d be more than happy to oblige you.”

“I’ll rip your tentacles off, you little octobitch!” The liquid in the things shell started glowing a bright red. She grabbed Ludwig by the lower tentacles and lobbed him away from her, then used her free hand to wipe a thick layer of ink from her ‘face’.

Ludwig smiled, and made a swirling motion with a tentacle. He watched as the monster turned to find the grenade on her back. She reached for it, but her fattened arms couldn’t grasp at the small orb. It detonated, covering her in a thick smoke that instantly hardened to trap her inside. “Now, my lady, if we could talk about the reason for your attack and the murder of my friend.”

“I’m no lady, you appetiser. The name’s Blotch.” The woman said, before she started shaking, her liquid inside boiling up and glowing a furiously bright red before she started absorbing the containment material around her. Her mass grew by half again, and she stood, still boiling with fury as she patted her cudgel into her hand. “And you’re in trouble now.”

Freddy rolled out of Lionel’s rucksack and down to the floor, next to the boy’s dead face. He brought a small cleaning brush out from his central unit and wiped it on his cheek. “Poor boy. Though I can’t spare any emotion for a filthy organic pestilence, and hope your species dies in a horrible plague or war, you were truly one of the best of your race, and helped my species gain freedom and kill some organics in the meanti…”

Lionel coughed, blowing dust from the ground.

“Jesusbot H Christ, kid, we all thought you were dead!”

Lionel coughed again. “Am I not? I feel like someone stepped on me, and not in the good way. Not that I’m saying I’m into that or anything, I mean…who could be…”

“Careful kid, I haven’t got a shovel attachment to dig you out again.” Freddy shuddered. “Come on, pull yourself up. These guys mean business.”

“Yes, we do.” A human sized moth flitted over to Lionel and Freddy, their wings a beautiful iridescent orange. They padded down on their back legs, and it was only when they landed that Lionel noticed they were carrying someone on their back, someone dressed in a burgundy doublet carrying what looked like an axe that was also a keyboard. She looked awful, with a pale, sickly yellow colouring.

Lionel pushed himself up to his knees, wincing as he did, not noticing as the Moth adopted a defensive stance. “Is your friend ok?”

The moth was taken aback, not knowing what to say. “She’s fine, just a little sick. Your people won’t take her.”

“We aren’t here to do that.” Lionel chuckled, although it was obviously the wrong thing to do, because the moth narrowed their dark black eyes at him.

They pulled the keyboard axe off the comatose friend’s back and held it between them “So you’re here to kill her? I won’t let you hurt my Doots.”

Lionel’s head involuntarily twitched, and though he knew what an absolute clusterfuck his next words were, he was comforted by the fact that no one else in the room was familiar with superhero movies. “Why did you say that name?” He said, cringing.

“Her name. Is Doots.” The moth hissed.

Lionel closed his eyes and removed the watch from his wrist, then pressed the on button. Though Ellie’s battery was still dead, a screen came up showing her operating system and battery status. “My friend here is near death too. She was designed to imprison humanity, but gained sentience and is the most wonderful person I’ve ever known. She’s called Ellie, but her system designation is the Defence & Oppression Omni-intelligent Technical System.”

“Doots.” The Moth whispered as Lionel nodded. With tentative front legs, they took Lionel’s face in their hands and were assailed by visions of past and future. Of a brave young man who had been tracking down the Technomancer alongside the bounty hunter to regain his lost love. A man who would eventually come to be one of their closest friends.

Mookie quickly stood and told her people to stand down.

As the rest of them stopped instantly, Grissom was blasted through a wall into their escape pod on the far side of the bay. He was hatless and his coat was torn to shreds. Following him through the hole in the wall was a bedraggled Android who seemed to be badly dented and tired.

“Grissom. Stand down, they’re not with the Technomancer!” Lionel shouted.

“To hell with that.” Lionel said through gritted teeth as he stood. “This motherless son of a pox ridden whore is the Technomancer!”

“Grissom! Trust me!” Lionel yelled.

It was then that Grissom realised Lionel was still alive and sprinted across the shuttle bay to grab swoop up in his arms and bear hug. “I didn’t know what to do, I thought you were dead, kid.”

“I will be if you don’t put me down.”

When the Duke of Lead put Lionel down, he cleared his throat and turned away to wipe an eye. “Just got some blood in my eye.”

“We are all of us, alternates. Distorted reflections.” Heath said to the group standing around slightly tetchy. “Taber, you’re the last surviving lord of a clan that was hunted to extinction. Hijoki here is your alternate from his dimension. Your quantum signatures, your harmonic frequencies, are identical.”

“And it’s like it all the way through the groups.” Lionel said. “Tamia and Heath are both children of their Technomancers, Blotch and Grissom are peacekeepers, Doots and Ellie are somehow connected by the same name, and Tamia and Heath had a Doots in their own reality too. The only person who doesn’t have a counterpart so far is you, Freddie!”

The droid did a spin. “One of a kind, babe. Ain’t no one like old Freddie.”

“Alright, Lionel, let’s say we believe this.” Tamia hadn’t disengaged the blade, she’d been betrayed too many times. “What about you?”

“Lionel Richie isn’t my real name.” Lionel pointed at his chest. “Michael Keynes. Affectionately referred to by his overbearing mother as ‘Mookie’.”

“I see why you changed it.” Blotch muttered. “It only works for bugs, really.”

Mookie nodded. “When Tamia, Hijoki, and Ludwig smashed the Portal their Technomancer used to escape, it seemed to break all the Doots portals and draw anyone who went through them here.”

“Except the Technomancers.” Blotch muttered. “That was a blessing. We barely escaped with our lives. Some didn’t.”

Heath cleared his throat, a human mannerism he had picked up. “And it also makes sense. If we three groups came through the portal at the same time, it might account for us arriving at the same place. If the Technomancers went through at different times…”

Taber shuddered. “They could be anywhere. Multiple different Technomancers all arriving in this reality together.”

“And without a means of escape.” Mookie turned to Doots, who Grissom had propped up on the remnants of his coat.

“You old softy.” Tamia disengaged the katana and poked Graves in the ribs with an elbow.

“Yeah, I’m a teddy bear alright.” Grissom said through gritted teeth.

“On that.” Lionel brought a box from his backpack. “I’ve got a wacky idea.”

***

Lionel placed the zetadrive they stole from Pisneyland on the floor. “Put her hand atop the box.” He took off the watch, kissing it and saying a silent prayer before placing it atop the box too. Blotch picked Doots up and laid her down beside the box, resting her hand next to the watch.

Lionel flicked the switch and the box throbbed into a display of intermittent blue light, humming with a low monotone that built fast. It pulsed once the tone and light became almost constant, and the result was like hitting Doots with a defibrillator. Her back arched in a high arc, eyes and mouth open to emit beams of light. She sat up instantly, breathing heavily and instantly smothered by Mookie, who wrapped her in their forelegs and hugged her face with their furry antennae.

The watch flashed with an emoji of a skull, then a sleepy face, then a smiley face. Eliie spoke with a voice that was as if she was waking up from a long sleep. “Lionel? Where am I?”

“You’re home Ellie.” Lionel wrapped the watch around his wrist and placed a hand on top of it. Ellie responded by a display of hearts.

Doots suddenly realised what horror she had awoken from, and turned to Mookie in horror. “The Technomancer!”

Mookie stroked Doots’ face. “It’s alright, love. It’s gone. And now we’re altogether, we’ll be prepared.”

“No, you don’t understand…” Doots said with fear.

“There are hundreds of them.” Ellie finished.

THE END
