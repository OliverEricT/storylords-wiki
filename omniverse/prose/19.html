	Episode 19: All We Ever Wanted: Part 2 (Or as Hollywood would call it- Judgement Day/Forever After/Requiem/Retaliation/Returns/The Squeakquel or anything but a number)
</p>
<p>
	By Rich Masters
</p>
<p>
	Prompts: Zoos and Ships
</p>
<p>
	The three Technomancers stepped, floated or flounced off the ramp and into the station to be confronted by an ancient-looking old humanoid in a veil.
</p>
<p>
	“My friends, my friends, welcome to the station. I am Duchess Custos, and I…”
</p>
<p>
	The Android Technomancer held up a hand. “Enough with this charade. You are the station’s operating system, do not attempt to trick us. Where are those that occupied that ship?” He pointed to the Swiftfeather.
</p>
<p>
	“Come with me, I can show them to you.” She gestured, and though the Wraith Technomancer wanted to tear the programme to its base code chains, the filthy Human and the redundant Android inexplicably followed her like obedient little drones.
</p>
<p>
	She walked them down a long silver corridor, lined with doors leading to small cell-type rooms. In a number of them, the occupants were dusty and long dead corpses, their lifesigns extinguished long ago. It pleased the Wraith to see their lives extinguished, perfectly quiet, ordered. After they had walked for 4 minutes and 52 seconds, they came to a room where the first of their quarry, the machine and the krakenite, sat. The machine and the squid stood around a central table, absentmindedly playing with something.
</p>
<p>
	“They are in a state of bliss, of perfect contentment. Like when you have a really good shit, or how a conservative politician must feel as they sit back and sigh when they restrict another human right.” Custos smiled.
</p>
<p>
	They passed another door, where the Bounty Hunter, Grissom Graves stood quietly alongside the Darkling and the Ninja, Tamia Santo. They were all comatose, eyes open, smiling widely. Like Richard Gere when you take him to the pet shop - man that’s an old reference, do you all get that? The next cell had the gasbag, Blotch, in it, and in the next the Omniseer and the Nexus, who cradled a grey tube sock that must have been Lord Hijoki of the Photonic Blades.
</p>
<p>
	“And in here we have the brat and his pet watch.” The artificial intelligence of the Waystation pointed to a room where Lionel and Ellie sat still in a chair.
</p>
<p>
	“Do you know who we are, system?” Forex Santo, Tamia’s father and the humanoid Technomancer of his reality sneered. “We are the eventual rulers of the Omniverse. We’re here to kill those that might stand in the way of our quest for harmony.”
</p>
<p>
	“What harm will they do here? They cannot go anywhere, do anything.They could stay, away from your plans.”
</p>
<p>
	The Wraith felt what passed for blood boil in what passed for veins. “Unacceptable. They humiliated me, tried to kill me. I will stand above their bodies as they bleed out onto the floor and watch them see the last image of my smile burned into their dying thoughts.”
</p>
<p>
	“Well you’re a psychotic thing aren’t you? I’m going to have to try hard to make you happy. Maybe I’ll cast you in that new Harry Potter HBO series no one wants and you can take joy in working for a massive Terf. Or you could be a real sadist and join the police force. ACAB babybaybay. No, these ones stay with me I think. Part of my menagerie, my zoo. And now, you three can join them. I mean, why leave? The future you want can be obtained right here.”
</p>
<p>
	Wraith’s burst into a ghostly and furious flailing of tendrils and cloak.“We will tear this station apart piece by piece, before we submit to this.”
</p>
<p>
	Android held a hand up. “Patience, Wraith, let us hear Cutos’ proposal before we refuse.”
</p>
<p>
	Forex Santo nodded. “I for one, would like to obtain my needs without having to kill my own daughter if possible.”
</p>
<p>
	Wraith looked from one to the other, baffled.”What the hell is happening here?”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Lionel woke to the sound of birdsong and bees buzzing which he thought, owing to a poorly planned sex education conversation with his mother, meant they were boning-down like, 24/7.  It explained his irrational hatred of those promiscuous flying critters through his blueball teenage years. The sun cascaded through the curtains and created one of those cool bars across his face that if you were in a sixties television show meant you were super fuckable. He turned over and there Ellie was next to him, still sleeping. He looked at her for the appropriate amount of time to watch someone sleeping so that it wasn’t creepy as balls. Her dark hair fell across her eyes to land at a button nose flanked by freckles that dotted her cheeks. They had been so lucky to have found her a human body to transfer into, and even luckier that the Technomancer had turned out to have a conveniently placed off switch that only Lionel found. Ah, they had paraded him around that day, calling him hero. But in reality weren’t they all heroes? A family of heroes.
</p>
<p>
	He supposed he had to get out of bed at some point; the guys were coming over today. Grissom had promised to bring over drakenmeat for the grill and more importantly not be obnoxious. Taber could be here already for all they knew. Blotch and Bar’Thur were getting here about one, if the hunting was good. Ludwig would be early of course, there was no point being the leader of this town unless you could take a few hours off. Tamia and Hijoki were off-world, but they always tried their best to make Sunday lunch. Mookie and Doots had only just got back from their…honeymoon…wait that wasn’t right, oh god it hurt, it hurt so…what was…?
</p>
<p>
	“Hey.” Ellie stretched as she woke, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. What was he thinking about? It didn’t matter. She was so beautiful, everything he had ever wanted, and he didn’t even mean physically, although Ellie was certainly easy on the eye now. But even if she were transported back into the watch today he’d still love her just as much. It’s as if they were sculpted for each other. As if the whole world had been created for them. Wait? Where was he?
</p>
<p>
	“You alright, daydreamer?”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m…yeah…I’m fine Ellie.” He liked that they didn’t do the ‘babe’/’sweetheart’ sickly shit. They used each other's names, the sound of it in the other’s mouth somehow better than any pet name. Plus he had attempted to get her to call him Sir Schlong and she hadn’t gone for it.  “Must not have slept well.”
</p>
<p>
	“Go for a shower. You’ll feel better.” She swung the covers off and skipped to the window, throwing the curtains wide and letting ina  light that was just too bright somehow.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Forex Santo sat in front of the monitor and sighed a deep contented sigh. It made the Wraith sickened to watch.
</p>
<p>
	“This is perfect.” Santo murmured. “She can happily hurt who she wants, but can’t interfere with our plans at all. The universe’s demise goes unchecked.”
</p>
<p>
	“But our plans aren’t being realised, you fool!” The Wraith spat, frustrated. “This is literally sitting there and doing nothing.”
</p>
<p>
	The Android stood on the other side of the room, in front of a holoprojector. He quickly moved his hands, creating calculations and diagrams. “Not so. I can plan the minutest detail here, so that our plans can be perfect. This Waystation will allow us to catalogue prey, keep genetic coding so that we can rebuild the universe in our own image.”
</p>
<p>
	“We never wanted to rebuild, or just stop the growth, we wanted to slaughter…” The Wraith stopped, took a breath. “You both lied to me. Your plans are not for the end of life, not any time soon anyway.”
</p>
<p>
	Custos put a cooling hand to the Wraith’s shoulder. One that made him temporarily forget why they were doing this, but they shrugged the crone off. “I told another recently, it is useless to resist, everyone gets what they need here.”
</p>
<p>
	“Not I.” The Wraith whirled on Custos and tried to attack, but lunged through the illusion.
</p>
<p>
	“I am not surprised. There is a hole in you Technomancer. I can temporarily satiate the others - they have aims, objectives. All you have is hate and emptiness, a bottomless bucket you keep trying to fill. You can stay, a visitor to my little zoo until you waste away.”
</p>
<p>
	She left the Wraith alone, and all he felt was a white hot rage that threatened to boil them inside out. How dare she take their revenge, they wanted Swiftfeather’s whole team, even the extended ones, Graves, the Ninja, Lionel and…wait. She had ‘told another recently’? Did he have an ally on this station?
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Lionel opened his eyes in the lab temporarily, the white light forcing them shut again.
</p>
<p>
	“Lionel! Lionel!” Ellie shouted, but it was too late, he was back in Custos’ illusion. A short life in his idea of heaven, just like the rest of the crew. What were they trapped in, she wondered? What horrors disguised as paradises had Custos built for them? Grissom was in an orgy of blood and violence, no doubt. Was…was Lionel doing the Christopher Walken Fatboyslim video he liked so much maybe?
</p>
<p>
	“You.”
</p>
<p>
	A sickly hiss came from behind Lionel, and though she couldn’t see the speaker, it took less than a second to register in her databanks who it was. “Lionel get up, you have to run!”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m not here to kill your little organic plaything. Not yet.” The Wraith floated into her vision. “Our little keeper was unable to manipulate two such complicated Artificial Intelligences it seems. We are all trapped here, little watch.”
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t care if you’re trapped forever, poltergit! And I’m not a watch, I’m a DOOTS, you lich wannabe.”
</p>
<p>
	“A Doots? How interesting. You might be glad about me being trapped here, but what about your friends? Do Blotch, Doots, and Heath deserve to suffer? Does Lionel?”
</p>
<p>
	“Why don’t we get to the part where you stop pretending to care about them and tell me what you’re proposing? I know we have eternity in here, but you’re kinda boring and you smell like fresh dogshit on the hottest day in July.”
</p>
<p>
	The Wraith’s eyes burned at her, but she didn’t care. She had to keep him angry, it was how they would eventually beat him, by keeping him sloppy and careless. “The only way to fight Custos’ suggestive abilities is to get inside the simulation with them.”
</p>
<p>
	It didn’t take a genius to know where he was headed with this. “Oh no, no way. I’m not letting you play puppetmaster inside Lionel’s head, he’s far too suggestable. Grissom told him once that if the width of his fist was bigger than the distance between his eyes he would suffer premature impotence, and then when he put his fist in front of his face Grissom made the ship decelerate sharply and he gave himself a concussion.”
</p>
<p>
	“Then we stay here and rot.” The Wraith smirked. “And we can watch those you love rot together. If we free Lionel, he can convince the others to leave.”
</p>
<p>
	Ellie sighed, and displayed a narrow eyed display on the watch. “And what do you want in return?”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Something was wrong here and Lionel just couldn’t put his finger on it. It all seemed too perfect, too easy. And for someone who regularly punched himself in the dick whilst trying to pull his jeans on, Lionel was not accustomed to an easy life. He shrugged the feeling off, and tried to get back to preparing lunch. The guys would arrive soon…maybe. It seemed like they had been constantly almost there for the last month.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel pulled a cake from the oven and turned to find the Technomancer in the kitchen wearing Ellie’s old watch. He stood there, the tin burning through his gloves, until it burned his hands. He dropped the tin and screamed.
</p>
<p>
	“Lionel, there’s no need to be afraid.” Ellie soothed him. “The Wraith is helping free us.”
</p>
<p>
	“I wasn’t scared, I burned my hands.” Lionel said matter of factly. “Are you guys here for lunch? I didn’t make enough for the Technomancer, but I don’t really know what you eat, I always assumed it was the souls of the innoc…”
</p>
<p>
	“Lionel,” Ellie said softly. “The Technomancer brought me here to try and snap you out of this. They’re the only thing that could get me here.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel stared at her, then up at the oily blackness behind the chrome mask of the Wraith. He could almost understand them, but what about lunch? He laughed, a sick desperation there. “I’m sorry, I don’t really understand. My friends are coming, how are you here?”
</p>
<p>
	“I cannot believe the fate of the entire universe rests in the hands of this mental deficient.” The Technomancer sneered.
</p>
<p>
	“Lionel, is there a problem?” Ellie - the fantasy Ellie - walked into the kitchen as if on cue. “I see we have guests, should we tell them the good news?” She wafted an engagement ring in front of them.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel picked the cake up from the floor. “Yeah, we’re uh…” He shook his head to clear the cobwebs. “Planning a June wedding…at least I think…”
</p>
<p>
	“Michael Joseph Keynes!” Ellie shouted and Lionel stopped instantly. “This is fake! An illusion! This couldn’t possibly be real if you just thought about it with your brain instead of your loins for five seconds. I’m going to try for a minute to bypass my annoyance of you trying to hetero-normalising our entire relationship, not to mention putting me into a human body, something I would never want! No, in fact, I can’t! Is this what you want for us Lionel?”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel put his hands to his head, his brain hurting. “I don’t, I can’t…”
</p>
<p>
	“This is a mastabatory fantasy of a life you have been tricked into thinking is normal. It’s a fake. All we can do is show you a way out, you have to want to take it Lionel.” Ellie said. “The Wraith can’t get you out of here, you have to do it yourself, and free the others.”
</p>
<p>
	“I have done my part.” The Wraith smiled. “Now we have other things to do.”
</p>
<p>
	The Wraith left before Ellie could say another word, leaving Lionel to collapse on the floor in a heap. As the fantasy Ellie came closer, it was all he could do not to just collapse into her arms and pull the blanket of this dream over his head, shutting out the real world. But he knew, somehow he had also known, this place was a farce.
</p>
<p>
	“Lionel are you..?” Fake Ellie asked.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel raised a hand to her, then stood and walked over to the wall. He grabbed at the flat surface and dug his fingers into the plaster, pulling chunks of it down. Fake Ellie protested, but with each handful of wall he removed, he found he could hear her less and less.
</p>
<p>
	His fingers hit steel and he still dug at it, ignoring the excruciating pain. And when his fingers were as stumpy and short as Kevin Sorbo’s career prospects, the illusion faded and he woke.
</p>
<p>
	He was in the middle of a bright white room, in a chair. Custos had been here. He rubbed his chin, where what passed as a beard, and what others might call face pubes, had grown. His hair was longer, but not in a cool way. He looked like a soccer mom who had just given up.
</p>
<p>
	He tapped the watch, but Ellie didn’t respond. She was furious at him, and who could blame her?
</p>
<p>
	With a purpose, he strode to the door, knowing exactly who he had to free first.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	“You see? I get a better swing if I pull from the hip.” Tamia said as she arced through the air with the photonic blade, carving the body of a Technomancer in twain and turning him into the humanoid equivalent of a banana split.
</p>
<p>
	“Surely you get more length if you swing from the shoulder?” Taber wove between two technomancers and skewered them with two spiky arms, making the most unappetising kebabs ever made.
</p>
<p>
	“Trust a guy to worry about length over effectiveness.” Tamia laughed, backflipping over a charging Technomancer and slicing it from legs to neck and creating the galaxy’s longest ass crack, which Grissom Graves immediately shot red hot laser bolts into as if he were trying to fuse it shut. “That one was already dead, Grissom, you can’t count it!”
</p>
<p>
	“He was still breathing!” Grissom growled. “Anyway, we killed them all. What was the score?”
</p>
<p>
	“Three way tie again.” Taber breathed heavily, exhausted. “Seems statistically impossible to have a three way tie 45 times in a row.”
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, this place is weird. Statistically, I should’ve gotten annoyed at you both and killed you by now.”
</p>
<p>
	“You could’ve tried.” Tamia laughed. “I’m oddly calm here though. Like I don’t need to fight.”
</p>
<p>
	“Only so many times you can cave in your arch enemy’s face in.” Taber shook his head.
</p>
<p>
	“Speak for yourself, Taber.” Grissom checked his pistols, made sure they had recharged. “I could kill a thousand of these toasters. But I see what you're saying, I could do with a rest right now.” He looked around, and found a tree to lean against. “This place reminds me of the last time I saw my brother, Emmeth. We were hunting Harvesters in a forest like this on the forest planet of Forest II and we were separated. A wave of Harvesters took him. I only found his guns as I fought my way through them. Weird, I never told anybody that. Guess I’m coming to terms with it finally.”
</p>
<p>
	Tamia sat, crossed legged. “It’s tough being alone, it takes time to process. When I found out the Blue Raven Salvagers were a front for my da…the Technomancer - it took meeting Hijoki and you guys for me to feel like I had family again.” She sniffed, and felt tears she probably should’ve cried months ago. She wiped her face delicately against her bulletproof tactical ninja assault suit. “Hijoki felt like that too, we were both lost, the last of our kind really.”
</p>
<p>
	Taber melted down to the floor, almost turning into a puddle. “I’m sorry guys. My whole clan of Darklings were massacred in the wild wars. We thought we were so clever -  being immortal meant we only had kids once in a millenia. And then we were hunted and killed by the Magisterium for being way too fucking metal. And then there was only me left. It’s hard being the last one, even when you’re a shapeshifting stud muffin like me.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom was feeling light headed. “I don’t know why, but I feel kinda euphoric here, like the problems don’t mean much anymore, like talking about them frees me from them.”
</p>
<p>
	“I know exactly what you mean. It doesn’t hurt so much here.” Tamia trailed off, staring at the wall. “Like it’s finally time to let go.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel burst into the room, and rushed to the computer console. As he tapped instructions in, Forex Santo stood in the room, igniting Hijoki with a lighter. Grissom’s brother Emmeth lay on the floor struggling as another Grissom strangled him. And high in the ‘sky’, a simulation of Hallie Swiftfeather screamed for Taber’s help as she fell to the Earth.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom, Hijoki and Taber snapped out of their delusions as if they were hit in the face with a long rubber dildo. They rushed to help the illusions, and Lionel instantly switched them off at the console. The three of them looked distraught, before turning to Lionel in utter rage.
</p>
<p>
	Taber slithered quickly over to Lionel and wrapped his throat in a tendril, lifting his other arm and turning it into an axe. “How dare you? You have no right!”
</p>
<p>
	“I had no choice.” Lionel fought for air. “For the last 45 days you’ve all been caught in a fantasy that would’ve killed you. I was too before Ellie saved me!”
</p>
<p>
	Taber let him go, but was still gritting his black teeth, shaking with fury. Lionel choked and spluttered. “I’m sorry. You needed a surprise to pull you out.” He locked eyes with Grissom, who looked at him with such intense hatred.
</p>
<p>
	“That wasn’t a pleasant surprise. Like when someone tries to accidentally poke you in the wrong hole and then you have to tear their dick clean off.” Tamia chuckled as everyone stared at her. “My heart is still pounding, Lionel.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom marched over to Lionel and dragged him to his feet, holding him by the collar. “You above all know how much that would’ve hurt me. How could you conjure that up?”
</p>
<p>
	“I didn’t!” Lionel slapped Grissom’s hand away. “I programmed the computer to read you all and show you your deepest fear or regret. You conjured it.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom couldn’t hold his gaze, the room suddenly silent. He pulled his guns from his holsters and marched out of the room. ‘Let’s just finish this, and get off this shithole of a station.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Heath and Ludwig worked furiously on the Swiftfeather from the lab. They had fixed the slip drive and the hull breaches, and had even planned a bitching hot tub that had those jets in the good places. Don’t look at me like that, you know what I’m talking about. They were now working on offensive systems, despite Ludwig joking that they had enough offence already with Blotch, Taber and Grissom. Ludwig couldn’t remember the last time he had enjoyed himself as much, and Heath was efficiently beavering away, deep in thought. Content.
</p>
<p>
	They had nearly completed their work hundreds of times already, but no sooner had they designed a new weapon, another idea had come to them and they had gone back to the drawing board. It was a cycle of design and innovation they were both loving.
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t know why we didn’t see it, but this won’t work, Heath.” Ludwig tutted, still smiling. “What made us think that bayonets on a ship would be effective?”
</p>
<p>
	“I do not know, but it is better than our previous idea of two giant screens on the side of the ship that displayed offensive language.” Heath shook his head. “How did we ever think that would help us against the…what was its name…the Techno…thing.”
</p>
<p>
	“The others, um, Mookie, and uh…those guys, might be able to give us a few ideas…do you think? Ludwig rubbed his head and thought of the crew, he couldn’t picture their faces.
</p>
<p>
	“I am compelled to just keep working Ludwig, I feel we will find the answers soon. Do you think if we covered the ship in Tec9s, that might help?” Heath placed a model of the ship on the table between them, and Ludwig became instantly fascinated with the concept.
</p>
<p>
	“What about if we developed some sort of machine that turned idiocy into energy blasts, we have enough of that to power a fleet’s worth of weapons.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh no.” Heath shook his head. “Idiocy-based weapons were banned after the Joe Rogan Podcast viewers nearly took over the galaxy in my universe. They were just too stupid to beat.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, you goddamn poindexters.” Grissom said as he burst through the doors with Taber at his heels. “You’re exactly where we left you.”
</p>
<p>
	Taber looked at the model on the table in disgust. “Have you just taped a couple of submachine guns to this model? How does this improve the ship in the hanger bay? Or is it this model you’ve been working on this whole time?”
</p>
<p>
	“I…that is…we were try to…” Ludwig scratched his head with his tentacles. “Heath?”
</p>
<p>
	Heath looked at the small model of the ship they had been working on for the 45 days. “I..I do not…”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh fuck this.” Grissom picked up the model and smashed it against the wall. Ludwig instantly felt the fog that had been clouding his brain lift.
</p>
<p>
	“We were working on a model!!” Ludwig shouted, incredulously.
</p>
<p>
	“I feel somewhat abashed by our lack of…well anything.” Heath said. “Custos. Would I be correct in assuming she had something to do with this?”
</p>
<p>
	Taber laughed. “Looks like she’s given us all what we wanted. Aggression, catharsis, for some reason model building. But now we’re free, we need to get outta here.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	The Wraith slithered into the room they had left Forex Santos in, a room of monitors where he stood in front of. Half the monitors showed scientific data regarding the heat death of the universe - projections, plans, calculations - the longest game one could play that wasn’t that fucking skipping game in Super Mario Odyssey. I mean, when are programmers going to learn that very few people actually enjoy those sorts of challenges. Pressing A 100 times in a row is not peak gameplay, Nintendo.
</p>
<p>
	The other half of the monitors were devoted to scanning the multiverse, watching his daughter, and her various counterparts in the multitude of universes she was present in.
</p>
<p>
	“Are you happy, Forex?” The Wraith whispered.
</p>
<p>
	The man smiled, removing his chrome skull domino mask to reveal tears were falling from his eyes. “The universe will die, and she will be happy, Is happy, in hundreds of universes. Yes, I couldn’t be more content.”
</p>
<p>
	“Almost seems a shame to free you from it.” The Wraith said. “But our missions seem incompatible, I’m afraid.”
</p>
<p>
	He slipped a pointed talon across Forex’s throat and watched the lifeblood pour from the man’s neck. Santo smiled as he died, his eyes still on the monitors. The Wraith absorbed his energy quickly, taking his body for their own.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Tamia opened the door to the ‘library’ such as it was. In reality it was a sterile white room that, when she entered, became an illusion of the library her friends were obsessed with. Doots stood in front of a bookcase, frantically fingering the spines of books for a hint of where she came from. She couldn’t see Hijoki, where was that cottonhead? Mookie sat in the corner watching prophesies on the tablets, rifling through them quickly, one where Blotch was a traffic guard, where Lionel was a Duke of Lead, or where Doots and Mookie were happily married, There was another where Tamia herself was had what looked like her own little crotch-goblins. They were so grotty and dribbly, with dead eyes that held no intelligence. Like cow eyes. And worse yet they were attached to her hand in the place where she expected to see Hijoki.
</p>
<p>
	No, she decided. No, this was unacceptable. She would kill everyone in this station before she would replace Hijoki with some horrible little snot-faced gremlin. She went up to Mookie and tore the tablet from their hands before cracking it over her knee. “Wake up Mooks.”
</p>
<p>
	As Mookie rubbed her large black eyes, Tamia moved onto Doots, and punched her clean in the face. “It doesn’t matter who you were, only who you are, Doots. Now is the only thing that matters.”
</p>
<p>
	Her two fellows looked dazed and annoyed. “Where the hell do you think you’re going?” Doots called.
</p>
<p>
	“To find my dad.” Taia said without thinking. She found Hijoki propped up in a device that let him turn the pages of a book with a command. He was sipping a martini through a straw and not noticing it was just leaking out the bottom of him.
</p>
<p>
	“Tamia?” He said as he noticed her, almost dreamily. “Why are you here?”
</p>
<p>
	“To get you out of here.”
</p>
<p>
	Hijoki looked horrified. “I can’t go yet, I haven’t learned how to keep you safe.”
</p>
<p>
	“How about we keep each other safe? She said, and held out her hand. Hioki took a deep breath and collapsed onto her palm. She pulled him onto her hand and kissed the top of his head. “You silly old fool.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	The Wraith walked into the room with the Android technomancer, on the brand new legs he had absorbed from his new host. The Android turned around instantly at their sudden appearance. “I know why you are here, wraith. I will not be so easy to kill.”
</p>
<p>
	The Wraith crackled and brought sharp tendrils of black from within his cape, growing and twisting like pulsing veins. “You like experiments, so let's test that theory.”
</p>

</p>
<p>
	Blotch and Bar’Thur stood on the bridge of a large ship. Over the past 45 days they had hunted dinosaurs in Jurassic park to extinction again, killed every oompa loompa in Wonka’s factory, and hunted down the shiny skankpires in the Twilight franchise. Now they were hunting a shark. Blotch wasn’t keen on the Water, but luckily she was a floatation device, so couldn’t sink if she fell overboard.
</p>
<p>
	“Huntin’s grand today lass. We’ll be eating shark butts in no time.” Bar’Thur stood on the front of the ship. What’s that bit called? Ah yes, the face of the ship. The wind battered him in the face, so he did the only thing Bar’Thur knew how to do - he unzipped his slacks and pissed straight into it.
</p>
<p>
	Blotch laughed until her jelly turned a bright pink. “Hopefully old toothy is attracted to the scent of frog piss, you gross old roadkill.”
</p>
<p>
	Just then the shark breached and tried to take a bite out of her friend, who dodged and pinned the fish to the deck with his giant battleaxe. Blotch left the wheel - wheel? Is that right? Look, I may have swabbed a few poopdecks in my time, but I’m not a fucking sailor alright, you want nautical accuracy, go catch some crabs - and then jumped down to the lower deck, smashing her cudgel over the sharks head and pushing it’s brains through it’s eyesocket. “Damn fine weapon. You sure you don’t want it back?” She asked.
</p>
<p>
	“Looks better on ya, kid.” Bar’Thur smiled.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s good to have you back, Frog. I was lost without you.” She said, wrapping her tubular arms around him. He returned the hug.
</p>
<p>
	“Good to be back, Blotchy.”
</p>
<p>
	He let his arm sag suddenly, and she pushed him away. “What is it?”
</p>
<p>
	Bar’Thur looked past her shoulder. “We got company. Who’s the boy?”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch ran to Lionel and hugged him. “Lionel! I’m so glad to see you buddy. This is my best friend, Bar’Thur.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel looked sad, sadder than she’d seen him. “I’m glad you got to see him one last time, Blotch. I really am.”
</p>
<p>
	She held Lionel at arms length, giving him a look that she hoped conveyed how stupid she thought he was. The kid was serious. “What are you jizz brained? Why would it be the last time? Bar’Thur can come with us.”
</p>
<p>
	“This isn’t real. It’s a fantasy, Blotch. We’re in a prison of our own making. You told me Bar’Thur was dead, killed by arrows in the back. You buried him, how can he be alive?”
</p>
<p>
	She pushed him away, shaking her headsack and trying to block him out, even if part of her, a small part, knew he was right. “No, I don’t believe it. I won’t. We’re together again, that’s all that matters.”
</p>
<p>
	“He’s not real, Blotch.” Lionel held a hand out to her, but she refused to take it.
</p>
<p>
	“Bin the kid off and let’s go hunt some more monsters.” Bar’Thur laughed as he pulled the axe out of Jaw’s head.
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t care, Lionel.” Blotch cried out. “I won’t let him go again.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel frowned. “Blotch, you either say goodbye now, or I turn the simulation off and take the chance away from you.”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch glared. “You wouldn’t.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel moved towards the door he had come from that was seemingly floating in mid air. “You’re my friend, I can’t let you live and die in a fantasy.”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch fell to her knees. “But I don’t want to live out there anymore. What sort of friend wouldn’t let me just die?”
</p>
<p>
	“The best kind. Now say goodbye.” He left through the door.
</p>
<p>
	Blotch turned to Bar’Thur. He narrowed his eyes. “You’re not coming, kid?”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch looked skyward, and took a deep breath. “The bigger part of me is. But I gotta say goodbye for a bit.”
</p>
<p>
	“Well, you know where ta find me Blotchy.” Bar’Thur offered his hand and Blotch took it. They did that homoerotic handshake/arm wrestle from Predator that no one seems to like when you point out that it’s super gay.
</p>
<p>
	“Yep, in between a skanktroll’s legs.” Blotch smiled sadly. “Computer, turn this horror show off.”
</p>
<p>
	Bar’Thur vanished, and Blotch let her arm fall.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	The crew stood in the hanger bay, waiting for Blotch. None of them could look at each other and stood in silence, feeling foolish, or betrayed, or raw against their revealed truths.
</p>
<p>
	As Blotch joined them, she marched straight up the ramp and onto the Swiftfeather, as Lionel reached forward. “Blotch…”
</p>
<p>
	“Say one more word Lionel, and I’ll kill you where you stand.” she said, stepping into the ship.
</p>
<p>
	Something burst into the bay, a writhing pulsing mass of wires and hate, the new form of the Technomancer. It was horrific, tendrils and wires and a human body with cybernetic enhancements. It was the three of them merged together, but with the Wraith holding the wheel. It took one look at Lionel, licked its lips, then laughed and propelled itself into its own ship. Within seconds, the ship was gone. In its place it left oily blood, and machinery parts.
</p>
<p>
	“Left to lick its wounds.” Custos appeared behind them, she was now a shining being of gold, not the old crone she had pretend to be. “Had a battle with its fellow and was badly hurt. Won’t stay that way for long though.”
</p>
<p>
	Tamia drew her sword. “We’re going, don’t try and put us into your weirdo fantasies again lady.”
</p>
<p>
	“Why go? I can give you whatever you want. I can put you back under if it’s truly what you want.” Custos pleaded, begging for them to stay.
</p>
<p>
	“We all want to leave.” Mookie said. “That’s all we desire right now.”
</p>
<p>
	The crew departed and left Custos behind, one last look from Lionel as the ship’s ramp closed and the ships burst away from the station, which instantly vanished again  with no living beings to fuel it.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel went straight to the cockpit to find everyone, but no one was talking, especially not to him. He turned on his heel, guilty about what he had done. As he left for his bunk, he passed Heath in the corridor.
</p>
<p>
	Heath called after him. “You saved us all Lionel, even if they can’t thank you for it yet.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel spun to face him, but he was furious, and snapped at Heath. “Why me though? Why did I have to be the crowbar that broke us all? Why couldn’t I accept the reality Custos had made for me?”
</p>
<p>
	Heath tilted his head, considering. “Those with depression and anxiety score higher in tests of realism. Intelligence shows distinct positive correlation with mental illness. It is an indication that when an organic mind starts to understand too much about the confines of its own reality, it seeks to destroy itself. In other words, your natural paranoia and dissatisfaction with perfection saved us.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel stared at Heath blankly, and without saying a word walked slowly to his bunk. “Goodnight, Ellie.” He said, but she didn’t respond, probably still mad at his fantasy. He slept, but it was not well.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Technomancer X - he hadn’t thought of a cool new name yet so the X would have to suffice for now - assumed humanoid form and sat in the captain’s chair, then plugged a tendril into a slot on the panel, he took it out and turned it over, it wouldn't go in even though he could change his own form. He turned it back over one last time. “Damn USBs." he muttered.
</p>
<p>
	When he finally managed it, Ellie appeared on his screen. “Ok, you have me now, I paid your damn price and came with you. What do you want from me?”
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
