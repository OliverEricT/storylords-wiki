	Prompts - Chases and Hermits
</p>
<p>
	Lionel hung upside down in the cell, his feet encased in some crystalline substance. He didn’t know if it was the blood rushing to his head or the fact that the cell itself was lit by a pinkish-purple hue from the organic crystal walls, but the room looked b-eautiful. Although knowing that the Kessians secreted the crystals from their butts made it the beautiful you could look at, but didn’t want to touch, smell, or have near you in any way.
</p>
<p>
	“I suppose you’re wondering how I got in this mess…” He said aloud.
</p>
<p>
	“No, I was right next to ya. We were having a casual discussion about sheltering from the Harvesters and getting a bead on the Technomancer, and then you said something and they arrested us without trial and sent us here.” Grissom said as he hung next to his friend. ‘Friend’? Was that fair? Lionel would say that since Grissom had only threatened to garotte him with his own intestines twice today, that they were still friends.
</p>
<p>
	“Grissom, I’m recording a log.” Lionel sighed. “Cancel log.”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s a log alright.” Grissom growled, letting the silence hang in between them for a full thirty seconds before explaining. “I meant that what you were saying there was pure horseshi…”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh god, I wish I’d never taught you euphemisms.” Lionel muttered.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom stroked his chin. “You must have some idea what the Kressians said, you mentioned that English and Kressik were vaguely similar. Not surprising given that you’re both primitives with no sense of self preservation or morals. Though about as statistically impossible as an honest cop that the languages would be in any way alike.”
</p>
<p>
	“You’ve been so grumpy since we left Kalandra and her casino. With you giving those sledgehammer-subtle appraisals, you wonder why they threw us in here?”
</p>
<p>
	“Yes, that’s why I asked. I was curious.” Grissom nodded.
</p>
<p>
	“Well if we’re hanging around here for a while,” He snorted with laughter, but stopped when Grissom shot him the ‘I could snap you in half and use you as a toothpick’ stare. “...then maybe you could tell me about your brother like you promised to, maybe free up some of that pent up murderous rage. Either that or I know some great songs from my boy-scout days?”
</p>
<p>
	“Hmmm. My darkest fear and pain made manifest, or telling you about my brother.” Grissom rubbed his chin. “OK.”
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	It was peaceful on the peak of Praetus Tor, the hilltop ring of obsidian stone reserved for settling old differences. In fact it was so peaceful, you might have thought this was some picturesque, relaxing Eden for long walks, life-transforming vistas, and birds and bees going buck-wild with each other - did they do it together, Grissom wondered? No one had ever really finished that chat with him since his dad had left - but this place was blood-soaked, violent, and the only thing the birds and bees were doing was slaughtering each other.
</p>
<p>
	Many people were gathered here, the leaders of all the clans of the Dukes of Lead - the peacekeeping force of the seven sectors- including Grissom’s mother, Queen Mestral Graves and her advisors, including her robotic analyst BD800.  Also present were the antagonistic Duke Sesta - the cousin of the Queen who had been gunning for the throne for a decade now - and the Queen’s warlord, General Muffin - who wasn’t as cute as his name suggested. Also there was a stray cat there, generally getting in the way and not giving a fuck, pawing at the Queen’s long green cloak. At the back of the Coterie, amongst the villagers who had come, stood an old hermit, clutching a small, metallic object.
</p>
<p>
	But they were outside the ring of stones, and Grissom Graves - fifteen, virile, and mad as hell - had things to consider inside the ring. They had chased Jaxson Swiftfingers down to this place and now they would all try to bring the Quartermaster down. Catching Grissom in his thoughts, Jaxon threw a punch that was easily dodged by the young Graves, who slid on his knees Pete Townsend style and grabbed at his opponent's achilles. Jaxson was too fast though, and brought an elbow to the back of Grissom’s head.
</p>
<p>
	“Brainless.” Jaxson growled.
</p>
<p>
	Kalandra yelled in anger at Grissom’s defeat and used his doubled over body as a stepping stone, jumpkicking at Jaxson, who caught her ankle and flung her at the nearest rock pillar, driving the air from her lungs.
</p>
<p>
	“Emotional.”
</p>
<p>
	Fincher and Ondar attacked as one, punches and kicks flying as if a choreographed dance, mainly because they’d practised it so much - that and the Cotteneye Joe dance. Jaxson took a step back and careened them into each other, butting their heads and near knocking them out.
</p>
<p>
	“Obvious.”
</p>
<p>
	Danarius was next, but she hesitated in her approach, letting Jaxon advance on her and putting her on the defensive. She threw a few off-balance punches, and he turned her weak attack into a hammerlock, then chucked to the floor.
</p>
<p>
	“Sloppy.”
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth was the only one standing now, and he stood wringing his hands. “I don’t suppose I could subdue you with some well rehearsed facts about bugs?”
</p>
<p>
	“And the worst of all - Foolish.” Jaxson advanced on Emmeth, who edged backwards.
</p>
<p>
	“I also can show you some pretty average close up magic?” Emmeth offered. As Jaxon got close, Emmeth stood a little straighter. “Or… I can keep rambling for a bit, hoping that my friends will have recovered enough to surround you and give you a beating?”
</p>
<p>
	Jaxon raised an eyebrow and turned, only to be roundhoused straight in the jaw by Kalandra.  Ondar and Fincher kicked the back of his knees in synch, driving him to the floor, as Danarius just straight up kicked him in the balls with a force that produced a scream from Jaxson that sounded like when cats have frogs in their mouths…if you know, then you know, it haunts your dreams, man. Grissom gave the final touch, with a meaty hambone to the chin that sent his head back and his soul straight to the fucking phantom zone.
</p>
<p>
	As Jaxon crumpled to the floor, any outside observer would assume that the assembly would have cheered or clapped. Instead, General Muffin strode towards the ring of stones and wiped one of the runes from the top, removing the forcefield that kept the group imprisoned for their final assessment, then went to rouse Jaxson with some smelling salts.
</p>
<p>
	“It is a new record, Your Majesty.” BD800 announced. “The group managed to subdue the quartermaster in four minutes and fifty…”
</p>
<p>
	“Not so, Beedee.” Queen Mestral Graves said sternly. “The trial requires all members of the cadre attack as one. Emmeth did not attack at all.”
</p>
<p>
	As Emmeth shrank in shame, Grissom stepped forward and put a hand on his shoulder. “He is as valuable a part of this squad as I am, Mother. As much a Duke of Lead as anyone here. Except maybe Sherrie the Stupid, the village idiot, who thinks she’s a sheep.”
</p>
<p>
	“Baaaa!” Said Sherrie from the crowd, doffing a sheep skull she wore as a hat.
</p>
<p>
	“I wonder, would you say that if he were not your own brother?” The Queen raised an eyebrow, prompting the whole entourage gathered to fall silent. Grissom felt a rage that threatened to bubble over, enhanced by the normal rage of a blue-balled 15 year old boy. Instead, Grissom turned and stormed away out of the circle, leaving the elders to whisper about the embarrassment they had just witnessed.
</p>
<p>
	Jaxson Swiftfingers watched as the children followed Grissom down from the Tor and into the surrounding forest, all sending daggers of hatred back at their elders. “That was a mistake, my Queen. Those children are the best trainees I’ve seen in fifteen years as a teacher. It’s even more important we have them out in the field with our losses...”
</p>
<p>
	The Queen held a hand up and lent in to whisper. “The decision is mine, Jaxson. Just because you share my bed doesn’t mean you are my equal.” With that she turned, and rode away on her warhorse - which was the name she gave her sweet jetbike hog- the rest of the dukes revving up and following her back to Graves Duchy for an evening of drinking and song.
</p>
<p>
	Beedee was about to transform and follow them, when Jaxson put a hand to his chest. “Beedee. She’s wrong, those kids are our best hope for the continuation of the Dukes.”
</p>
<p>
	“I agree, Sir Jaxson. But the Queen makes the rules. I will try and offer my wise council as always, which may mean buffing a few more bulletholes out of my chassis.”
</p>
<p>
	Jaxson smiled as the robot zipped away, his wheels squeaking as he rolled down the hill. He had been against the inclusion of the robot to the Queens’ inner circle, but now he was the closest ally he had. For a second, Jaxson thought he heard a cackling behind him, but when he turned, there was nobody on the Tor but him.
</p>
<p>
	*******
</p>
<p>
	Grissom punched a tree, and damn near broke a knuckle. Tears came to his eyes, but he blinked them away, he wasn’t going to let that witch’s words make a pansy outta him - it wasn’t as if his favourite band had broken up, or his mother had washed his favourite black t-shirt with skulls on it and made it shrink - nothing so disastrous as that. He just had to convince her they were ready.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s not fair.” Kalandra sat at the campfire and poked it with a stick.
</p>
<p>
	Ondar and Fincher nodded in unison, silent as always. They were as angry as Grissom had ever seen them, and he had been around that time someone had suggested the twins were practising kissing with each other - they had responded by nailing the boys tongue to the school desk. Danarius hadn’t said much for a long time, but turned to Emmeth and shook her head. “Don’t even think about blaming yourself. We need viable solutions, not a martyr.”
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth laughed, breaking the silence in the clearing. “I told you from the start I wasn’t cut out to be a Duke. The only class I was ever good at was Cunning and that one with the food.”
</p>
<p>
	“Lunch isn’t a class, backbirth.” Grissom smiled. “You had the smarts needed to develop a strategy to take down Swifty. You know Mother told him to go harder on us, fucker damn near broke my neck with that elbow. You’re a better Duke than any of us.”
</p>
<p>
	“He’s not better than me.” Kalandra smirked. “I’m amazing.” She walked over and kissed Grissom. They’d been together for about five weeks now, a summer love that was still in its infancy.
</p>
<p>
	Danarius sighed, sick of the display. “So what are we going to do, we need to prove ourselves if they’re going to cut the apron strings.”
</p>
<p>
	“Then maybe you need to prove yourself, kiddies!”
</p>
<p>
	The voice was nearer than it had any right to be, and as they all spun around to find the Hermit sitting by their fire, they wondered how he had crept under their defences. Though considering Grissom could see through his gossamer thin robe at his bony, nude, old man bod, he could’ve slid in pretty easily.
</p>
<p>
	“Allow me to introduce myself.” The Hermit said.
</p>
<p>
	“No.” Grissom growled. Get out of here now or I’ll kick you in your Old Spice scented, low hanging plums.”
</p>
<p>
	The old geezer held a metal orb in his hands and rolled it around between his palms. Emmeth stepped closer, eyeing the orb intently. “You. You were watching us at the Tor.”
</p>
<p>
	“Watching you fail I was, young’uns. But I have a way you could convince the wrinklies that you’re of true value.”
</p>
<p>
	“No more talk of wrinklies, old timer, that view is turning my stomach.” Danarius retched.
</p>
<p>
	But Grissom was intrigued, indeed most of them were, their eyes burning in anticipation. “What do you mean, old man?”
</p>
<p>
	“You’ve heard about the problems in the border villages recently, I’ll wager?”
</p>
<p>
	They had. Miles from the Duchies, small fishing and farm villages had been burned to the ground and the villagers had vanished. No bodies, no signs of abduction, no burial mounds, no remains. They’d just gone, Emmeth had hopefully suggested they’d all just migrated for the winter, but Kalandra had reminded him the villagers weren’t birds, and that it was the height of summer.
</p>
<p>
	“Well,” the hermit sucked at his toothless gums, and Danarius retched again. “I know where the bastards who did this are holed up.”
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	Jaxson burst into the great hall to find the senior council of the Dukes of Lead already in session. Though they were waiting for him, he went straight to the replication unit and ordered himself a mead. He felt the eyes of some of the Duchy heads burning holes in his back, but he took his time, and a long gulp, before he turned and took his place at the table.
</p>
<p>
	“Now we’re all here…” Duke Sesta glared at Jaxson before taking his stetson and gunbelt off and placing them next to him. “Our guns fall silent.”  He said.
</p>
<p>
	The others followed suit, it was customary to wait until every Duchy was represented at the table before formality was dropped. “Let reason ring loud.” The coterie finished in unison.
</p>
<p>
	“What the hell was that, Mestral?” Sesta turned to his cousin. “Those kids deserve their place in the sect, we’re losing Dukes across the sectors, and we need replacements.”
</p>
<p>
	General Muffin fiddled with his wax moustache and nodded his head. “I must agree. The trainees took Jaxson down in record time, and Emmeth is a master strategist. Wouldn’t you agree, BeeDee?”
</p>
<p>
	The Droid clearly looked uncomfortable to be put on the spot “Technically…there was no concrete reason to fail that intake, the stats favour…” The table erupted into murmurs, the Dukes knew that three dissenting voices at the council, including the Queen’s chief advisor and head of her military, was tantamount to a rebellion.
</p>
<p>
	The Queen slammed her hand down on the table to cut through the chat. When the circle fell silent, she took in all of them in one long look. “The problem is not Emmeth, or the way they passed that test. They passed. But I will not feed our children to a meat grinder. They have attacked the shipyards at Krevan Dey, the grain stores at the Red Veil, the Lissan Colonies. They surround us on all sides, with no trace left and no bodies taken. There is evil rising, and we do not know why or where from. Be it rivals long thought dead, cannibalistic aliens, or clowns. We have no idea what is happening.”
</p>
<p>
	“Nor do we have the reach to find out, Mestral.” Jaxson said heavily. At the Council table, all were equal, there were no gods or masters. As legends said, the Dukes of Lead did kill their gods because they were unjust, and the Dukes valued justice over all. “Better they die with a gun in their hand, than live on their hands and knees, surely?”
</p>
<p>
	“You have that so wrong, Jaxson. Better that they live with a gun in their hand than die on their hands and knees.” And there it was, the Queen’s admission clear as day - she wondered if the Dukes of Lead could survive this.
</p>
<p>
	“So this is a war council, then?” Duke Freyus asked. The idea held little desire for any of them, they were peacekeepers, not warmongers. They helped the neighbouring systems settle disputes and fight injustice. They did not go to war.
</p>
<p>
	“If someone is targeting us, we don’t have a choice do we?” Duke Severin asked, almost to no one, not really wanting an answer.
</p>
<p>
	Jaxson broke the silence. “So we vote. Draw in and close our borders, prepare for war. Or we continue to fill the ranks and fight as we encounter these rogues.” He glanced at Mestral, his Queen, his lover, and saw the utter betrayal in her eyes. She obviously hoped for more time. But there was none left.
</p>
<p>
	“I will abstain.” She declared. “This vote needs to be of the people.”
</p>
<p>
	“To go to war, then.” General Muffin asked. Of the forty seven in attendance, only fourteen held their hands down, including BeeDee and the Queen.
</p>
<p>
	“To continue as we have?” Ten, including BeeDee, placed their hands skyward. It was an objectionable choice, with no clear answer, and the winners felt as hollow as the losers.
</p>
<p>
	“We should adjourn, and come back to this chamber with clearer heads and keener minds.” The Queen declared. As the Dukes left the table and headed to their quarters, Jaxson lingered, and went to grab for the Queen’s hand. She pulled away.
</p>
<p>
	“Not tonight Jaxson, I need my own council right now.”
</p>
<p>
	He watched her leave, then went to say goodnight to BeeDee. He wouldn’t sleep this night, having been kicked out of his bedroom. “Goodnight BeeDee. A hard day tomorrow.”
</p>
<p>
	“A hard night before that, sir.” BeeDee watched as Jaxson nodded then left, then placed a small metallic orb on the circular table.
</p>
<p>
	********************
</p>
<p>
	The Hermit had been clear in his directions. Over the hills of despair, down through the valley of sorrow, past the desolate rivers and through the swap of that feeling when you hit your little toe on the leg of your bed. It had been a hard evening’s trek, one of difficult terrain by already tired kids.  To their credit, not one complained, moaned, or held them up, so keen were they to prove themselves a second time.
</p>
<p>
	But now they were here. The camp was marked by a faint mechanical buzzing that seemed to bother all six of them.
</p>
<p>
	“What the hell is that?” Kaladra whispered to Emmeth, hoping the nerd would be able to recognise it and maybe stop her migraine.
</p>
<p>
	“I naturally thought it was that quote unquote massager you brought to a survival retreat.” Emmeth winked.
</p>
<p>
	“Hey, girls have needs!”
</p>
<p>
	“Quiet!” Grissom hissed, and pointed to a ridge that overlooked the camp below. The twins made their way up in double time, whilst Danarius and Kalandra were directed down and around the camp to attack from the East. Emmeth and Grissom would take them head on - well Grissom would and Emmeth would scream like a child as he carried him there.
</p>
<p>
	There were only five of them, but Grissom had never seen such fully functional machine/humanoid hybrids. They were fast as they packed bedrolls and cleaned camp, far more alive than machine.
</p>
<p>
	“True cyborgs.” Emmeth whispered, oddly impressed.
</p>
<p>
	“Creepy, right?” Grissom nudged him with an elbow.
</p>
<p>
	“Only to you, brother. I find this all so fascinating.”
</p>
<p>
	Seeing the excitement in Emmeth’s eyes, Grissom brought him back. “Well, zip your fly back up kid, we’re going to kill those things.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’ve got my head straight, don’t you…” Emmeth stopped.
</p>
<p>
	The frequency of the noise changed, and Emmeth held a hand up, keeping all three groups in place. He turned swiftly, his head darting around like a bird, until he found…there. In the branches above them, another of those metal orbs. He reached up and grabbed it, heard the faint buzzing. As he passed it to Grissom, the others joined them.
</p>
<p>
	“What are you doing, breaking position?” Grissom hissed, hunkering down, but when they didn’t follow suit, he turned to the cyborgs and noticed something odd. He waved a hand in front of the orb. Down in the valley, a hand shaped blur appeared where the cyborgs were working.
</p>
<p>
	“A hologram?” Danarius whispered, the disgust clear. “That dangly balled-old fuck tricked us.”
</p>
<p>
	“He had one of those things too. Probably a Hologram himself. But why? What reason would anyone have to bring a bunch of trainees out here?” Kalandra shook her head.
</p>
<p>
	“A bunch of trainees who aren’t getting drunk right now and who are on their guard.” Emmeth held his hand out and Grissom went to throw him the orb but stopped, the pitch of the device had changed again. “You hear that?”
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth grabbed the orb and threw it into the forest just before it exploded.
</p>
<p>
	***************
</p>
<p>
	The Duchy was incredibly peaceful, and Jaxson walked the halls wondering if it would ever be this quiet again. The vote to go to war was only four hours ago and everyone was sleeping, but he could already feel a change in the atmosphere. A heavy air hung over the whole estate, so dense it felt as if it was clogging his lungs and choking him.
</p>
<p>
	The Dukes of Lead had not been at war since settling the Border Wars between the Ro’kan and the Silanan nearly five millennia ago, where the two sides had argued over territory even though you can literally go up or down and stay out of each other's way forever in space. It was stupid, and bloody, and totally unnecessary. Like every war ever fought for every reason. But the Dukes of Lead had been forced to intervene after several colonies and four deep space Burger Kings along neutral routes had been destroyed in the fighting.
</p>
<p>
	The thought of war was making him feel morose, so he decided to go talk to Mestral, whether she wanted to or not. Who knew when they might be able to share a quiet moment over the next few years. He climbed the stairs and walked towards the master suite in the Duchy, only to see BeeDee running from the Queen’s chambers.
</p>
<p>
	“BeeDee?”
</p>
<p>
	Then there was heat, and a force that blew Jaxson back down the stairs, and then black.
</p>
<p>
	*******
</p>
<p>
	By the time they had hiked back to their home, the explosion had left almost nothing but smouldering wreckage. What was left of the Duchy was still aflame and burning, half the western wall caved in, the civilian settlement below completely destroyed. The places they had played, the people they had known, the very lives they had lived, all ash and flame. Emmeth grabbed Grissom’s arm, his nails digging into his brother’s flesh. When he spoke it was as if he were a child again. “Grissom?”
</p>
<p>
	Kalandra dropped to her knees as Danarius sobbed into her hands. Fincher and Ondar embraced, not knowing what to do. Grissom broke a limb from a tree and wielded it like a club. He pulled Emmeth to his feet and gestured to the Duchy. “Let’s go be Dukes.”
</p>
<p>
	“No. Not today.” Jaxson Swiftfingers whispered as he emerged from the brush, covered in ash and missing an eye. His poncho was blood soaked, and he favoured one leg as he approached them, carrying a bag that he threw down at their feet with a metallic clunk.
</p>
<p>
	“What are these?” Kalandra ran to embrace Jaxson, along with the twins. Grissom looked at Jaxson, and Emmeth could tell by the look they shared that the seven of them were the last Dukes of Lead left.
</p>
<p>
	“They’re our graduation guns.” Grissom growled, angrier than Emmeth had ever seen his brother.
</p>
<p>
	“And now we have to go, before he arrives.” Jaxson opened the bag and passed them each a pair of weapons emblazoned with their families coats of arms. Families that no longer existed.
</p>
<p>
	“Who?” Emmeth asked, but the conversation was over.
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	It was a five-day hike to the stashed ship Jaxson had hidden, just in case he had to leave. Grissom admired him for that, always having an escape plan. It was something he would implement in his life, especially if he had a terrible husband one day he might have to burn. Jaxson rushed them inside the ship, and began takeoff prep. They were going to head to the rim, where Jaxson could finish their training.
</p>
<p>
	The rest of his friends were strapped in, and Grissom found himself staring out the front window at the flame-reddened sky as Jaxson came back to the cockpit. He hadn’t been able to take a last look out the back at the place his family had called home for the past thirty six generations, the burden of being the last generation far too heavy.
</p>
<p>
	“If you don’t go take one last look, to say goodbye, you’ll regret it.” Jaxson said, his face white, and Grissom felt he had just done the same.
</p>
<p>
	Leaving the cockpit and passing his friends, none of whom met his eye as he did, Grissom went down the loading ramp and looked past the forest borders at the remains of his home. There was nothing to say goodbye to, but he said a silent goodbye and closed his eyes. When he opened them, BeeDee stood at the Treeline, but it wasn’t BeeDee anymore. He wore his mother’s long cloak, smoke stained and tattered, with a chainmail, horned helm. He was terrifying, a facade that Grissom knew would haunt him for the rest of his life. But those next to him were the ones that truly hardened his heart. Part cybernetic, part dead, were the reanimated Dukes of Lead, including General Muffin, and his mother, the Queen. The thing once posing as BeeDee grinned,a metal smirk that stabbed Grissom in the heart and nearly drowned him in sorrow.
</p>
<p>
	He closed his eyes quickly, the childlike fear of infancy enveloping him, fully expecting to be swarmed then and there. But when he opened them, the demons at the treeline were gone. He went back to Jaxson in small steps, his face pale.
</p>
<p>
	Jaxson flipped a switch and the ship shuddered upwards. “Were they still there?”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom turned to his Quartermaster, his mouth agape in shock.
</p>
<p>
	“Good.” Jaxon whispered, his face equally as pale. “Now you all know the face of our enemy. Don’t forget it.”
</p>
<p>
	The ship took off, leaving the horrors of the last few days and the genocide of their entire race behind them.
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	“So, that’s how you saved Christmas?” Lionel said with a woozy smile as he hung upside down from the ceiling of the cell.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom gave him the old side eye. “What the hell’re you talking about, boy?”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel giggled. “I’m sorry, the blood is going straight to my head.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom tried to swing a fist at him but couldn’t reach. “How are we going to get out of this?”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh.” Lionel hit himself in the head. “Zemeldis.”
</p>
<p>
	The crystal cuffs around their feet dissolved instantly, sending the pair crashing to the floor. Grissom licked his teeth and picked up his hat, pulling Lionel to his feet as he rose. “How the hell did you do that?”
</p>
<p>
	“Ok, don’t get mad.” Lionel said as he held out two hands.
</p>
<p>
	“I warn you, I once killed a man for taking my seat at the movies. I hadn’t sat in it yet, I’d just decided it was mine.”
</p>
<p>
	“So, I was getting pissed with you being a grumpy gustopher all the time, so I asked them to lock us up to give you a chance to tell me what was wrong.” Lionel said.
</p>
<p>
	“That’s a brave move for someone with the muscle profile of a chicken carcass.” Grissom pulled his gun from his pocket and shot Lionel in the leg. Lionel’s scream echoed through the prison corridors.
</p>
<p>
	“You shot me!” Lionel screamed as Grissom supported his diminutive friend with an arm.
</p>
<p>
	“Now we’re even. Let’s go and put you in the medical regenerator.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel shot him a look. “We have a regenerator?! Why didn’t we use it when I had that nebula 7 plague and nearly shit myself to death?”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom shrugged. “Didn’t wanna spoil you.”
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly, Lionel stopped. “Wait, you didn’t tell me about how your brother died at all. Does that mean we have another Grissom Graves flashback story in our future?”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel pushed him on, the door to the prison cell closing slowly behind them. “What do we say about stories, Lionel? Only if the right prompts come up.”
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
