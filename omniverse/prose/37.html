	Prompts: Axes and Blacksmiths
</p>
<p>
	By Rich Masters
</p>
<p>
	Boom. Boom.
</p>
<p>
	The war drums pounded as the motorboat-ercade of tricked out hovercrafts with go-faster stripes (which were cool), and roboswastikas (decidedly uncool) chased the small, battered starship struggling to get airborne. The pursuit cut a swathe across the marshy boglands that covered what was once New Jersey, the one place the nuclear wasteland had actually made somewhat better. The motorboat-ercade was crewed by cyborg killers, a twisted, gross, slimy combination of mutant and machine, kind of like when your mum uses that sex toy you found as a teenager. You may scoff, but the biggest group affected by STIs are in the 70-80 bracket, just some food for thought. Anyhoo, in this far flung New Jersey of the future, the only mutant slack-jawed, dead eyed freaks were the ones in the Jersey Shore motorboat gangs, rather than in your average 7/11 or TJ Maxx or in the general New Jersey public.
</p>
<p>
	Interesting Masters Anecdote of The Week™, it’s called TK Maxx over here. It’s equally filled with numb brained idiots, but I wonder why they changed it, not hard enough to google it obviously. 
</p>
<p>
	Boom. Boom. The drums sounded closer as the motorboat-ercade was almost within firing distance. The hovercraft were heavily armoured with bolted together sheet metal and spikes poking out of the sides like some sort of S&M pleasure cruise. Plooms of black smoke billowed from the hovercraft as they pushed themselves harder and harder to catch the small vessel, which was somehow dodging ever laser blast on its way to Port Jersey, where weirdly the mutant dockworkers communicated solely in wolf whistles and misogynistic or racist chatter, even though they no longer knew the significance - they just carried on as they had always done in life.
</p>
<p>
	The small ship banked late around a large rock which the lead motorboat smashed into, detonating into a large fireball. Luckily, the cyborg piloting it flew through the air and activated his parachute to float gently downwards. Unluckily, seeing this, the escaping ship pirouetted 180 degrees, and a muscled arm leaned out the rolled down pilot-side window and pumped the Jersey Shore Bot full of hot plasma. As it peeled back away, the nameplate of the ship came clearly into view of the story camera…and it said…wait for it…drumroll please…The Conveyance of Grissom Graves 9. HOW’S THAT FOR A FUCKING START TO A STORY?
</p>
<p>
	“They’re almost on you!” Lionel Ritchie’s raspy voice came from subspace radio, Grissom doubted it was because of the signal and probably because he just was panicking like a little bitch. He looked over to the seat next to him where something the size of a shovel sat, the item swaddled in tight wrappings to keep it safe. “That’s precious cargo there, buddy. Make sure it stays safe, not like that Diplomat from Anecdotus 4.”
</p>
<p>
	“For the last time, you didn’t specify he needed to arrive at the peace talks alive, Lionel.” Grissom Graves growled as he vented some engine fuel and then ignited it with a laser to create a wall of fire that incinerated another hovercraft that went up with a Wilhelm Scream. “Plus it did mean we had a ridiculous Weekend at Bernie’s style caper that would have probably been funnier as a whole episode.”
</p>
<p>
	“Alright, we both learned that weekend that I have to be very specific in my instructions.” Lionel muttered. “Kinda like that time I asked you to watch my back and you stared at me while that Aurelliax bounty hunter stabbed me in the kidney.”
</p>
<p>
	“And that memory still keeps me warm on cold nights, Lionel.” Grissom dipped a wing into the shallow water to toss some mud and weed into another ship's engine, making it immediately explode.
</p>
<p>
	“But Griss, the cargo can’t fall into the Harvesters’ hands…or if that’s General Clamphands chasing you, his weird hydraulic press things.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom looked to the Port on the horizon. He wasn’t going to make it in one piece. “You’re right, the New Jersey Pincher can’t grab hold of this axe. We gotta prioritise cargo over crew here, kid.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom could hear the reluctance in Lionel’s pause before he sighed. “There’s gotta be another way, Grissom.”
</p>
<p>
	“There’s no time, brother.” Grissom stated, before switching the hyperdrive on for an instant, slamming the Conveyance of Grissom Graves 14 into the open starport docking port and blowing the ship into a huge fireball of death.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	“What do you mean ‘mandatory ship inspection’?” Asher said, balancing a small dagger on her finger at the departure window to be menacing. “We just won this ship fair and square two days ago in your terrible Jersey casino and depression house, why would it need inspection?”
</p>
<p>
	“Well you won this ship off a drug lord, and it had been used for a number of illicit murder related activities.” The mutant port worker said, not intimidated by Asher’s aggression as he pushed an eyeball back into his socket. “I would have thought a crew of clearly on the level individuals such as yourself…” He looked at Hallgrim picking something from his teeth, Oryx trying desperately to hide his crocodile snout with an upside down newspaper and HUM13 reading his ‘How to Count Cards and Cheat Drug Lords for Robots: a Beginners Guide’ book and rolled his eyes. “...would want to comply with a port inspector before they got off planet to avoid the murderous cartel leader they legitimately won this vessel from?” He tapped his clipboard with a pen.
</p>
<p>
	“So, what are we up to?” Kellan said as she and Florgo rejoined the group. They had been spending a lot of time together recently, and Asher was watching that.
</p>
<p>
	“Nice of you to join us.” Oryx muttered with a smirk.
</p>
<p>
	“We needed some new clothes, I was looking pretty conspicuous in my Veil attire.” Florgo said. Putting out the arms of his new black cloak.
</p>
<p>
	“Perfect. Dark mage in an inconspicuous dark cloak with red rune trim.” Oryx laughed. “Maybe next a sign that says, ‘magician for hire’, or Maybe you could carry a rabbit around.”
</p>
<p>
	“Actually, I bought the rabbit.” Kellan smiled. “Battery pack was worn out on the last one.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim pulled the inspector to one side, then apologised as he disconnected the man’s rotting arm from his shoulder. “Listen pal, one inspector to another - you inspect ships and I’ve inspected a fair few dump trucks and wagons in my time,” he winked at the inspector. “Is there any way we could speed up the process?”
</p>
<p>
	“Are you offering to bribe me?” The inspector squinted, half because he was annoyed and half to keep his puss filled eye from falling out.
</p>
<p>
	“Well I wasn’t looking to give you a reach around.” Hallgrim smirked. “Unless that’s what would get us off planet quicker, because lemme tell you, I saw a mutant 70 yr-old woman pushing a cart outside a walmart in pyjamas with a thong sticking out the top, so I’m worried if I stay here much longer my dick just might tear itself off my body and set itself on fire.”
</p>
<p>
	The inspector thought for a second, rubbing his chin down to the bone and surveying the crew. Asher was digging under her nails with her knife, whilst the teen he thought he heard one of them call Kellan, just stared at him suspiciously. “Alright. I have some contraband I need to get off world and to the Graydon Nebula to a ship waiting there. If you could take it, no questions asked, I’ll waive the inspection and get you on your way before Billy the Hat catches up to you.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim mulled it over, running his tongue along his teeth. He knew there wasn't one among them who would sign this off, bunch of do-gooders that they were. It was down to him again, to make the hard decision so that they could get on with doing whatever they had spent the last half a year doing. 
</p>
<p>
	“Alright, done.” Hallgrim offered a hand that the inspector hurriedly took.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	After he turned the hyperlight engines on, Hallgrim returned to the messhall of the ship and sat back in his chair and smirked. The accusing eyes of the entire crew were on him. “Look, I know you all wanna know how superhero Hallgrim saved the day. I just said to the inspector, ‘mate, if you don’t let us go, I’m going to shove your nose so far down your throat you’ll be able to smell your own taint’, and then he said…”
</p>
<p>
	HUM13 hummed. “Elevated heart rate, high blood pressure, and elevated stress hormones. So this is how lies are detected.”
</p>
<p>
	The crew looked at him and Hallgrim shrugged. “Alright…w..ell I certainly didn’t reduce to bribing him.”
</p>
<p>
	HUM13 tilted his head. “And it increases cumulatively with each lie, Fascinating.”
</p>
<p>
	A thin line of perspiration ran down Hallgrim’s temple. “I mean…I certainly didn’t offer a sexual favour or anything.”
</p>
<p>
	The crew turned to HUM13, who shook his head. They turned back to Hallgrim.
</p>
<p>
	“And even if I did, I certainly wouldn’t have enjoyed it.” Hallgrim crossed his arms over his head.
</p>
<p>
	“Warning! Warning!” HUM13’s internal sensors sounded before his head suddenly exploded, showering their accusing and unblinking stares at Hallgrim with shards of metal and sparks. “Excuse me please, I have a normal human headache and need some painkillers.” HUM13 said, before waddling off out the room, banging himself on the door frame in the process.
</p>
<p>
	“So what did you do?” Kellan asked as she pulled HUM13’s eye from her glass of water. “Please tell me it wasn’t anything dangerous.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim, raised his hands up. “Look Kells, I did accept some dodgy cargo, alright? But it shouldn’t create any issues or dangers for us, I wouldn’t put us in trouble like that.”
</p>
<p>
	Alarms sounded as the starship was rocked by sudden and immediate laser fire, and as she rushed back to the cockpit, Asher slapped Hallgrim around the back of the head. “Fucking idiot.” She hissed.
</p>
<p>
	Florgo joined her, and though he tried to sit in the pilot’s seat, as soon as butt touched leather, Asher shoved him to one side and took the seat. “We don’t need attack pattern bore-mega, you try and figure out what’s chasing us.” Asher said as she took the controls, pulling the ship out of hyperlight and immediately dodging another volley of laserfire.
</p>
<p>
	“I think we established in the last chapter that I’m a cool dark mage now!” Florgo said with a pout as he almost fell as the ship was rocked by more fire. “I can fire energy blasts, shadow walk, conjure up familiars…”
</p>
<p>
	“Alright, conjure me up some peace and quiet, Dumblebore.” Asher said, putting the ship into a hairpin rotation that she then pulled out faster than your dad wished he had to avoid producing such a monumental disappointment. 
</p>
<p>
	“In most instances I’d find being bullied by a mean woman quite intoxicating, but you’re just…” Florgo started.
</p>
<p>
	“You’re flirting with the wrong sister, magicboy.” Asher grimaced as the controls shook in her hand. “Check the readouts and see if you can figure out what sort of ship it is, I don’t want to bite the bullet to a cybertruck or something equally as useless.”
</p>
<p>
	Florgo pressed his face against the periscope type readout at the back of the cockpit, sorta like that thing Spock uses and we all pretend it’s not stupid because of how freaking cool it is. He pulled back, and his eyes had two circles of ink around them that made it look like spectacles. Asher was genuinely surprised that Hallgrim had resorted to a juvenile prank instead of straight up just jizzing on it or something equally as repugnant. Asher would have laughed at Florgo if not for the fear on his face.
</p>
<p>
	Asher rushed to the periscope and looked inside. The ship chasing them was huge, but that wasn’t what was frightening, it was cobbled together from cybernetic corpses, robotic zombies lashed together to make a hull. And its figurehead was the corpse of a green cloaked, lifeless Lich, with chrome horns and for some reason metallic nipples. And its nameplate read ‘HMS JK ROWLING’.
</p>
<p>
	Asher turned to Florgo, her eyes lined with black ink, her mouth a circle of horror (coincidentally what every man calls your mother’s private parts as they tell precautionary tales in their local bar). “We’re fucked.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Kellan, Oryx and Hallgrim headed for the cargo bay, trying not to slip on the metal gangway and break their necks as Asher steered the ship in an escape trajectory.
</p>
<p>
	“Crazy demon is going to kill us.” Hallgrim muttered.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan grabbed him by the collar and pushed him into the barrier, holding him over the side. “You better shut the hell up Hallgrim, you brought this on us, and I’m damned if you’re going to pin this on Asher. Keep it up and I’ll Rift what’s left of your brain straight up your arse.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim grinned at her. “Oh kid, buy me dinner first.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan roared with fury and pushed him over the barrier to send him tumbling 20 metres to the floor below. He crashed with a metallic thud, and Oryx stared at Kellan. She simply turned and walked down the stairs without so much as a look back. Oryx vaulted the barrier and landed on the metallic floor, pulling Hallgrim up as he unbroke his metallic neck and reset his shoulders into their sockets. 
</p>
<p>
	“Ah fun times, good thing she knew about my cybernetic joints, eh?” Hallgrim muttered.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx lifted an eyelid. “You’ve never even disclosed your metallic vertebrae to me, my friend. I think our little Kellan is becoming her future self before our very eyes.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan stood at the cargo crate, rubbing her chin as HUM13 waddled in from the crew quarters. He had only just managed to replicate the basic metal skeleton of his head, and for some reason had wrapped the top exposed wiring in a head towel, hair rollers stuck to his forehead.
</p>
<p>
	“I apologise for my appearance, I have not been able to apply my face yet.” HUM13 whispered.
</p>
<p>
	“That’s ok, Humie.” Kellan smiled. “I’ll help you get all dolled up later.”
</p>
<p>
	HUM13 put his unfinished head on his friend's shoulder, giving her a mild electric shock that she was good enough to ignore. “Thank you, friend Kellan.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx and Hallgrim joined the two of them, and Hallgrim stepped forward with a crowbar and thrust it into the crate before Oryx could protest. As he prised the top off, he muttered something about being made to look like a fool. The wooden lid splintered and fell to the floor, a bright light emanating from the box and filling the cargo bay, temporarily blinding all of them.
</p>
<p>
	“Hallgrim, if this crate is filled with Marcellus Wallace’s soul or some such stupidity, I’m going to kill you myself.” Oryx growled.
</p>

</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim blinked away the light and looked down into the crate. There, nestled up inside amongst straw, was a brute of a man dressed in cowboy attire, and a rainbow coloured keytar with an axe laid into the handle. “Anyone order a dead, gay pride, Garth Brooks?” Hallgrim said, just before an arm shot from the crate and grabbed him by the neck.
</p>
<p>
	“Lionel!?” The man yelled, disorientated as he rose from the box, keytar in one hand and Hallgrim’s throat in the other. “Mookie? Taber?”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx tried to stop his muscles tightening reflexively as he approached the man, trying to speak clearly, fearful that this might turn ugly fast. Although given that the cowboy looked like hammered shit and was covered in scars, it was plenty ugly already. “Sir? If you would please release our compatriot, we will help you find whom or whatever it is you are searching for.”
</p>
<p>
	The cowboy looked down at his hand to find a cyborg there, then turned to see a robot, a mutant and a teenager. It was like someone had looked into the deep recesses of Grissom Graves’ mind and found all the things he despised most as a younger man. And they’d put them in the ascending order too.
</p>
<p>
	“I swear if you Technomancer following freaks don’t let me off this boat, I’m going to skin y’all alive and make me a whole new winter wardrobe.” The man growled as he tried to shake off the hibernation sickness. “Except for the robot, I’ll turn her into a spitoon for my weiner.”
</p>
<p>
	“Well, we have found ourselves a lovely new crewmember, haven’t we?” Kellan whispered.
</p>
<p>
	HUM13 approached the man with a smile. “Hello, sir. I am Humie, the regular old human who identifies as male, I can understand the hair rollers might have confused you. I see you are an agent of the law.” HUM13 pointed to the sheriff’s badge on Grissom’s duster  “I was also a lawman before I realised that all cops are fascist pigs. I do so love your hat, may I please scan it so that I may print a version for myse…”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom swung Hallgrim like a bat, sending the two of them across the cargo bay and into a stack of those blocks from the old toy cartoons that they used to use to show an action figure’s missiles or kung-fu chopping action that were conveniently stacked there to demonstrate Grissom’s being a badass. He stepped forward out of the crate, and played three discordant notes on the keytar that temporarily opened a small glowing gold ring before it vanished. “How the hell did Doots play this damnable stringed bitch?”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan’s eyes raised at the device before she put her finger to her ear. “Asher, you and Florgo better get down here, our crazy cowboy cargo is about to kill us all with bad music and cursing.”
</p>
<p>
	HUM13 stepped out of the rubble and put Hallgrim back on his feet, then pulled a freshly printed stetson from his chest compartment and pushed it down on his head so his face wasn’t visible. When he looked up, he was sporting a Clint Eastwood style grimace. 
</p>
<p>
	“And bring your best coffin, because I’m your huckleberrybot or words to that effect that sound threatening.” HUM13 said before making a spitting noise but producing no actual spit. “Y’all.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	In the cockpit, Asher gripped the sticks and banked hard to the right to avoid a volley of fire, and into a dive towards the belt of rubbish surrounding the nearest planetoid. They were still four lightyears outside the Graydon nebula, running was next to impossible.
</p>
<p>
	“We’re a bit busy up here, sister.” Asher grunted. “Whatever western themed episodic caper you have found yourself in, you’ll have to deal with alone for now.”
</p>
<p>
	“Incoming!” Florgo shouted as a missile came flying towards them on the radar, putting his fingers in his ears.
</p>
<p>
	Asher turned the ship swiftly away from the detonation and then shook her head. “We’re in space, Florgo, missiles don’t make noise. Do something, use your magic for something other than being a useless waste of skin.”
</p>
<p>
	Florgo shrugged. “What do you want me to do? I’m inside, I can’t fire bolts or affect their ship from in here.”
</p>
<p>
	She stared at him. “What about the ship you’re in, Blandalf?” 
</p>
<p>
	“No one likes a back seat mage, Asher...” Florgo muttered as he raised his hands above his head. 
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly the ship behind them stopped dead, and scanned the trash belt they were hiding in. It moved from side to side and then stopped and backed slightly away. “What did you do?” Asher said. 
</p>
<p>
	Florgo looked proud of himself. “I made us look exactly like their ship, and now they're confused, like a cat looking at their own reflection.”
</p>
<p>
	“Well that unbelievable idiocy gives me slightly more hope about our chances.” Asher said. “Let’s get back to the cargo bay and find out what's happening.”
</p>
<p>
	As she crossed the gangway and approached the stairs down to the others, the sounds of fighting became louder, and though the fire from their pursuers had stopped, the ship shook just the same as Hum13 flew past them and smashed into the bulkhead in front of them.  Forgo ran to him, and as he pulled him up, the android’s eyes were spinning like slots. As they came to rest they displayed two Spacebuck symbols. A little slot in his chest opened and a moth flew out. 
</p>
<p>
	“Jack…poooot.” He said, woozily.
</p>
<p>
	Asher jumped over the railing and landed, knife already drawn. The crazed barbarian was currently locked in a wrestling hold with Oryx, and though there wasn’t a man in their dimension who could best the crocodilian, this guy seemed to be holding his own. 
</p>
<p>
	A whimper emanated from her right hand side, and she turned to find Kellan in a pile on the floor. Asher sat her up. “He’s a madman,” said Kellan. “He keeps shouting about Lionel Richie.”
</p>
<p>
	Asher looked perplexed. “The singer?”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan nodded. “He kept on and on ‘Where’s Lionel Richie? I’ll thump you Lionel! Lionel, you better answer me or I’ll feed you my fist and wear you like a mitten’.”
</p>
<p>
	“So he’s a brutish, toxic man, and he hates Motown - two reasons to slice him up.” 
</p>
<p>
	Before Asher could approach him, Kellan grabbed her arm. “Don’t hurt him - he obviously has some issues, and I need to get at that guitar thing he’s holding.” She thought for a second. “Give him the old Amray rush, like we used to with Dad?”
</p>
<p>
	“Though you’ll have to go low this time, short arse.” Asher smirked.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom tiredly backhanded Oryx, who fell to his knees, and as Asher approached she shouted at him to keep down. Kellan slid Risky-Business style and wrenched the keytar from the guy’s hands. Stupefied, he didn’t see Asher using Oryx’s back to get a leg up, and as she brought the knife down into his shoulder, he looked at her with a sudden recognition.
</p>
<p>
	“Tamia?” he said, as he fell to the floor, exhausted and in shock.
</p>
<p>
	“What did he call you?” Said Hallgrim as he pulled himself up and wiped a bloody nose. “You got some sort of stage name or something?”
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, it’s ‘Tamia the amazing Cyborg Circumcision Performer’, want to be my first audience participation?” Asher held her knife just out of it’s scabbard, then slammed it in with a click.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	“What is the holdup here?” The Watch, with his snake helm, said as he barged onto the bridge of the HMS JK Rowling.
</p>
<p>
	General Clamphands put his hand to his chin, accidentally catching it in his hydraulic press. “Watch your tongue, organic!” He was the heir apparent to the Technomancer, and he was not going to be ordered around by some dimension hopping humanoid, who didn’t even have any sort of upgrades - no clamphands, no robotic eyes, no built in heelies so he could skate around like a badass. He needed this win, he wasn’t going to be shown up by that upstart, General Lamphands - I mean, what sort of upgrade is that? Lamps for hands? Fucking idiot.
</p>
<p>
	The Helmsman, gerald, chirped up. General clamphands was proud, he’d really found his confidence since he got those heelies installed. “We have encountered some sort of reality shift, and we are in two places at once. It’s like some sort of magic.”
</p>
<p>
	“It is magic, you moron.” The Watch sighed. “It’s an old Veil trick. Look att he power readouts, behind that illusion that ship is tinier than the IQ of your team of robotic halfbreeds.”
</p>
<p>
	Clamphands stood and grabbed The Watch by the neck and squeezed. “You will find, outsider, that we have more than enough brains to do the thing…that you…wait repeat your insult to me, I have forgotten the point.”
</p>
<p>
	“My masters have promised you the chance to Rift.” Watch choked. “Just do what we ask and retrieve the girl, and you can go back into the past and help your Technomancer to win his war. You’ll bathe in glory, so long as I have Kellan.”
</p>
<p>
	General Clamphands let Watch fall to the floor, then moved to the navigational station and tried to grab the joystick there, but his clamps kept sliding off the column and he sighed. He turned to a subordinate and whispered hurriedly. “gerald, will you please set course for the other ship?”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Grissom woke to the sound of hubbub, as people bustled around him. He felt like his head was about to burst, as if he had downed too many Firewaters or had listened to Lionel talk about how ‘if you can get past some of the Christian allegories, Battlestar Galactica really is one of the greatest sci-fi epics ever’.
</p>
<p>
	He looked around slyly, pretending to still be unconscious. There was a cyborg and a droid that reminded him of Heath, though for some reason he seemed to be wearing the exact same outfit as Grissom. There was a giant Alligator who was reading a book on particle physics, and a hooded blonde rogue who gave him some serious Tamia vibes. And then at the foot of the campbed they had set up for him, sat a teenage girl with Doot’s keytar across her lap. These guys didn’t seem like they were working for Clamphands or that idiot Lamphands. They didn’t seem like they belonged here at all - were they alternate versions of his crew.
</p>
<p>
	“We leave in five, we need to get planetside and dodge whoever is chasing us to find Butch Cocksidy over there.” The blonde psychopath yelled across the bay. “Everyone pack light. No Hallgrim, you can’t pack your quantabyte drive of classic porn. Don’t look at me like that, wait…haven’t you already got a quantum computer for a brain? What do you mean you save your catalogue in case of a full information blackout?” Her voice faded.
</p>
<p>
	A diminutive little guy, who reminded him of Ludwig, wandered over to Kellan. He was dressed in some dungeons and dragons nerd shit, and Grissom wanted to immediately sit up and smack him in the face, or go get him laid or something.
</p>
<p>
	“So, any clues what that thing is?” The boy nodded down to the keytar.
</p>
<p>
	The girl shook her head. “No, but it’s obviously magical. I can feel the energy coming off of it. The guy looked like he was opening Rifts with it. Badly obviously because of his giant meaty hands, but still. I didn’t know there were machines that could do what I do, but then before Wrath I thought I was one of the only ones.”
</p>
<p>
	So they weren’t working with the Technomancer remnants? They seemed clueless to what it was they were embroiled in, and what Doots could do with that thing.
</p>
<p>
	“Hey Mister, who is Doots?” The girl asked. Grissom tried to ignore her but he could feel himself tensing up. “Don’t bother trying to pretend you aren’t awake, your lips move when you’re thinking.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom opened his eyes to find them all looking at him expectantly. 
</p>
<p>
	“I would like to sever your bonds, sir.” The Crocodile said, taking off his glasses and putting them in his pocket. “You don’t seem to be showing any signs of hibernation sickness now, can I have your word you won’t try and attack us again?”
</p>
<p>
	“That prick used me like a baseball bat, and you’re going…” Hallgrim started, but Asher turned to him and glared. 
</p>
<p>
	“One more word. I will replace your operating system with a loop of me doing this forever.” She cleared her throat then honked like a goose for a minute until Hallgrim held his hands up.
</p>
<p>
	“Alright, alright.”
</p>
<p>
	“I ain’t planning on attacking ya’s.” Grissom said. “I wasn’t really myself, hypersleep affects me pretty badly. I get kinda stabby.” He held a hand out to Kellan after the lizard cut him free. “Name’s Grissom Graves, I’m one of the Dukes of L..The New Dukes.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan remembered the laser pistol in Wrath’s collection. The last pistol of the Dukes of Lead. She took Grissom’s hand and introduced her friends. “Kellan Amray. My sister, Asher. Florgo, Oryx, Hallgrim, and Humie.” She took a breath. “We’re new to this reality, Grissom, And those bastards have been less than friendly.”
</p>
<p>
	“Clamphands is after that thing you have on your lap. I was taking it to a blacksmith friend of mine to find some way to destroy it before the Harvesters found me.”Grissom said, taking his hat from the robot and putting it back on his head. 
</p>
