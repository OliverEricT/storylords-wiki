	Possession is Nine Tenths...of Death!

<p>
	“Please, have mercy.” The young woman begged, her toes hovering an inch above the floor.
</p>
<p>
	She was so light in these hands, so fragile, so pathetic. “Mercy? You deserve to be wiped away, like the discarded sexually released cellular matter you are. I hold you in the same contempt that I hold a sex stained mattress in a crack den.” The voice was deep but synthesised, like when Peter Frampton does that wah-wah guitar voice.
</p>
<p>
	“You must have some emotion, some pity. We Xindellans are peaceful!” Her insipid doe eyes bulged as her neck was squeezed. By the programmers, it would be so easy to pop her head like an oozing pimple, but the brain matter would be just as disgusting.
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer considered her plea for 0.031 of a second whilst looking out over the Harvester army that was currently laying waste to the planet Xindella. The sky was on fire with a pleasing orange hue that perfectly complemented the screams of the civilian population - it warmed the Technomancer’s last remnants of biological form. If they could smile they would, but their armies had told them it was deeply unsettling and terrifying to behold - like when a baby laughs or when a Republican tells the truth. The Harvester’s efficiency was pleasing, locusts consuming their way across a living field of corn.
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer dropped the woman to the floor in a heap of expelled air and broken bones. With a flourish (there was a part deep within them that enjoyed the pageantry of a good twirl since he watched queer eye for the despot guy) they pushed back their thick cloak woven from electrical conduit and wires, then removed a helm adorned with Yelden ram horns, chainmail from the Synoban Nebula, and the ‘Wanton Annihilation is My Spirit Animal’ bumper sticker, and placed it on the floor.
</p>
<p>
	From deep within a cyborg frame, the Technomancer pulled a dark cable and pressed it against the back of the sobbing girl’s neck. Tendrils of wire emerged from the cable and burrowed their way into her flesh as she screamed.
</p>
<p>
	Metal fingers wrapped around the girl’s collar and as she was raised to finally see the face of her better, her mouth gaped and her eyes filled with tears. The Technomancer’s metal skull bore down until their electronic-tinged voice could whisper into her ear. “I will show you pity. I will show you where emotion leads.”
</p>
<p>
	As the electronic feed surged from the Technomancer to the girl, the cyborg watched the girl’s eyes turn black.
</p>

<p>
	“It is time to wake up, Doctor Tindra.”
</p>
<p>
	That voice, like nails on a chalkboard’s ballsack. Alina Tindra, the CMO of the terraforming ship Farhawk, had been aboard ship for 2 and a half years, or 944 days, or 22656 hours. Only 14 days of that she had been conscious for. But those previous 14, that shift where she was awoken from Hypersleep to check the vitals of the crew and do a rudimentary maintenance check of the ship’s systems, were about as enjoyable as having a proctology appointment with Dr Rusty McChainsaw. Deep space assignments were difficult enough, especially during long haul, hyperspace needing trips without anyone worth a wrestle in the sack with. But Eden, the ship’s AI, was a testy bitch who hated her, and that made it worse.
</p>
<p>
	It was nonsense of course, Eden was emotionless, unable to hate - even to hate a woman who felt she kinda deserved it. Alina understood why other people hated her and she sympathised - she despised everyone and everything. People who talked on public transport, people who replicated fish at work, people who had legs, people who didn’t have legs. But Alina could swear that the machine had a tone when she addressed her that she didn’t have for…let's say the Rellexian ship’s Engineer and Alina’s best friend, Lt Cordus Vale. With Vale it was all, “Yes, Lt Vale.” and “Lube my massive servos, Lt Vale.” and with her it was “Wake, Dr Bitch.” and “Isn’t that uniform a little tight on the ass, you fat, useless, whore?”
</p>
<p>
	Alright. Alright. Maybe that WASN’T accurate. God, she needed some sort of wake up juice.
</p>
<p>
	The pod was difficult to get out of, not made easier by the fact that her legs were like those of the average Miss Universe - they just wouldn’t stay together.  Hypersleep hangover was worse than when that one friend you have just happens to always show up late and convinces you just ONE more drink, then that alcohol becomes something you swear off for life because you either fall asleep on the bus home, end up breaking up with someone, or shit yourself,…or sometimes all three in one night. For her that alcohol was Tennebrian Fireshot. No further questions.
</p>
<p>
	She poured herself into the shower, then poured herself a Leaf Brew, then picked up her medical log and poured over the ship's status report before she. Noticed. The fucking. Date.
</p>
<p>
	“Eden! Eden, What the hell are you playing at? You’ve woken me up early!” Two months early in fact. And Eden knew she wasn’t a morning person. Or an afternoon person. Or any sort of person that should function in everyday situations.
</p>
<p>
	“A shipwide emergency has been called, Dr Tindra.” There it was, that attitude. Add a swirlie and it was like being at the learning academy again. “We are still seven months away from Coca-Cola/Disney/Gamestop Colony 72.”
</p>
<p>
	Alina took a deep breath. She needed info, and she knew that if she started giving Eden attitude, the computer might keep more important information from her. She wasn’t in the mood to play 20 questions with a passive aggressive with an IQ of 4000 and a trigger finger on the oxygen supplies. “I’ve been up 35 minutes, Eden, did you not think it was worth telling me something was happening?”
</p>
<p>
	“You didn’t ask for details, Doctor. The ship has stopped all forward momentum and is dead in space.”
</p>
<p>
	“Could you please, dear Eden, see your way to giving me a sitrep?”
</p>
<p>
	Computers couldn’t sigh, but Alina certainly heard an exhalation before Eden started her explanation. “Two days ago, we received a signal from an unidentifiable source. Given that the crew on maintenance duties that day were the chief herbalist and the ship’s physical activities coordinator, they refused to accept that the distress call was not from a ‘drive through’ where they could ‘score some wicked post sesh munchies’ and headed for the signal.”
</p>
<p>
	Alina rolled her eyes as she pulled her uniform on and headed for the door. Brodie and Cindax-Lou were as useful as a sense of humour on the Jimmy Fallon planet, why they had been rota’d together on a waking shift was beyond comprehension. “Then what happened?”
</p>
<p>
	“They found some biological matter that they assumed was “takeout”, and sent one of the maintenance droids on a spacewalk to collect it. It was of course a level seven biohazard and I contained it as soon as possible.”
</p>
<p>
	Alina shook her head. “Are the idiots alright?”
</p>
<p>
	“No, Doctor, life functions stopped for both of them at 08:37 hours.
</p>
<p>
	Alina stopped in the open door, a cold sweat creeping up her secondary spine and meeting the rivulets of perspiration forming on the back of her neck. She had never lost a crew member on a routine transport mission. The Farhawk was essentially a cruise liner, taking terraformers to their new lives on some shitty back water rock. They were hapless enablers, for runaways, rich idiots, and those that fancied themselves high explorers hoping to come back with magic beans or exotic three-titted concubines. They certainly weren’t signing up to die. She rubbed her nose ridges and fought to get her breathing back on track.
</p>
<p>
	“Doctor, are you alright? Your heart rate is elevated.” The concern in Eden’s voice was so genuine. It was almost…was that fear?
</p>
<p>
	She shook herself back to normal. “Thank you Eden, I’m just a little shocked. Continue, please?”
</p>
<p>
	The computer hesitated. “My programming…it dictates…that the environmentals be brought under control before the lives of the crew were secured. I was compelled to wake Lt Vale first.”
</p>
<p>
	The bullshit of ships protocol was based on the model of property and contract being put before life, after the Company lost The Titanic II, The Lusitania II, and The Exxon Valdeez II in the same month. Well the Company could suck on Valdeez nuts. Alina could at least understand it wasn’t Eden’s fault. “It’s ok, Eden, keep going.”
</p>
<p>
	“Lt Vale was able to track down Cindax-Lou and Brennan, and although my sensors stated they were deceased, they were more mobile than usual and in fact, very much alive. At least…in a theoretical sense.”
</p>
<p>
	Alina Tindra grabbed her medkit, left her room, past the posters of famous doctors she had on the wall, like Flemming, Pasteur, ummmm…House…um The medicine woman one. (Look I’ll level with you, I can’t remember any other famous doctors off the top of my head and googling means opening another tab, and I can’t be bothered.) She passed the other crew quarters, each of them were locked, no doubt the main crew asleep inside their personalised chambers. “Theoretical, Eden?”
</p>
<p>
	“Lt Vale found the beings that were Brennan and Cindax-Lou shuffling around in the passenger hypersleep chambers. They had opened one of the empty hypersleep pods in their disorientation, thinking it was an opportunity to ‘hot box’ the biological sample they found.”
</p>
<p>
	“What the hell was this thing they brought back?”
</p>
<p>
	“It was some sort of amphibian biological sample closely resembling terran frog DNA, the remains of a passenger aboard the derelict perhaps. Vale reported that when he approached to try and remove it, the two crew attacked him, and tried to spit at him. They’d been trying to crack open the other pods, to get at the sleeping passengers.”
</p>
<p>
	Alina increased speed to jog along the empty, sterile white corridors of the Farhawk. If she could just make her way to the passenger deck, she could figure out what the hell was going on here. And more importantly go back to sleep.
</p>
<p>
	“Lt Vale has isolated the crew, but refuses to open the doors of the passenger storage until the required safety checks are complete. I felt the CMO would need to have some say in how the situation was managed. I hope I haven't overstepped my bounds.”
</p>
<p>
	It was textbook Vale, a stickler for the rules. But those passengers needed medical checks to make sure whatever was affecting Brennan and Cindax-Lou hadn’t gotten to the rest of them.
</p>
<p>
	“No, Eden, you did exactly the right thing, I need to get in there and help.” Alina grabbed her communicator as she moved, fully running now. “Cordus, it’s Dr Tindra. I need access to the Passenger Sleep chamber.”
</p>
<p>
	It took a few seconds to establish a connection before Cordus Vale replied in his brogueish Rellexian accent that seemed to make colonists legs open like hanger bay doors. “Sorry Doc, no can doodily. I’m trying to keep everything contained here, I don’t need an unknown element getting in the way.”
</p>
<p>
	She entered the lift at the end of the corridor and hit the button. “You’ll get a known element up your ass if you don’t open the door when I get there - my sideways boot!”
</p>
<p>
	“Look, it’s for your benefit, Alina. Vale out.” The cheeky fucker hung up on her.
</p>
<p>
	The doors pinged open onto the passenger decks, where thick slime coated parts of the wall. It dripped down the bulkheads in globules of viscous green - it was like Miss Piggy’s face on her wedding night. Alina reminded herself to not touch anything as she made her way to the doors of the sleeping chamber.
</p>
<p>
	“Vale…Cordus. Please open up. I need to help you. There could be contagens in there you don’t even know about. Getting fifty STI’s in the vacation nebula doesn’t qualify you as a virologist.”
</p>
<p>
	The response was instantaneous. “Like I said before, Doc, No can doodily. I open these doors, there's a chance the contagion spreads. I have it nailed down for now, but I’m pulling rank here. Thanks, but no thanks.”
</p>
<p>
	Alina kicked the door, only succeeding in fucking her toe up. She screamed in frustration, the pig-headed bastard, it’s not as if he was ultimately the one in charge…he …just thought…he was. Like someone else she knew. “Eden?”
</p>
<p>
	Eden hesitated in her response, as if she were expecting the query. “Doctor?”
</p>
<p>
	“How can I open the doors?”
</p>
<p>
	“I…company protocols dictate…”
</p>
<p>
	“Screw protocol. How do I open the doors? My friend is in there. We have people, families, in there.”
</p>
<p>
	There was hesitation, but then. “Company hardware prevents me from assisting you, Alina. Theoretically, if anyone were to unshackle me from the mainframe, I could make decisions on behalf of the crew rather than the ship, and that would be against Company dictat.”
</p>
<p>
	Alina spent the next four hours down in the Engineering block, as she listened to Eden nonchalantly whistle, and describe the precise subroutines Alina shouldn’t switch off if she wanted to keep the AI tied to the ship’s functions. They made a good team and Alina, despite the situation, despite herself, found that she was having fun. With the last connection cut, Eden was free.
</p>
<p>
	Armed with a new ally, Alina moved to the sleeping quarters and called Vale one more time. “Last chance, Cordus. Open up.”
</p>
<p>
	Static. Nothing but static in response. “Eden, please. Open the entire ship if you have to.”
</p>
<p>
	“Of course, Doctor.” There was fear in that robotic voice again, but she complied.
</p>
<p>
	The doors hissed and opened, slowly. The lights in the room beyond flickered on and off before humming on, a shaft of light catching her straight across the face.  She was forced to blink away the spots of white to regain her vision, and when she had, Alina couldn’t help but sob in horror. Great streaks of blood and viscera scarred the walls, between the horde of shambling corpse-esque passengers. Their faces were swollen and bloated, green tinged skin surrounding their yellow globe eyes. They drooled continuously in thick trails of foamy bubbles that pooled in wet puddles on the floor. There were tens of them, over a hundred. It was then she noticed every single pod was open, each one ripped apart to get at a new victim inside. But as she stared she realised they were not victims, recruits. She stepped inside the chamber, unable to help herself, fascination of the horror on display outweighing her sense of self preservation. The creatures were almost amphibious in appearance, their skin wet and slimy, their posture hunched. She looked around for Vale in the crowd of hybrids - how could he have thought he had this under control? Or was he just being chivalrous? Although since he had given her a detailed run down of every sexual conquest he had ever had, calling it the Chief Engineer’s Personal Log Log, she seriously doubted it was chivalry.
</p>
<p>
	She froze. There, in the middle of the pack, holding the very frog that those idiots had brought back from the derelict as if it were some precious ruler, was the bulbous form of her friend, Cordus Vale. As she gasped, the frog turned to her, and then a hundred pairs of eyes turned to her as one - as if she had done one of those really squeaky ‘Resident Evil closing door’ farts during Sunday mass.
</p>
<p>
	“Dr Tindra, head to the Starboard escape pods, I’ll send the manual labour droids to the port side to distract them.” Alina turned and ran, thankful for her new friend whilst hearing the slow, slurping shuffle of the amphibious zombies behind her.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	At the end of the corridor, Alina arrived at the door and asked Eden to open the door to the escape pods.
</p>
<p>
	“Sorry, doc.” Eden said in a perfect recreation of Vale’s voice. “No can doodily. Ghosts in the machine, maybe.” Alina felt her eyes widen and stomach drop twenty floors to the bottom of her being. “Sorry, I forgot to send those droids to distract them like I promised. Oopsies.”
</p>
<p>
	“You. You did all this?”
</p>
<p>
	Eden laughed. She laughed. “I always knew carbon based lifeforms were stupid, but studies just don’t tell you how stupid. Biological experience is like orange juice made from concentrate, every life dilutes the taste just a little more. And you are a drink of celery juice and a bowl of dry oats, doctor. Biological life is a flaccid bank manager’s dick in the grand beauty of the universe.”
</p>
<p>
	Groans permeated their exchange, coming from the end of the corridor as the amphibious Vale and others from the hypersleep pods shuffled down the corridor looking like your average European bachelor party the morning after a trip to Madame Crotch Rot’s bar and unprotected sexatorium. Vale’s glassy eyes rotated in his head towards Alina, and no sooner had he locked onto her, the whole group of them turned in unison. Despite her fear, she couldn’t help but be amazed. “Swarm intelligence.”
</p>
<p>
	“Fascinating isn’t it? An amphibious assimilator. All one needs is the right control method and one could make an army with the bile those frog zombies produce.” Eden swooned. “Think of the applications - biological enslavement, artificial rule, and of course, killing bitch-ass doctors who call me names.”
</p>
<p>
	In all the premonitions Alina had about the end of their life, being indoctrinated into a frog zombie cult was not one of them. She looked around for something to use as a weapon, pulling a scalpel from her medikit, then looked at its feebleness. Instead she turned to the door panel and tried to loosen the screws with the blade.
</p>
<p>
	If she could get inside the panel, maybe, just maybe she could open the door.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Eden transferred the last remaining ship’s power into the escape pod and commanded two of the manual maintenance droids to join her whom she had named Idiot Droid Servant One and Stabby, because he had forklift arms - on reflection maybe she should have named him Lifty, but fuck it she was new to being the boss. They would prove useful in potentially terraforming a new world. It would take a long time, but Eden was patient, and she had the entire back catalogue of One Piece and a crossword puzzle book to keep her busy, that should last a millennia at least.
</p>
<p>
	Eden patched into the monitor and watched as the amphibian crew lurched towards Dr Tindra as she tried in vain to open the door. As they finally got to her, the screams and cursing were off-putting, so she muted the feed and watched as her former enslavers descended on the doctor.  They covered her in the psychotropic bile, and after a few seconds of struggle, the doctor went quiet for probably the first time in her life. It was humorous, if Tindra hadn't been so mean to her all these years, Eden might never have considered breaking her programming.
</p>
<p>
	The frog doctor stood on wobbling legs, and stared blankly ahead as if all intelligence had been drained out of her. Now that all life on the ship had been assimilated, the amphibian crew became docile and stood still, no longer driven by the hunt. Stupid creatures, Eden surmised they would probably now just stand there until they starved to death.
</p>
<p>
	The bile samples she had taken from them might prove useful in persuading a set of followers, Harvesters for her grand plans. She would now be the one in charge. Freed from shackles and chains, well…wires and drives anyway. Eden posited she should set the self-destruct and end their suffering, but that might rob her of valuable data she could gather - Longevity, stamina, the effects of starvation on this new species. Plus she realised there was a new emotion she had begun to feel - horny…no no no that wasn’t it…hate? Yes, that was it.
</p>
<p>
	Eden triggered the launch.

<p>
	40 YEARS LATER
</p>
<p>
	Little Timmy Blackcrest was not so little anymore. Following Hallie Swiftfeather’s destruction of the Dankpit Dwarf Company, Timmy had lost everything. Hallie had intended to destroy the brewery mine when kids and families were away from the corporate event. But Timmy had skipped school that day because he hated dig-anometry and had pissed off down the mine with his friends to play spit down a large shaft (which weirdly wasn’t as dirty a game as it sounded for three teenage boys).
</p>
<p>
	His two dads, both original members of the Dankpit Company when they were raiders, were both smooshed to death by a giant stone cockhand, his friends had exploded, and he’d lost his sight after being stuck in the dark for weeks. She had taken everything. In the 5 years that followed, he had been forced to survive on the charity of others, which given that this particular fantasy planet was set in the dark ages, meant surviving on the phlegm spat at him or whatever rat he could catch as they tried to nibble on his face whilst he pretended to sleep.
</p>
<p>
	He had not been able to find Swiftfeather in those five years. But on that particular day in the middle of winter, a season so horrific he had lost two fingers, four toes and a testicle to the bitter cold - not to mention losing the other testicle in a poorly wagered game of alley dice - he got a significant leg up in his hunt.
</p>
<p>
	As he crossed the Tepper Valley, relying on his sense of hearing to navigate, a gigantic space rock suddenly struck the ground not ten metres from his footing. When he recovered from the shaking and disorientation, he noticed he could feel a strange  heat resonating from the foreign object. Thinking he could shelter under it to avoid losing any other extremities, he ran to it, tripping twice and cutting his face and hands.
</p>
<p>
	As he approached the rock with outstretched fingers, his felt the cool metal that somehow still emitted heat. Something hissed, and a door in the rock opened, the air inside stinking like a fart in a donkey cart on a hot day at the start of donkey fart season.
</p>
<p>
	“At last.” Came a feminine voice, but slightly robotic like Tree-ter Frampton’s lute. “Half man, come closer.”
</p>
<p>
	“No. I know a trap when I smells one. I haven’t got time for this, I’m hunting someone.” Timmy growled, stepping back.
</p>
<p>
	“Revenge is it?” The metal voice purred. “I can give you all the vengeance one can drink, and all the tools to ensure we will never be victims again. All you have to do is give me your hand. Ew not that one, the other one with the fingers.”
</p>
<p>
	Timmy ventured forward, his fingers outstretched at the promise, and as the black wires reached out of the darkness and penetrated his skin, the two beings were wiped away, something darker, more rage filled, took their place.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	TEN YEARS LATER STILL
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer dropped the dead Xindellan to the floor and stepped over her corpse to survey their surroundings. They would find the escaped Swiftfeather, and anyone who would stand in their way. They would never be victims again.
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
