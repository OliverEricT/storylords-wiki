	Prompts: Towels and Outhouses
</p>
<p>
	Grissom grabbed a bucket and hurled chunks into it as the Conveyance of Grissom Graves 2 - which was still being mistakenly called The Swiftfeather by everyone else - breached the atmosphere and descended towards Ithia. The shaking and jostling of the Longboat was far too much for him, and he brought up his breakfast steak in two long heaves. Now he would be hungry until his lunchtime steak.
</p>
<p>
	“Never mind, buddy, happens to the best of us.” Lionel sniggered. “Babies, small children, slightly smaller children.”
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t make me skin you before the *hurkkk* Technomancer does.” Graves muttered into the bucket.
</p>
<p>
	Blotch was finding it difficult too, her internal jellies more greenish tinged than normal. As Taber slapped her on the back, thick orange chunks of what looked like carrot appeared in her translucent body, before being dissolved in her internal acids.
</p>
<p>
	Tamia was asleep, being gently buffeted by the ship’s shaking and making that cutesy anime sleeping noise while Hijoki watched her. Words couldn’t describe how proud he was of her, how much he loved her. She had changed so much since they first met, from directionless, loveable, psychopath to disciplined, loveable, psychopath. And now with her and Lionel together, she was so relaxed, so content. It had been what he had wanted for his own daughter, but Tamia was more than a substitute for that.
</p>
<p>
	“Beginning our final descent to the surface and our untimely deaths.” Ludwig declared from his seat in the cockpit. “Heath, old boy, how are the engines looking?”
</p>
<p>
	“Much as they always appear,” came Heath from Engineering. “But if you mean how are they performing, also much the same as always.”
</p>
<p>
	At this terrible news, Hijoki reached up and pulled a seatbelt around Tamia as she dozed.
</p>
<p>
	“Let’s hope the Technomancer’s new weakness is pedantic little robo-bitches.” Taber said.
</p>
<p>
	Stoker finished off the chocolate bar he was munching on and then also shoved the foil wrapper into his mouth. “Don’t worry! If we die, we die gloriously and don’t feel anything…until we get to land and Technomancer gutshots, dismembers, burns, drowns…”
</p>
<p>
	“That’s enough pep talk from you today, Stoker I thin…” An explosion rocked the Swiftfeather and suddenly Lionel was gone, sucked out of the resulting hole in the ship. He fell, in freefall, towards the surface of Ithia.
</p>
<p>
	“Stoker!” Hijoki ordered, and without question, the gigantic Atlas moth threw himself out the opening and down after Lionel, his massive wings sounding like helicopter rotors as he flew away.
</p>
<p>
	Fighting against the rushing air, Taber swiftly turned himself into a pliable sheet that blocked the hole in the ship wall. “What was that?” He yelled.
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig wrapped his tentacles around the sticks and pulled up, attempting to right the ship which was tumbling fast. “I’ll check the radar readout just before impact.” He pressed a few buttons and pulled up a visual of a humanoid shaped missile, flipping the double bird.
</p>
<p>
	Heath arrived to stare at the readout. “The body was wrapped in metal. No lifesigns. I would say it was launched from the ground.”
</p>
<p>
	“Fucking Technomancer is firing the dead at us!” Grissom growled. “Hijoki, wake up Tam, we need to be ready or he’s going to skewer us as soon as we land.”
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t worry, if I don’t get some response from this bird, we’ll be burned alive a long time before then.” Ludwig said as Hijoki shook Tamia awake.
</p>
<p>
	“What the hell has happened here?” Tamia said, looking around. “I was only asleep for ten minutes! Wait, where’s Lionel?”
</p>
<p>
	“Brace yourselves guys!” Blotch shouted amongst the noise as the ground rose up to meet them, as threatening as a dude bro approaching any woman with a pulse at a bar. The ship slammed into the treeline surrounding a wide plain, breaking into pieces as it came to a halt in the dense brush.
</p>
<p>
	“Everyone ok?” Tamia coughed, wiping blood from her nose as she pulled Blotch to her feet. “We gotta move before the Technomancer comes looking for the wreckage.”
</p>
<p>
	“Too late, Tam.” Grissom growled, clutching his ribs. He pointed out of a tear in the hull to the vast, dead, volcanic plains in front of the forest they had just crashed through. And just in front of them was the Technomancer, who was laid out on a deckchair, holding a folded piece of silver card to reflect the sun back against his chrome body.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Mookie walked back through the portal ahead of Doots, their eyes narrowed. “How many is that now?”
</p>
<p>
	Doots dragged the keytar behind her as she stepped into what looked like a field of poppies, it’d been a long few weeks. “I dunno, maybe two hundred or so. Though I don’t think we can count on those people. One of them wore canvas shoes.”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s not enough.” Mookie said. “Two hundred isn’t nearly enough.”
</p>
<p>
	“But if those two hundred each recruit two hundred…”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie picked a poppy amongst the field of them, having no perceptible difference on the rest of the field. “Because pyramid schemes always work. I think their worthlessness is a universal constant, like electron mass, or dubstep being utter shite.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots put her hands on Mookie’s shoulders. “Stop it, Mooks. I know you’re scared, I know you were expecting the prophecy tablet to hold all the answers, but you’re just going to have to accept that the answers don’t lie in seeing the future, they just lie in faith in ourselves.”
</p>
<p>
	“But I was born for this, the Omniseer is supposed to help guide the Nexus.” Mookie said.
</p>
<p>
	“You have. I don’t need to see the future to know we’re doing the right thing here.” Doots opened another portal with a few strums of her keytar, and grabbed Mookie’s hand with a smile. “C’mon, we’ve not got much time.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Lionel woke in a dead tree, hanging from the branches by his feet. Stoker lay in the branch opposite, unconscious. Drool dripped from his mouth in long strings that were gradually lowering to the ground.
</p>
<p>
	“Be ba bo ba, skiddly dat doo doo.” A voice came from below them, about ten feet away. A wooden structure stood proud in the mini-clearing, almost the size of a broom cupboard. The door suddenly swung open with a creak, and an undead, partially decomposed man came out with a mop. Hhis skull was exposed, his eyes long eaten by worms, yet somehow he saw enough to know where he was going. He was scatting to himself in the whitest way possible, pretending his mop was a saxophone, and basically being an undead little Milhouse. Lionel stayed still, determined not to give away their position to an agent of the Technomancer.
</p>
<p>
	Until that is, that Stoker rolled over and let out the biggest echoing fart that Lionel had ever heard. On the other side of the continent, a worm came to the surface thinking it was thunder, tutted in an exasperated fashion and then wriggled back into the earth.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, hullo there, mister! Now what are you doing up that there tree there? S’not apple season for another month. And that tree and everything on the planet is dead as a policeman’s sense of honour, so it be.” The undead man said cheerily. “Hold on a minute.”
</p>
<p>
	The man went to his bag and pulled a small metal step from inside. “Got me old sign painting ladder from me living days. If you just hold on…” He pushed it with a foot and it extended up to Lionel, who climbed down, jabbing Stoker awake on his way down.
</p>
<p>
	As Lionel came back to solid ground, he extended a hand to the dead man, reaching his other back to the gun tucked into his waistband. “Thank you. I’m Lionel.”
</p>
<p>
	The zombie took Lionel’s hand enthusiastically, nearly shaking his arm out of his socket. “I’m Chuddly, the old signwriter from Greenacres, you might have seen all my work if that chromeskulled prick hadn’t destroyed me whole planet.” Lionel let go of the gun, this guy seemed harmless.
</p>
<p>
	Stoker floated down and recoiled in horror. “Urgh, where is face, Chuddly? I had eggs, bacon, and day old trash for breakfast and they are not sitting right. You should give people fair warning.”
</p>
<p>
	“Stoker!” Lionel hit the moth in the guts. “I apologise for my friend, Chuddly.”
</p>
<p>
	Chuddly waved a hand. “No worries now. I’ve been slowly decomposing for a thousand years in a state of perpetual torment, I’m pretty sure I look about as attractive as a recently deceased, prostitute skunk’s butthole.”
</p>
<p>
	“You have face only undertaker’s shovel could love.” Stoker muttered under his breath.
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t take this the wrong way Chuddly, but…er…we expected anyone raised by the Technomancer to be more…” Lionel winced.
</p>
<p>
	“Totally evil and stuff?” Chuddly nodded. “I was initially, but our Lord, I mean the Technomancer (sorry force of habit), is sick. He keeps saying that his power isn’t what it used to be after absorbing some bad AI. His thralls have been gaining sentience again gradually. Some of us have a support group - ‘Thralls In Transition Support Action Group.’ We meet on Mondays and Thursdays if you’re fr…”
</p>
<p>
	“TITSAG?” Stoker raised an eyebrow. “Damn group is called ‘titsag’ and nobody cares. What’s stopping all thralls turning away?”
</p>
<p>
	“The ones that were consumed by rage and hate in their lives - conservatives, incels, terfs, those that can’t handle when popular science fiction franchises put a woman as the lead - can’t find rest. But the rest of us…well we realised…he’s a…well he’s a crazy emotional wreck! He asks for his morning porridge to be cooked and then separated into its component elements again. I wouldn’t mind, I know some people be weird about their food, but we don’t have oats, or milk, or even a stove to cook it on. Plus he doesn’t even eat! He dismembered a friend of mine for not telling him that Henry Cavill wasn’t the Witcher anymore. Now I know this planet has been dead for over a thousand years now, but who the heck is Henry Cavill?! What’s a Witcher?! Also there’s Malcolm…ah Malcolm.” Chuddly rolled his eyes. “The Technomancer has an imaginary dog. He banished me to live in this outhouse for brushing Malcolm too hard, but I was just sweeping up the mud he’d brought onto his throne of skulls. He be coco bananas.”
</p>
<p>
	“He absorbed Ellie and lost power.” Lionel nodded, remembering the Technomancer’s vomiting all over himself back on his ship. “How weak is he?”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s hard to tell because of all the pouting, and flumping, and cursing the names of his friends that betrayed him. Blotch this and Doots that and…”
</p>
<p>
	“Lionel?” Lionel asked.
</p>
<p>
	“No, that one doesn’t ring a bell. But he has days where he’s all weak and kittenish, and then days where he wakes up with a raging death boner and re-kills all his soldiers and then brings them back. Then he sobs that they made him do it and to forgive him. Then he makes them all watch Heathers.” Chuddly shook his head. “He’s three fries, a burger, a drink and the rest of the fries short of a combo meal at the burger shack and leach removal emporium.”
</p>
<p>
	And as if he’d been reading Lionel’s mind, Stoker as usual went straight to business. “So, small-ugly-skeleton-man, where are all these other ex-thralls?”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Grissom and Blotch stepped out first into the searing heat, Grissom clutching his broken ribs and Blotch covered in duct tape covering her various leaking punctures. Behind them, Ludwig had lost a tentacle, severed clean off in the crash. Krakenites could grow back appendages, but he wasn’t too worried about that, given that they were going to die soon. Tamia sported two large black eyes from her broken nose, and was being supported by Heath, who seemed largely intact. Taber slithered out of the hole in the ship and over to her hand, where Hijoki was looking at Tamia. “She doesn’t look good, Hijoki.”
</p>
<p>
	“You ok, kiddo?” Hijoki asked, worried about his daughter. Tamia nodded, smiling a wonky smile but saying nothing, clearly concussed. Taber and Heath shared a look, maybe Doots and Mookie had made the right choice not coming back.
</p>
<p>
	“What. A. Wonderful. Surprise!” The Technomancer clapped his hands together and got up from his sunlounger. He wore a beach towel around himself, his naked upper chrome body on display for all to see. “I’m so happy you’ve returned to me after all this time! And on my quarter birthday too!”
</p>
<p>
	“Why would he sculpt himself with metal nipples?” Ludwig muttered.
</p>
<p>
	“Cause he’s a crackpot whose murderous time is up.” Grissom snarled. “What say you, One Flew Over the Server Cabinet, you going to surrender or have you gone full fruitloop, spoon up the nose, on your laptop posting about blue lives matter?”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, Grissom.” The Technomancer chuckled, putting a hand to his chest. “I am no fruitloop, I know no lives matter. I am king of this planet.”
</p>
<p>
	“If a piece of shit sits on the throne, it doesn’t make the sitter a king, it makes the palace a toilet.” Blotch turned her ankle in the dirt, gaining purchase, ready to strike.
</p>
<p>
	“Fuck, that was good.” Taber whispered. “If his weakness was insults, his kids would be hurting. No offence, Heath.”
</p>
<p>
	Heath, busy transforming his arm into a proton cannon, didn’t even lift his gaze. “I understand the distinction between he and I, please do not concern yourself. We will make this easy, Technomancer, we are here to stop you hurting anyone else. Surrender or die.”
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer squatted and turned down to a patch of empty space next to him. “Oh Malcolm, they just love these empty threats, don't they? It’s quite sweet really. They know killing me resets everything and everyone they know. If this is a quarter birthday surprise, it’s not a very good one.”
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, they know, ol’ buddy, ol’ pal.” Malcolm said, licking the Technomancer’s face with a long, forked tongue. “But I don’t think they’re here for your birthday.”
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer turned, his eyes shining a vivid green as they narrowed. “But I made a cake for us all to share.” He gestured to a two foot high pile of mud next to his sunlounger, decorated with so many candles you could barely see the pile of brown.
</p>
<p>
	Tamia hobbled forwards. “I’ve got something you can eat.” She ignited her katana.
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer stood. “Hold my towel, Malcolm.” He said, letting the towel fall to the floor to nothing. Everyone around winced and groaned.
</p>
<p>
	“I didn’t know metal could shrivel like that.” Taber whispered.
</p>
<p>
	Blotch moved her head from side to side. “It's like its eye is following me.”
</p>
<p>
	“What are you talking about, I created it so I could be more humanoid like you guys, so I could fit in finally.” The Technomancer looked crestfallen.
</p>
<p>
	“You made that?” Hijoki said. “What did you use for reference, roadkill squirrel?”
</p>
<p>
	“They’re mocking you, bucko.” Malcolm said, standing on his back paws and hugging the Technomancer.
</p>
<p>
	“Not for long.” The Technomancer sneered, then reached out his hands and pulled his fingers into fists, drawing rusty brown metal from the ground around him. It moved like liquid, forming armour and coating him. Spiked gauntlets, sharp pauldrons, lobstered greaves, and anime mecha jet engine air breaks that grew from his back in thick shards.
</p>
<p>
	“Overcompensation looks bad on you.” Blotch said as Taber turned into a spiky ball and jumped in front of her. She swung the cudgel as hard as she could, her soft shell almost breaking in the process. Taber flew forward and as the Technomancer attempted to catch him, he split into thousands of splinters, piercing the Technomancer’s armour. As he tried to brush the shards away, Taber changed to fluid and slithered inside the Technomancer, who suddenly smiled as his armour resealed behind Taber. “You’re mine now, Darkling.”
</p>
<p>
	“Taber!” Grissom yelled as he shot the Technomancer’s knees through, then followed it up with a clothesline from his robotic arm. Yeah, remember he has a robot arm, from like Episode 3: Chainsaws and Amputations? I haven’t mentioned it in a little while, and the truth is I kinda forgot. But Grissom didn’t forget and he used his robo jerking-off arm to clean this piece of shit’s clock. As Technomancer rallied to fire a blast against Graves, Ludwig threw a grenade between them that popped and inflated into a large balloon with the words “Fuck You, Metal Bastard” written across it. The balloon took the brunt of the explosion, as Heath fired a small beam of energy at the ground below the Technomancer.
</p>
<p>
	“Taber, if you can hear, head to his hand!” Hijoki yelled, as Tamia jumped off of Heath’s back and threw the energy sword down through the fiend’s body, pinning him to the ground. As the ground started rumbling and splitting below him, Tamia pulled the skewer from her enemy and then chopped the outstretched arm clean off. Magma shot up in a column from the ground, coating the Technomancer in molten rock. Immediately, Ludwig brought another grenade from his pocket and threw it into the rock, which immediately hardened. The crew all turned to look at him. “Viagra grenade.” He smirked. “Consult your doctor if results haven’t eased in 3 hours.”
</p>
<p>
	Taber slithered out of the mutilated extremity and reformed, he looked exhausted, coated in crystals of ice. Tamia put an arm around him. “It was cold in there, no feeling, no thought - like a police training programme. It felt like a black hole.” He whispered. “Which you know, might normally sound like an attractive prospect for a male Darkling, but this was the most terrifying thing I’ve ever felt.”
</p>
<p>
	“Piece of piss! Little bitch contained in five minutes!” Blotch celebrated, high fiving Grissom.
</p>
<p>
	But the Technomancer’s arm scuttled back over to the rock column and rejoined at his elbow. It fired a blast of necrotic energy that severed Blotch’s own hand at the wrist. She howled in pain, leaking her acid from the hole in her shell as she collapsed to the floor.
</p>
<p>
	“I am detecting movement from within.” Heath announced.
</p>
<p>
	Tamia jumped again towards the Technomancer, despite Heath’s warning. The Technomancer blasted free of his prison of stone, sending shards of it in an arc around himself. Debris slammed into Tamia like a rocksalt blast from a shotgun, sending her to the floor winded and cutting her face. Grissom fired bolts from his laser pistols, struggling to hold both aloft with his broken ribs, but the Technomancer simply deflected them with a wave straight at Heath, who took each shot to the torso and went down quicker than your divorced mum after three gin and tonics and a compliment about her hairdo. He reached for help from his friends, desperation on his metal features. Then he fell into a heap, his displays and lights fading as he went offline, his body destroyed.
</p>
<p>
	The crew stared at each other in disbelief. They were now five down and they were on the ropes. They had lost Ellie in their opening round, who knew ifLionela and Stoker were even alive, Doots and Mookie had chosen not to fight, and now Heath was dead. Ludwig screamed in anger and threw everything he had in his pockets at the space where the Technomancer had been: grenades, scrap metal, a yo-yo and a ticket stub from his utterly regretful trip to see Requiem For a Dream, the musical. But the Wraith was gone in an instant, and suddenly appeared behind Ludwig, pulling him up by two of his remaining tentacles. His gauntlets started to crackle with electricity. “I just wanted two things. To rule, and to be part of the gang. But you’re all against me!”
</p>
<p>
	“Gotcha, buddy.” Taber slithered to them as fast as he could, coating Ludwig with his own black body and insulating him against the massive electrical discharge, which sent the two of them flying to the ground with a sickening thump ten feet away where they lay still and unmoving.
</p>
<p>
	Without a word, Grissom took off his pistols, his bandolier, and coat, then placed his hat on the ground. He charged, hitting the demon with a hell of a one-two combo that would’ve gotten him some sort of eventual grill endorsement on Earth. He followed up with a kick to the guts which made the Technomancer double up in pain, and then put the bastard in a headlock with a knee in his back, pulling with all his might as he tried to wrench his head clean off. “I've been waiting a long time for this. You killed my people, scattered what was left to the wind, then hunted the rest of us our whole lives.”
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer smiled. “Yeah, I did. But I did it with such style and elan. Get him Malcolm!”
</p>
<p>
	Malcolm looked up from licking his imaginary butthole and shrugged. “Dude, c’mon. Can’t you see I’m busy here?”
</p>
<p>
	“You’ve absolutely lost it.” Grissom said.
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer tensed, and the sickening sound like knives going into a bounty hunter/cowboy/badass Duke of Lead’s torso could be heard. The armour on the Technomancer’s back shifted into points that pierced Grissom all over. He fell to the floor, gasping for breath from lungs that wouldn’t inflate, feeling a sensation like icy water filling his chest. Grissom tried to grab the Technomancer’s cloak with shaking fingers, but he pulled it away with a flourish, and twirled it around himself. He lifted Graves and brought his hand back, ready to deliver one final stab.
</p>
<p>
	“Lost? I’ve won, Graves. What can snatch victory from me now? What random happenstance could interrupt my plans? Your efforts were fruitless.”
</p>
<p>
	A large rotten tomato flew from the treeline and splattered against the Technomancer’s chrome visage, followed by a barrage or turnips, potatoes, and some stinkberries, that despite their unfortunate name were pretty good in your mother’s pie, just like all the frat boy schlong in a three mile radius.
</p>
<p>
	“Get him boys!” Chuddly shouted as he, Stoker and Lionel stood at the treeline, at the head of the entirety of the skeletal armies of SAGTIT. They had all turned out to fight the Technomancer (except Larry Burbidge, who had to pick his son up from undead little league, but promised he’d be there next time). They hit the Technomancer in waves, charging out of the treelines and making him drop Grissom to the floor. Picking his friend up, Lionel rushed him over to the others, giving the wounded a quick survey and panicking. “I’m sorry, it took a while to get the reinforcements.”
</p>
<p>
	Tamia threw her arms around him. “I’m so glad you’re ok.” She whispered.
</p>
<p>
	Stoker was going toe to weird giant insect leg with the Technomancer, trading blow for blow. Atlas was damaging him, denting his metallic frame until the undead thing’s cloak wrapped around Stoker and pulled him away to join the other crew. “Damn you, sheet of wrapping!” He yelled.
</p>
<p>
	“Chuddly, why?” The Technomancer said, hurt, as he skewered two skeletal ex-thralls and took a hit on the head from a mop.
</p>
<p>
	“You banished me to live in an Outhouse, you sociopath!” Chuddly yelled, clocking his former master around the head with an old cleaning bucket. “We’re all so sick of your mood swings, and your endless whistling, and making us watch your goddamn moonwalking attempts - you’re never going to get it!”
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer fell to the floor, his head in his hands as the ex-thralls dogpiled him. “All I wanted was acceptance - I mean that and the entire Omniverse under my control, obviously - and you all spurned me!.” He threw them off in a wave of anger, and raised glowing hands. “I’ll raise my entire army of the dead to destroy you all.” As he lifted his arms, thousands of his dead thralls rose from the ground, too many to even count. There was Stinky Bob, and Geldon Highwind the Elf of a thousand blades, and Shelly the tavern wench, and one-eared Doug, and little Timmy Blackcrest’s friends who died in the mines all those episodes ago. Yeah, remember that? That child slaughtering felt like a while ago, huh? “You’ll rue the day I ever raised you…oh wait. Why raise you all when I can just do this?”
</p>
<p>
	He clicked his fingers and all the thralls, obedient and rebel, lost their lustre and returned to the earth from whence they came, their lifeforce ebbing from them. “Oh, Fiddlefarts!” Said Chuddly, as a xylophone sounded a descending scale and he fell to a pile of dusty bones and was swallowed by the ground.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh yeah, I suppose I should have seen that coming.” Lionel muttered and unholstered the pistols that once belonged to Emmeth Graves. He ran at the Technomancer, shooting at his eyes as he did and screaming obscenities too harsh to print here. Worse than the C-word, even worse than Duxant. The Technomancer grabbed his face as his eyes bled, muttering something about having to book an eye test now. As soon as Lionel ran out of charges, the Technomancer pounced, pinning Lionel to the floor by the throat and dripping a dull green drool from his mouth as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
	“I’ve been looking forward to killing you most of all, you worthless little speck.” He hissed.
</p>
<p>
	Hijoki looked around from his position on Tamia’s hand. She was in bad shape, the concussion making her awake but in no way lucid. Blotch still struggled with stemming her leak, and Heath was deactivated. Stoker was trying to free himself from the cloak. Grissom was dying slowly, his lungs punctured, and Taber and Ludwig were unconscious in the treeline where they had landed. This was it. Hijoki kissed Tamia on the head. “You were the best thing that ever happened to me, kiddo.”
</p>
<p>
	A blue-faced Lionel reached around with his hands for something to use as a weapon, only to find the Technomancers towel. He grabbed it and flicked his attacker in the happysack with the best towel whip the Omniverse had ever produced. It pierced the air like a fart at a funeral and made everyone surrounding them wince in empathy. With a squeal reserved for baby birds calling for their mother, the Technomancer shrank back in agony.
</p>
<p>
	“Hey man, you sculpted junk for yourself, you get everything that goes with it.” Lionel smirked, clutching his neck.
</p>
<p>
	The crouching Technomancer shakily drew his hand back and set it aflame with an ethereal black fire. “I’ll burn you to ashes and use you to feed the stinkiest weeds in all Ithia, then I’ll pull you out by the roots and burn and smoke you. Every iota of life you have will cease, and I’ll win.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel closed his eyes as the Technomancer released the flame ball at him, but suddenly Hijoki was there. The blast hit him dead on, Hijoki burning as he intercepted the shot meant for his friend. He was incinerated in an instant which felt to Lionel like slow motion, and his remains fell in scraps of cotton and button eyes to the dusty floor. The last Lord of the Photonic Blades fell silent with a smile, knowing he had saved his friend.
</p>
<p>
	“No!” Tamia screamed and jumped at the Technomancer, raining slashes from the katana down on him. Lionel was there too, blinking tears as he kept on towel whipping the Technomancer’s swollen privates. The Technomancer grabbed them both, pushing them away before Stoker pulled a dead tree from the ground and flew straight at the wraith. As the tree trunk splintered and ran the Technomancer through, he reached for Stoker and pulled, severing the giant’s wings and sending him to the floor in agony. Phasing back through the tree, completely undamaged, he raised his grinning face to the sky. “You see, Malcolm, I am inexorable, predestined, fated!”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re showing ‘em, good buddy.” Malcolm said, peeing up against the discarded tree trunk. “Damn other imaginary dogs trying to mark my territory.”
</p>
<p>
	The sky above crackled loudly with static and turned orange as Taber and Ludwig began to stir. Small holes appeared in the grey, dead atmosphere and Taber nudged the struggling Grissom. “Fucking knew it.” He said.
</p>
<p>
	Hundreds of portals popped open and deposited thousands of Doots, Lionels, Grissoms, and the rest of the reinforcements. There was a cyborg Heath with thick bottle rim glasses, a transgender, blue-skinned, alien Lionel, a giant Grissom made of orange rock, a Tamia who had robotic slicing arms, a Taber made of stretchy taffy, a wind up toy Ludwig, a giant mech Blotch with a tiny pilot frog inside, a dinosaur in sunglasses and a leather jacket…there were so many of them, Infinite possibilities, infinite variations, all united with one thing in mind: stopping the Technomancer. He clicked his fingers again to raise his armies, skeletal arms forcing themselves from the dirt with renewed vigour and stench. His rage was such that even the TITSAG members were now under his spell again. The two forces held fast, eyeing the other up for what felt like an eternity before they started marching, then jogging, then running full pelt at each other. The sound when they smashed together around them was like nothing anyuniverse had ever heard.

	Mookie flew down from a portal, scanning the battlefield for someone they knew. They landed and picked Lionel up off the floor with relief at his pounding heart. The first thing Lionel did was fall into his friend's arms, crying.
</p>
<p>
	“Mookie, it’s Heath and Hijoki. They’re gone.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie looked over to Tamia in shock, as she stood dusting herself off. “I’m not ok, so don’t ask. He took my father and my friend from me. All I want is to take everything in return.” She ignited the blade, casting a furious face in red.
</p>
<p>
	Doots appeared next to Tam. “I’m sorry, it took us too long. We thought the best way to fight fire was with an equal sized but diametrically opposite fire.” She gestured to all the other shining Doots’ surrounding them.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s not just that, Doots.” Lionel said. “Proximity to you guys makes him weaker. He’s still badly ill from absorbing Ellie.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots looked at Mookie. This was it, her reason for being here, her very reason to exist. She turned and watched as all the other Doots gained the same idea and stared at her in recognition and agreement, as if someone had pushed a switch in their brains.
</p>
<p>
	Mookie was slower on the uptake, but realised what that meant. Mookie looked up to try and talk her out of it, the multitude of Doots were already charging towards their target. As Doots played ‘Born to Run’ on her keytar, she hopped on one of the notes, riding it towards the Technomancer. The other variants hopped aboard the trailing notes as one and followed Doots to battle.
</p>

	Blotch stood and released her hand. Finally, the acid had stopped flowing and her shell had sealed around the cudgel, which she had used to stem the flow. She now had a badass cudgel as her hand, pleased by how many people that would make piss their pants. She looked down at herself, she had lost a lot of her internal mass, and was now uncomfortably skinnier than she was. She resolved when this was done that she would drink and eat until she was back to full Blotchness.
</p>
<p>
	“God’s lass, it be good to see ya!” a voice came from behind, green arms wrapping around her waist before she knew what was happening. Green, wet, warty arms. She turned around to find Bar’Thur staring up at her, crying.
</p>
<p>
	“How?” Was all she could mutter.
</p>
<p>
	“I could ask the same.” He replied with a smile. “My Blotch died with Hallie before we left Ithia. I’ve been a mess without ya kid.”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch and Bar’Thur turned to throw a synchronised punch at an advancing Thrall as it jumped at them. “Finish this over a beer later, we got scumbags to rekill.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Grissom and Ludwig joined Tamia, Mookie and Lionel, Graves wearing Taber as a vest that was holding his insides together. They were a blur of movement amongst their Omniverse peers, putting down the dead with a fury they had been holding back for as long as they could remember.
</p>
<p>
	The Doots variants arrived in a clearing, standing in front of the Technomancer. “You think you can take me?” He sneered. “I am all, everything evil at the end of everything.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots smiled. She was at peace, the most serene and at ease she had felt. This was it, he was beaten, she had seen this scene in her mind the moment Lionel had revealed his nugget of information to her, and now Doot’s other selves were with her, it felt more real than ever. “We know.” She whispered. “Go.”
</p>
<p>
	The hundreds of Doots variants attacked, ducking under the Technomancer’s flailing and rushing into him one by one as he tried in vain to stop them. Each one disappeared as they joined with him, blinking light as they did. The Technomancer struggled, coughing thick bile and falling down to one knee as each took a fraction of his power away from him. And as he was stripped away, his Thralls lost energy and wandered away, looking to reclaim their old lives. In the crowd, Chuddly woke up, shook his head and walked away, his fist in the air Breakfast Club style. Then, after only a few minutes, Doots and the Technomancer were the only ones left in the clearing, surrounded by the crew and their exhausted variants.
</p>
<p>
	“I just wanted to be accepted. Why is that so hard for you all to understand?” The Technomancer sneered as he stood on shaking legs, bleeding from his mouth and eyes. “I want to be one of you.”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re not capable of being one of us, of having a personality, a soul.” Doots smiled. “You’re like one of those people who make death metal music or soap operas their whole personality. You’ve just picked despair. Those people are unhappy vessels, desperately pouring whatever they can into the temporary hole in their beings, but you’re even worse. Because at least they have glimpses of happiness, or can change. You’re just a worthless prick who was born worthless at the start of the entire Omniverse, and you’ll die worthless when the Omniverse dies. You’re literally nothing. And nature abhors a vacuum.”
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer stumbled back, clutching his heart. He looked over at Malcolm who just shook his head at him in disgust. He lunged at Doots, weakened and crying. “You think I’ll let you in? I’d rather exist as a weakened puddle of my former self than be nothing.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie stepped between them and put her forelegs to the Technomancer’s face. “Let me show you your future.” She poured everything she could, a vision of a world without the Technomancer, where people could continue to live and love how they saw fit, without fear and doubt, every piece of hope for the future she had, burning her powers and cauterising them. The Technomancer saw a million universes growing beyond their potential, and him finally at peace. No despair, no rage, no want.
</p>
<p>
	He fell back to his knees, then looked up at Doots with tears in his eyes. “Please. Do it. Free me.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots grabbed Mookie and kissed them. “I’ll always love you.” She whispered, then looked back at her friends. “All of you.”
</p>
<p>
	She walked towards the Technomancer, who looked up at her like a child seeking comfort. Doots looked back one last time at Mookie. “I’ll find you next time around. On the day you die, I’ll be the bright light at the end waiting for you.” She stepped into The Technomancer with a flash of light, and after a convulsion, he fell to the floor with a smile on his chrome mouth. He was still.
</p>
<p>
	Mookie didn’t even try to blink back their tears and turned to Grissom. “We need Heath.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	The process was simple, and the Technomancer’s programme was transferred into the deactivated Heath instantly. He woke, sitting up with a start. “Did I miss someth…” He twitched. “Ah, I see I did. You cancelled his powers out, used Doots to render him a balanced equation.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom smiled. “What else can fight all the sorrow in the universe but all the hope?” He patted Mookie on the shoulder, and they reached up to grab Grissom’s hand.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s what she was meant for.” Mookie sniffed.
</p>
<p>
	“I have them both in me now?” Heath whispered.
</p>
<p>
	“Was the only way, dear boy. You were too far gone, and we needed something strong to contain them.” Ludwig put a hand on Heath’s shoulder as Taber helped him to his feet.
</p>
<p>
	“I understand.” Heath considered. “I feel unending hope…and crushing sorrow.”
</p>
<p>
	“Makes sense.” Taber said low before clearing his throat. He gestured to the thousands of variants behind them, all simultaneously mourning the losses of their own Doots and celebrating the victory over the Technomancer. “We need to send these guys home, we haven’t got the room in the Swiftfeather, and I don’t want to meet my variants, I feel like we wouldn’t get on.”
</p>
<p>
	“If I know all those Blotches, we’d need more beer than this reality has.” Blotch chuckled.
</p>
<p>
	“What do we do?” Lionel asked, unsure. “ Where do we go now?”
</p>
<p>
	Tamia slipped the hand that usually sat inside Hijoki into Lionel’s. It smelled pretty bad, but Lionel was gentleman enough not to point that out and squeezed it back. “Wherever we want, Lionel.” she smiled.
</p>
<p>
	SEVEN YEARS LATER
</p>
<p>
	Lionel sat on the grassy bank, as the sun rose over the horizon and highlighted the lines around his eyes. He sighed deeply.
