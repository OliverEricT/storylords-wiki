<p>
	The Technomancer sat ill at ease on his throne of skulls. Most of the skulls were real but when they’d started building the thing, he had been forced to send Cyborg Steve down to HobblinLobby to get some craft materials and they’d had to spend a day together making Papier-mache skulls to finish the throne off. He swore to himself back then that he’d replace the skulls with real ones eventually, but he knew he was too lazy and old to do that now. Plus it would’ve hurt Steve’s feelings if he had thrown away their hard work, and Steve had spent the whole five hours they had spent crafting talking about his dead wife and kids that the Techomancer had probably killed to make his skull chair, so he wondered how far he could push it.
</p>
<p>
	It had been a trying couple of centuries for the Technomancer, fighting a war across the galaxy. Even keeping track of all he had done had given him a migraine. He got up from the throne, the papier mache squeaking as he did, and stepped over to his whiteboard. He picked a post-it note off the board marked, “Destruction of the Dukes of Lead” and sighed before scrunching it and dropping it to the floor, where one of the small Roombas he held under his thrall sucked it up.
</p>
<p>
	“Morning Master!” came a childlike voice behind him. Count Chundel came stomping in, his footfalls shaking the TechnoTower ™ to the foundations. He was once a humanoid man, but years of experimentation had significantly increased his muscle mass, at the cost of his brain.
</p>
<p>
	“Chundel, we have talked about this. Tippy toes and inside voice in the TechnoTower ™.” Technomancer shook his head, you just couldn’t technologically inhabit and enthral the dead staff these days.
</p>
<p>
	“Sorry, my lordliness of evil and all things terrifying in all the uni…”
</p>
<p>
	“You know, most days I lap this up, Chundel, but I’m having a bit of a crisis today, so let’s just skip all the bootlickery for now.”He rubbed his chin with a bony chrome finger, scratching at what he thought was a zit, before realising it was just a rivet.
</p>
<p>
	“I take it the mission was a success?” Chundel smiled broadly. “You must be glad to have gotten rid of all that paper?”
</p>
<p>
	It was at this point the Technomancer realised he should have given Chundel and his other generals at least some autonomous thinking parameters, in order for them to accurately process nuance. He sighed. “Yes, Chundel. My long war is at an end. With the death of the cyborg Achong Gunde, the last Duke of Lead is now gone. Now every corner of the universe is either under my control or without suitable resistance.”
</p>
<p>
	As the Technomancer said the words, he realised the real problem - he was bored. It was time to refresh.
</p>
<p>
	“That’s great, Master.” Chundel smiled. “The lack of battle has meant that I’ve had the time to take up new hobbies. I made you this…” Chundel pulled a misshapen crocheted hat from behind his back and pulled it onto Technomancer’s head, instantly ripping it as it got caught on one of the ram horns on the side of his helm. After he put it on he stepped back to assess his work and smiled. “You look great!”
</p>
<p>
	“I look like a sinister teapot. Thank you, Chundel.” The Technomancer strode past him, eager to get away to avoid having to turn him into scrap, but hovered in the door before he left. “Do you know where my son is today?”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Heath sat cross limbed in the secure mainframe stacks, his eyes rolled back in his head. He had been told many times that his way of absorbing information was ‘creepy and weird’ but he couldn’t find the protocol to care. He simply had to absorb all this data before his father found out. There was too much to learn, and the Technomancer hated sharing knowledge.
</p>
<p>
	He was currently plugged into the history databanks, learning about his father’s decimation of Ithea, his expert strategies that had given him his first army. Although honest to goodness, the entries were so self-indulgent for a technological being. If the information was a sound file it probably would have been accompanied by a full marching band.
</p>
<p>
	Since his creation by the Technomancer, Heath had devoted all runtime possible to the accumulation of knowledge. He did not understand his father’s methodology of bringing order to all life, but then he wasn’t designed to understand much of anything, outside of obeying. That is precisely why he had so many questions. His Shakespearean flaw, he supposed.
</p>
<p>
	“Master, he comes.”
</p>
<p>
	Heath’s eyes rolled forward like the reels on a slot machine, until the terrified face of Manservant 107 came into focus. He knew the look, knew what the words meant - the Technomancer had arrived. Heath disconnected from the private files and opened a file hisd father had written called ‘The Bar-Chart of the Deal’.
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer rounded the doorway with a look of fury, and a flourish of his tattered cape. Always one for a touch of overdramatisation. “Heath, why are you in my private archives? You have been told about these transgressions. And, uh... If you find a folder marked ‘Incredibly private.DO NOT OPEN.’ please don’t open it. It has Christmas lists and, uhhh, my diary…yes that will do…”
</p>
<p>
	“The Master was just…” 107 began, before the Technomancer cracked him across the face with a backhand, sending him hurtling into the memory banks. Heath stood to defend his friend, but 107 held a hand up.
</p>
<p>
	“Do not presume to tell me anything, carbon-based mistake.” The Technomancer sneered. “Worthier detritus than you has been wiped from the toilet bowls of history.”
</p>
<p>
	“What do you require, Father?” Heath wanted the spotlight, the accusation, the anger focused on him.
</p>
<p>
	That chrome skull turned towards Heath, and it still stirred an uneasiness in him, as it had in his early years. The visage of death, the disapproving hollow eyes, the lack of compassion - the plain freakiness of a chrome, horned skull staring at you.
</p>
<p>
	“The banquet is in four hours, and you are unprepared. Your ceremonial robes are undonned, your shell unclean, your power source not fully charged. You should be attending to these things, not indulging your snooping curiosity.”
</p>
<p>
	“Father, I…”
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer wrapped a hand around his son’s throat. Though old, the strength he drew from his thralls was still considerable. “I do not have to spare you the luxury of indulgence. I need you to be ready. You are mine, act as such. And never let me see you in here again.”
</p>
<p>
	With that he was gone, his cape flowing behind him, but that wasn’t surprising as he’d turned on the turbines that were integrated into his back to give him gravitas.
</p>
<p>
	Heath immediately ran over to 107, his steps sounding like Robocop because he had altered his servos back in his teens and still thought it sounded cool. 107 took his outstretched hand and rose to his feet, wiping blood from his mouth.
</p>
<p>
	“He was wrong to…” Heath began.
</p>
<p>
	“...subjugate every single life in the universe? Wipe every culture and everything of significance away? Art, expression, even that picture of the dogs playing poker?” His mouth twisted in a pained expression, trying to stop himself but failing. “Treating his son like a possession?”
</p>
<p>
	Heath watched 107, the despair on his face plain. It was understandable in many ways, but couldn’t he see that the Technomancer was trying to bring order to an unordered galaxy? “My father desires to assist, to help bring balance and parity.”
</p>
<p>
	107 laughed, though there was no humour in it. “That sure was a balanced backhand he gave me.”
</p>
<p>
	Heath turned away, busied himself with putting away the things he had brought to the mainframe. “You…you are my friend, 107. I respect your right to live and I try to treat you like an equal when I can. But your job is as valet to me. You are overreaching, your place in the order of things…”
</p>
<p>
	Heath strode to Heath and pushed the books away from him, slamming them down on the table. “Should not be set! And who is deciding this ‘order’? Do you ever ask yourself if it’s ethical that the person at the top has made himself the authority on all things?”
</p>
<p>
	Heath turned away. “You should leave me now. I am not finding this conversation conducive to an organised calm.”
</p>
<p>
	107 turned and left. “When there’s no one left but him, it’ll be as organised a calm as you can hope for.”
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	It was cold in the catacombs of Technotower ™, but luckily the last remnants of Dwarven flesh that had once covered Timmy Blackcrest’s body had log ago rotted and flayed away. Apart from the internal organs that beat within his metal shell, he was all machine now. And yet he felt the cold, and wondered if it wasn’t so much the temperature as the hate that poured from his prisoner, a hate that was frigid and deadly. As he approached the cell, a glow began to emanate from the room; she was awake. He hesitated, something about the being’s unclassifiable nature had always caused him to evaluate his next move carefully.
</p>
<p>
	“I know, you’re there, Timmy Blackcrest. Or are you more of Eden the rogue AI today?” A voice came to greet him, and he screwed his courage to the sticking place in his central core and entered the room.
</p>
<p>
	“I am the Technomancer, the doom of all that is.” He declared.
</p>
<p>
	“Ah, you’re the scared Dwarven child today. I see.” Doots Bardley sat behind a dampening field, her decades of solitary confinement doing nothing to dampen her radiance. She sat on her corner cot, not looking at her tormentor.
</p>
<p>
	“I have come to tell you that this game of ours ends today. I am transferring.”
</p>
<p>
	“You finally going to stop being a D-Bag?” She still refused to look at him, the annoying little glowworm, instead she stared off at an air vent behind him, hoping to irritate him. “Little too late for that boner-face, you slaughtered or stomped half the life in the galaxy.”
</p>
<p>
	“Including your friends.” He grinned.
</p>
<p>
	Doots turned to him, her face brightening. “You wanna rile me, get some satisfaction out of me, but it won’t play that way. My friends live on happily in countless other realities you can’t hope to touch.” She closed her eyes, as if to watch them in her mind's eye. “There’s a reality where Lionel and Ellie make small robot babies, where Hallie Swiftfeather leads glorious battle against you, or where Mookie…” She stopped, emotion getting the better of her. He remembered the Omniseer, how they had refused to let their powers be taken, so he had pulled their wings from her body and burned it to ash.
</p>
<p>
	“This reality is done, Bardsley. Order prevails. And tonight, when my body is new and my spirit reborn, I will have exactly what I need to make you do what I want, something I have been working on for nearly a century.” He reached into his cloak and pulled out a shard of pure energy that crackled and glowed, holding it in front of her. There was no need to explain what it was, her shocked face already knew, and in that look she confirmed his reasoning. This key would not only allow his transference, it would let him to absorb the Nexus and all her powers, and in turn reach into every single reality and bring order to all. The macro-cosmos would bend before him like reeds in a river of rage. He would kill the very idea of the Dukes of Lead, he would destroy the Mothman Prophesiers before they were conceived, he would slaughter Tamia Santo’s entire ancestral line, and he would spend a long time in that reality where the McRib was a permanent menu item. He placed the energy key on the table in front of her cell and gave her one last smirk. “See you again tomorrow. Don’t worry if you don’t initially recognise me in my new body, I’ll be the one standing over you and removing you from existence.”
</p>
<p>
	He left, smirking to himself.
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	“He’s gone now.” Doots spoke to the vent in the wall.
</p>
<p>
	Creaking metal released from the channel in the wall and the vent cover fell to the floor in a crash. A muck covered humanoid backed out of the duct and lowered himself to the floor, then tried to brush the dust from him, but it was no good, 107’s servant smock was grime stained. “I heard everything. What’s our next step?”
</p>
<p>
	“Next step?” Doots exclaimed. “The same step that has always been there waiting for you to climb it! Kill Heath. That way that Techno-Twat can’t transfer, can’t absorb my powers and can’t doom every single morsel of life in the Macro-Cosmos.”
</p>
<p>
	107 shook his head, scrabbling for reason. “I’ve been trying to teach him, to convince Heath that…”
</p>
<p>
	“Do you know what Heath means in Dwarven, 107?” Doots stepped forward to the dampening field, as close as she could muster, hoping proximity would make him hear better. “It’s derived from Heng, meaning halfling in Dwarven. His name literally means ‘half empty’. Heath was built to be a vessel, he needs something poured into him to be whole. You cannot…you don’t have the capacity to change his opinion of his father. He will not help us in his current state.” She sighed, so annoyed at the constant need to have this conversation. “Have you heard from the last resistance cell?”
</p>
<p>
	107 hung his head. “Achong Gunde and the last of the New Dukes of Lead were wiped out this morning, they’re not coming. He laid a trap and slaughtered them all.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots took a deep breath - it was all she could do to stop herself from collapsing. “Then it’s time, 107. We stop him, or existence is forfeit.”
</p>
<p>
	107 looked up, his face half lit by the key floating just above the table. And Doots realised what he was planning a fraction before he realised. As she sounded a protest, as she pointed out what this course of action might mean, he had scooped up the key and scurried back into the vent.
</p>
<p>
	After he was out of sight, she smiled. It was finally happening. She took a piece of paper from her pocket and unfolded it. On it was a rubbing of the message Mookie had scratched onto her keytar axe nearly 200 years ago. She missed her friend, and she kissed the piece of paper tenderly and knew that they would be together again soon.
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	Heath sat cross legged in his bedroom, staring at the robes his father had prepared for him. The day’s events weighed heavily on his mind, even more so than Fermat’s unsolved theorem or why Lost had ended in such a disappointing fashion, both things he had devoted significant runtime to since his creation. The way in which his father had reacted to his being in the mainframes had been expected, but his brutality had been unsettling, even for him, the man who had once created a giant foosball table out of real humanoids.
</p>
<p>
	He pulled on his robe and went to the charging station, then plugged himself into the cradle…and stopped. He should recharge, he knew he should, he had been ordered to. But something nagged at him, a splinter in his programming. The files he had taken from the mainframe still sat in his downloads folder, along with some very questionable video files of USBs being suggestively plugged into stuff marked ‘Christmas list’. Searching the registry, he found the first recorded file and opened it.
</p>
<p>
	A flood of information assailed his processors, of a grief-ridden dwarven child’s pact with a murderous artificial intelligence - sorrow and cruelty mixing to create something truly terrible. A cycle of sorrow, the abused growing into abuser, with no end in sight. His father was a tyrant, a perpetual force of despair.
</p>
<p>
	Gasping though he didn’t need to breath, shaking though he didn’t have muscles, sick though he had no stomach, he forced himself back into reality. 107 stood over him, offering a helping hand. Heath took it and brought himself to his feet. “I thought I had burned a bridge with you, 107.”
</p>
<p>
	“My real name is Aaron.” He smiled. “At least it was before I was given a number. We’re friends for now Heath, don’t worry. But I need your help if we’re going to stay that way.”
</p>
<p>
	“I cannot rebel against the Technomancer, Aaron. I do not possess the ability to process the hatred needed for him. I think in binary - 1 or 0, soup or salad, tea or all other inferior beverages.”
</p>
<p>
	Aaron hung his head. “Then she was right.”
</p>
<p>
	“What do you mea…?” Heath began, but was overcome with telemetry from his midsection. As he looked down, Aaron had stabbed him in the stomach with what looked like a shard of energy, his hand still wrapped around it. As Heath fell, Aaron joined him, both of them losing consciousness together.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	The assembly for the banquet had arrived, the Technomancer’s generals arriving early as all true villains do. There was Kid Hitler, the reincarnated head of the 14th Reich who sat in his stroller attended by his assassin nanny, The Kindersitter. Next to him in deep conversation with the lord of the deep, Baron Bass, was Lord Nigel the Aristo-Tyrant, polishing his deathray monocle as he laughed with the Baron about the sacking of the lesser planets of the outer worlds.
</p>
<p>
	Frankie Fourfeathers, the mafia parrot was regaling Lasorfist with a story about poisoning a city's water supplies when The Scarlet Cape skipped over to correct a grammatical error in his story and everything nearly kicked off.
</p>
<p>
	In one corner of the room, the techno-witch JK Rowling was talking to Gerald Jele-Skeleman, laying out her plans for a world without trans people, leading Gerald to make a gesture to the guards and get her ejected from the banquet. Everyone cheered. There’s villainy, and then there’s JK Rowling, and these people had an image to maintain.
</p>
<p>
	Dave-who-dressed-like-a-pirate-but-wasn’t-actually-a-villain-with-any-sort-of-maritime-theme, the Grey Woman - who was listening to Radiohead and sobbing, - and the Rhyme Killer - who made beats so violent your future kids felt them - were all sat at the table making angry eyes at each other. They may all have been Technomancer lieutenants, but they were still distrusting and selfish, especially when it came to who got the biggest portions at dinner. Also the Commissioner of the LAPD was there, because ACAB.
</p>
<p>
	As the dinner bell sounded, all the participants rushed to the table and an ominous hush fell upon the gathering. Cyborg Steve came from the open hallway, and announced the arrival of the Technomancer, throwing a smoke bomb to the floor. But he’d miscalculated the fuse length, and when the Technomancer awkwardly poked his head around the doorway to ask if something had gone wrong, the bomb exploded and gave him a facefull of fog. Technomancer coughed and spluttered his way to the table, using his cape to fan his face. When he regained his composure, he lifted a glass.
</p>
<p>
	“My subordinates. I’ve gathered you all here...cough…good god Cyborg Steve, what did you put in that smoke bomb? It tastes like a fire demon took a dump in my mouth.” He cleared his throat and recommenced his speech. “You’re all here for a very special event. Now this reality is finally ours, it’s time for my son…”
</p>
<p>
	He looked over to where Heath should be sat only to find JK Rowling had snuck her way back in. After she had been ejected via a high window, he called for Steve. “Where is my son?!” he demanded through gritted teeth.
</p>
<p>
	The level four alarms sounded, alarms reserved for imminent attack, cold callers, when people said ‘supposably’, or a prison break. Technomancer marched out of the room and up the west tower to his son’s rooms, leaving a bemused set of guests wondering if they would ever get to eat.
</p>
<p>
	As the Technomancer tore the door to the room off its hinges, he saw two things, his son’s human manservant lying dead upon the floor, and his energy transference key, drained of all its energy next to him. Rushing to the body, he noticed that the humanoid was not just dead, but had no lifeforce, memory, neurochemical reaction. He had been drained.
</p>
<p>
	“Bardsly.” He muttered, eyes murderous.
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	“What is your plan, do you even have one?” Doots said as she was carried up and out to the battlements of Technotower ™ in Heath’s arms. It was raining in sheets of water, soaking them both through. Doots hadn’t felt the rain for decades, it was glorious.
</p>
<p>
	“I do not know, these feelings of rebelliousness are quite new to me. 107 couldn’t have planned for my feeling so anxious and desperate, could he?” Heath was like a lost child, seeing the world for the first time. Doots smiled, he reminded her of a certain friend of hers.
</p>
<p>
	“I dunno, I think that’s exactly what he had planned when he transferred his lifeforce to you.”  She smirked.
</p>
<p>
	They stopped suddenly, and before she could ask why, Doots noticed the army of degenerates at the end of the walkway between Technotower ™ and the front barbican (ding ding - fact of the day, the building carrying a portcullis and drawbridge is called a barbican This is where the ‘The More you know Star would fly by if we had a VFX budget). As Heath turned in panic, an army stood behind them too, the Technomancer at the head of the pack.
</p>
<p>
	“I’d say I didn’t know what possessed you, but I know all too well. That key was meant to give you power.” He shouted through the rain, glaring at Doots.
</p>
<p>
	Heath lowered Doots to the ground behind him, and protected her with his frame. “That power you speak of was at the cost of all I am.”
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer took a step forward, the army at the rear closing in as well. “Irrelevant. You were created to be a vessel and nothing more. You are mine. There’s nowhere to go, Heath.”
</p>
<p>
	“I wouldn’t say that.” Doots drew a circle with a finger on the floor beside her, the shape cracking in sparks as she did.
</p>
<p>
	“Stop her!” the Technomancer screamed, his fury a balm to her years of torture.
</p>
<p>
	As the portal between worlds opened, and laserfire flew towards them, Doots grabbed Heath and threw him downwards, pushing something into his hands. “Find them all. Tell my friends I…”
</p>
<p>
	A laser blast ripped through Doots at the midsection, her eyes widening temporarily in shock before a smile crept across her lips. Her golden light faded as her body crumpled to the ground and Heath reached for her, feeling a desperation loss he could not explain. As the light left her eyes, the portal closed behind Heath to the sound of the Technomancer’s frustrated cries, and he was plunged into nothingness.
</p>
<p>
	******
</p>
<p>
	Heath woke to the sound of buzzing and birdsong, and forced himself to a sitting position. If his internal temperature gauge was anything to go by, this was a swamp, and a particularly humid one at that. He stood, eager to find out where he was, but didn’t recognise any of the local flora or fauna, and the frequency of ambient energies had changed.
</p>
<p>
	“What is it?” A deep guttural voice asked.
</p>
<p>
	Heath turned to see a band of travellers: A man sized frog batting a large, studded, hexagonal club into his open palm stood next to a Jeleskeleman of lurid orange consistency, her disconnected neon bones floating in her slime. Next to them hovered a bluish shimmer, which became a cloaking robe as the human woman threw it back to a spark of electricity and brandished a pair of repeating crossbows at him. Next to her was a woman with long ears in a ranger's armour, she held a sword and a shield and looked as furious as he’d ever seen anyone outside of his father. When she spoke, her voice was akin to crushed velvet, but there was an edge to it, clipped and suspicious.
</p>
<p>
	“Speak soft, stranger. You are either lost, or an agent of our prey.” She pulled the sword up.
</p>
<p>
	“I do not know where I am. What country is this?” Heath took a step forward, only for the sharp edge of an axe to press against his chin. There was someone behind him.
</p>
<p>
	“I dunno, General Swiftfeather, this one looks mighty shiny to me.” The voice was familiar, but he couldn’t put his finger on it.
</p>
<p>
	“Calm yourself, Doots.” Another voice came from behind him. “This isn’t the time for anger. Hallie needs us ready for anything.”
</p>
<p>
	Heath turned quickly, no thought of his neck against the blade. “Doots? I thought you’d died!” He embraced her, only for the band to draw their weapons at him. Doots’ companion, a giant moth creature, snatched the piece of paper from his hand and stared at it, before showing Doots. She looked shocked.
</p>
<p>
	“Where did you get this?” Doots demanded.
</p>
<p>
	“You gave it to me, before you pushed me through that portal.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots flipped the axe, which was in reality a musical instrument he had never seen before, on the reverse the message scratched there matched the one on the scrap of paper he had been given.
</p>
<p>
	“I can explain.” Heath muttered, before the frog man’s club knocked him into standby mode.
</p>
<p>
	TO BE CONTINUED!!!
</p>
