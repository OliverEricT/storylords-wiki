Episode 13 - Death by the Sharpest Cut

Prompts - Politicians and Ziggurats

Tamia swung her legs off the scrubfish and gave the beast’s scaly throat a stroke, before telling her she was such a good girl, patting her on the side, and sending her swimming back up to the surface. Tamia surveyed the structure in front of her, a giant metal statue of a cephalopod with rocky tentacles carved into the wall of the reef. She wanted to smugly ask Hijoki if he thought the intel they had sliced out of that Blue Raven chopshop manager was on the level now, but he wouldn’t hear her through the rebreather mask she was wearing or the plastic bag she had taped around her wrist to keep the possessed sock from drowning or smelling like a wet sock. So she stored the sass and instead approached the structure, trying to remember what the previously two-armed Blue Raven had told her.

She thought of her Father briefly - he was a xeno-technologist and would have loved to have seen this, some technorelic of a forgotten species that had some unbeknownst historical significance, like jncos, pogs, or simple human understanding and empathy. She banished the thought quickly, she didn’t like to think of her parents much. Ever since they had been spaced by the Blue Ravens when she was a kid, the act of thinking of them just reminded her of how alone she had been. At least, until Hijoki had bonded with her. She now liked to pretend that her parents weren’t gone, they just…existed somewhere else.

In the precise order she had been told, she fingered the octopus statue’s rings, before chuckling to herself like a schoolgirl. Hijoki shook his head from inside his plastic bag at her immaturity as the tentacles opened with an ancient groaning of rusted steel, revealing a small tunnel inside. She swam up it and breached the surface of the water beyond to find a small internal dock and a facility beyond. She felt Hijoki sigh, and released him from his plastic prison that some celebrities would pay money to be tied up in.

“This feels vaguely supervillainy.” Hijoki said.

“You always say that. You said that about that cute little library we visited on Faustus III.” Tamia smirked.

“You mean The Library of the Endless Pain? The one we had to fight our way out of with a date stamper because that slime devil threw your sword out of the window?”

“You worry too much, old man.” Hijoki smiled, pulling the rebreather away and replacing it with her fox mask as they entered the facility. “We have horrible battles all the time, we’re due an easy one.”

******

Approximately ten minutes later, Tamia swung for the fences, expecting the last security officer’s head to come flying off in one. But this guy was an absolute Beef Duke, with a neck as thick as a thot’s instagram account, and the laser katana stuck in his meaty head holder. And the guy…just…kept…coming. As in, he kept advancing, he didn’t have an ejaculation problem or anything.

“This last one sure is an easy one, huh? What are you going to do now?” Hijoki said at her wrist, the sock smug at her failing. He’d warned her to be more delicate with the blade, it was a tool for finesse, not bludgeoning.

The guy charged and swung at Tamia, who ducked easily, then kicked him in the back of the knee and drove him to the floor. “Maybe I can stuff your stinky mass in his mouth and suffocate him with your cheesiness?” Tamia grinned.

Beef Duke howled in pain and aimed a headbutt at her which she countered with a knee to the nose. His protuberant proboscis split, blue blood spraying across the room.  “Hey! I asked you a week ago if I smelled, and you said ‘no’!” Hijoki said, hurt.

Beef Duke threw a leg out  spartan style and caught Tamia in the gut, sending her across the room through a set of lab equipment and slamming her against the internal airlock. “Actually, if you remember, I said ‘not any more than usual’. Unfortunately your usual scent is ‘eau de dog turd and rotting flesh’ by Caca Chanel.”

“Hey are we fighting or not?” the Beef Duke said through his already swelling face, tired of their bickering.

“Well one of us is. The other is bumbling around like a zombie with the shits.” Hijoki smiled, prompting the man to charge at them.

“Thanks for that.” Tamia got to her feet. “Your valuable input is always appreciated, coach.”

As he came close, Hijoki punched the airlock control and Tamia somersaulted over the man, placing a hand on his back to push him into the small room. As he passed the open door, Hijoki pressed the button again, closing the airlock with Beefy inside. The internal pressure rose swiftly, and soon a very red faced Blue Raven was pounding on the window.

Hijoki turned to Tamia. “You ever wonder if these guys have family?” he said out of the side of his mouth.

“Nah. People this evil can’t possibly have people who love them.”

******

Four light years away, a cute seven year old clutched a picture of his burly, meat-necked father while he stared at the stars outside his bedroom window.

“Hey, little fella. You should be asleep.” His mother called from the doorway.

“I know momma, I just miss daddy. You think he’ll be back soon?”

“He’s due home next week, pumpkin.” The woman said. “Now time to tuck you in.”

She kissed his head and left him to his dreams, and the love of his father.

*******

“And if they do…then they shouldn’t have started working with murderers.” Tamia finished.

“I guess so. What about the sword? How are we going to ge…?” Hijoki asked.

Beef Duke’s melon burst under the pressure in the airlock, spraying the porthole with chunks of head. The laser sword deactivated and clattered to the floor. “Never mind.” Hijoki muttered.

EDITORS NOTE: You might be questioning if this is possible in an underwater airlock, but - a) This isn’t Earth, or even our reality, and b) Shut up, this is my story.

******

After retrieving the sword and wiping the chunks of neck beef off it, Tamia and Hijoki ascended the steps into a set of offices that were largely deserted. Offices, Tamia thought, Hijoki was right, true supervillainy lives here. On one wall a poster depicted a cat hanging off a branch, whilst another, more evil looking cat whipped it from a higher branch. The words below it read ‘Hang in there, Capitalists’.

Through a door at the end of the room, sounds of processing could be heard, so the pair followed the cacophony onto a service balcony overlooking a factory floor with a pool in the middle of the room. Small, squid-like creatures emerged from the pool with armfuls of rocks and placed them on conveyor belts where others of their kind broke the rocks apart to reveal small, black pearls that shone with an iridescent glow. When the pearls were revealed, they were placed back on the conveyor and sent through an orange portal at the end of the line.

“What are they doing?” Hijoki whispered and they crouched at the railing, watching this incredibly machine-like production. “What are those things?”

“Whatever it is, if the Blue Ravens and the Technomancer are involved, ole pointy here will have something to say about it.”

“Ol’ pointy? That’s a four thousand year old ceremonial sword, Tamia!”

“So you mean I shouldn’t be cutting my toenails with it then?” Tamia smiled. “ Shall we go make calamari out of these fools?”

“I feel that’s xenophobic at best, but yes.”

Tamia vaulted over the railing and landed into a roll, because those superhero landings would never work and your knees would be shot after five landings. She pulled the sword from its scabbard and ignited it, casting a red glare across her face as if she’d just butchered the Kool-Aid man. Taking a step towards the squid, her gaze fell to their lower tentacles which were manacled together. A long line of chained squid looked up at her in fear, then cowered together in a group, their chains clinking against the floor. Tamia’s mouth opened in horror. “They’re slave labour, Hijoki.”

Hundreds of eyes stared up at them, and Tamia switched the sword off.

“Achem, excuse me dear lady.” An oddly formal voice spoke from behind her. And as they turned, a diminutive squid in a small green waistcoat came wriggling towards them on four tentacles. His beard - such as it was - was also made of small tentacles, and he was slightly more red in colour than the prisoners. “Ah noticed you have disrupted pro-duction, and wanted to enquire as to whether you were this ‘Crimson Fox and Sock’ pair ah had heard so very much about on the kelpvine.”

Tamia ignited the sword and pointed it at the Squid. “Are you responsible for this?” Asked Hijoki.

“Responsible is such a…complicated explanatio…”

Tamia grabbed the squid around the throat with Hijoki and pushed him against the wall, raising the sword so close that the subtle smell of frying fish wafted under her nose. Hikoi choked and spluttered, his mouth full of Squid. “Make it less complicated.”

The squid explained. “Ah am the warden of this here hellhole, Ludwig the Squidlord. When the Coalition of Ordered Planets (editors note…ACAB, even in acronym form) came here, President Tippin was interested in Krakenite’s unfertilised offspring.”

Tamia sighed. “Caviar is delicious, but please don’t tell me it’s as simple as evil, rich people like fish eggs.”

“No, the exothermic reactions our discarded eggs produce as they break down run hotter than a shuttles drive core or a right wing brain when it’s trying to understand pronouns. The COP wanted to use them to power their fancy starships. But because Krakenite eggs are too dangerous to transport in high quantities, they let us mine them at our own pace, buying them from us…until they up and decided we were too slow. Then, they put your humble servant here in charge of my own people to make sure they work fast and for free. We’re all prisoners here, Miss Fox. Iffen I don’t help my people work, they’ll kill us all.”

“What changed?” Hijoki asked as Tamia let the squid to the ground. Hijoki spluttered and hacked. “Urgh, tastes like sushi.”

Ludwig looked over his shoulder, where a sturdy looking security door was locked with high security locks. A golden glow leaked from the cracks around the door and shone into the room. “Our generous benefactors found a better whip to subjugate us.”

Tamia pulled the mask down with a purpose and strode to the security door, the katana making short work of the electronic locks and shorter work of the hinges. The stench of burning metal and electronics almost too much. “Open sesame.” She said as she stepped back, letting the solid slab of metal fall to the floor with a deafening slam. Golden light flooded out, almost blinding them both. But it was Hijoki’s vision that returned first - probably because socks don’t have eyes - and when he spoke it was with a revelry Tamia hadn’t heard from him before.

“It’s beautiful.”

Tamia blinked away spots, until she saw what he had been referring to: a hooded, golden man sat next to the wall, plucking hologrammatic strings that seemed to connect to his robotic arms. He played the strings like a harp that produced a beautiful aria. When he looked up at his saviours, he stopped playing and the strings vanished, as did the portals at the end of the conveyors. Ludwig waddled over to the controls to stop the conveyors dumping explosive eggs all over the floor and killing them.

“Are you here to kill me, finally?” The man whispered.

“Save you, use you to kill a technomancer, maybe make out with you a bit.” Tamia had never seen anyone so beautiful, he was like the Angels of Tethin her father had told her stories about. “What’s your name?”

“Doots, Doots Bardly.” The creature said as he pushed himself off the floor and joined them. “And you?”

Hijoki rose up between them, eying the man like a protective father here to take his daughter to prom. “I’m Hijoki, and this is Tamia Santo.”

Ludwig came waddling up and placed a slimy tentacle on her arm. “Santo? As in Forex Santo?”

A dagger of ice pierced her heart and sapped all warmth from her. To hear her Father’s name after all this time. “That was my dad’s name. He died when I was a kid.”

“No.” Ludwig shook his head, his tentacle beard swishing back and forth. “He’s been forced to work for President Tippin too, just like the rest of us. I remember him coming to this facility years ago, back when the Coalition of Ordered Planets were still pretending they wanted to work with us. He was here to learn our culture, but was taken off the project when the President decided to subjugate us instead.”

Tamia’s arms shook, and if Hijoki hadn’t been controlling her other hand, the Katana would have clattered to the floor. She wanted to sob, break something, kill someone, laugh, hug Hijoki, tear him away from her, fuck, fight, eat a family size bag of tortillas (though that one wasn’t anything new). One thousand emotions ran through her head at the same time, and her brain threatened to shut down from the pressure. Her Father was still alive, after all these years a captive. As if sensing her pain, the captive Krakenites huddled and comforted one another with soothing, undulating song. Hijoki rose up to her and nuzzled against her neck. “What next, kid? Whatever you need to do, I’m with you.”

Tamia’s eyes burned holes in everyone around her before they settled on Ludwig the Squidlord. “Where?”

“Where else, mah dear? The White Ziggurat of course.”

*******

After Ludwig had freed his people from their shackles, and they had all gathered their things, Doots opened a portal as instructed. The Santo woman had given them all the chance to go, it was clear what she wanted to do to the ruling politicans that had destroyed her and the sock’s families. He could see an aura of blood red around her, the rage emanating in waves  that looked too hot to touch. After a decade in confinement, he knew he should run, find his friends and his wife, Mookie, and try to live free as long as he could. But. It felt preordained that he should meet these people, and given that Ludwig was going too, he felt he should protect the squid that had kept him fed, watered and stimulated with conversation for all these years in prison.

The portal opened in the Ziggurat itself, the seat of power for the Coalition of Ordered Planets. The four of them stepped through into a sub basement, the most likely area to find Santo’s missing Father, and the Squidlord brought a scanning device out of his belt.

“Handy guy to have around.” The sock puppet gestured to him. “Could’ve used him back in that swamp with those handsy bog monsters.”

“Hmmm.” Tamia grunted. Despite the woman’s efforts to rebuff him, the sock had tried to start a conversation with her on four occasions now. It was clear all she wanted to do was kill. As if he’d read Doots’ mind, the sock turned.

“She’s normally more fun than this, you’ve caught her on a trying day.”

“Odd.” Ludwig rubbed a beard tentacle with one of the others. “I’m not reading anyone from your race in this part of the facility. They must be keeping him prisoner somewhere else.”

“No.” Tamia almost growled. “Widen the search of this building.”

A sudden ping came from the scanner. Followed by a confused look from Ludwig. “He’s in the residential quarter.”

Doots pulled the harmonic strings from the electronic pads on his robotic fingers, and gestured with a questioning, raised eyebrow.

“Play on.” Tamia said without even a hint of happiness.

******

The room was dark, and why wouldn’t it be? They emerged in the early hours of the morning in a comfy suite, the soft sounds of sleeping breath in the air. Tamia strode to the bed and grabbed the man by the shoulders, ignoring what she assumed were words of warning from Hijoki.

Forex Santo opened his eyes slowly and studied the face in front of him in fear before he realised who she was. Then tears and a smile came to his face and as quickly as they appeared, she was enveloped in his arms and both of them were sobbing.

As his chin rested on her shoulders, she felt him tense up and then suddenly say, “You brought friends?”

Her father dressed quickly as he explained how he , his wife and Tamia had stowed away on a Photonic Blade Clan ship, looking to get as far from the COP as possible, when their transport had been attacked. He had feared them dead, and so threw himself into his work, later forced into work by the Coalition and their president Gily Tippin. At the completion of his tale, Forex looked confused as the others seemed to be prepping for confrontation, not extrication. Tamia held the hilt of her blade and was checking the connectors, whilst Ludwig pulled a smaller armoured waistcoat over his regular one. “Aren’t we leaving?”

“Nope.” Tamia felt Hijoki tense as he realised what she was thinking, but she thought to him to stay quiet. “We need to finish Tippin then the rest of the Quorum. Cut off the head and the snake briefly dies, before being replaced by a scalier snake. They all need to go.” She gave Ludwig a nod.

“But, we can get away, it’s not important.” Forex spluttered.

Forex seemed edgy as Ludwig gave him a small pellet. “Put it in your breast pocket, and when the time comes, slap it. It’ll transport you away lickety split should our altercating get too rambunctious for you.”

Forex obliged, and when Doots opened the portal into the Quorum Chambers they stepped through.

*******

Initially the room was quiet, but almost immediately the lights came on to reveal just what she expected. An amphitheatre set of seats, where a hundred or so alien species seemed to almost instantly come to life, shouting and disagreeing loudly.

“Where did they all come from?” Hijoki whispered, but she didn’t answer, instead she pushed through the crowd that didn’t seem to even register her existence, to the central floor below. The rest followed her. Tamia ignited the katana and stuck it in the ground to prise a floor panel loose. Underneath a sprawl of wires lay tangled.

“Want to stop this, or are you going to make me?” She announced as if to no one, hoping that she was wrong, but hoping she wasn’t.

When no one came forward, she plunged the sword into the wires, emitting a little sob that only Hijoki could hear as she did.

The room went dark, but for the luminescence provided by Doots and the blade, every single screaming politician vanished, the room suddenly silent.

“How did you know?” Forex asked, disappointment in his voice.

Tamia pulled the sword from the floor and held it menacingly, tears streaming freely now. “We found a slave in a suite in the highest office in the known universe. When you looked at me - when you woke up - it was disappointment in your eyes that I was there, not surprise. Lastly, when you recounted how you got to be here, you didn’t say anything about looking for us. You didn’t come looking for your wife and your child. Didn’t we matter at all to you, did you just assume we were dead…Technomancer?”

“Well this is awkward.” Her father straightened, and it seemed as if the burden of a lie lifting off his shoulders had made him grow two feet in height. “I didn’t assume anything, I just learned it didn't matter. Once I found him.” He pointed to Doots. “You are but one Tamia in a sea of available options, why cry about one?”

“The Clan of the Photonic Blade, The Krakenites, The Blue Ravens, The Coalition of Ordered Planets, that planet of Cats that think they’re people and they dress up in little suits, they’re all part of the same system. Oppression as status quo, hatred as a bottom line, control masquerading as uniqueness. The patterns reemerge every year on every world. We have fallen into entropy, a slow death as we circle the drain of existence, all slouching towards the inevitable cellular death of the biological and the heat death of the universe. Uneven players on an uneven playing field ”

“Nothing anyone can stop.” Ludwig raised an eyebrow, clearly impressed by the man’s level of insanity.

“Not true. When I found Doots here, President Tippin saw an opportunity for change, and I saw something else, an opportunity for something better, a hundred doors opening to a hundred different possibilities.  So I killed them all and set up this elaborate, but very expensive, intricate hoax. Somewhere in the infinite cosmos, they must have it right. Equality for all. A universe where I have a loving, non psychopathic daughter, and you a loving, caring father.”

Hijoki gasped. “You’re no Technomancer, you’re a crazy man…cer.”

“I can see how it would seem that way. Assuming a leader is on the top of the hill by nothing but privilege or fortune, but sometimes the person atop that hill is just the top predator, and that hill is a mound of corpses. I don’t like it, but I abused the system I hate in order to topple it.” Forex smiled and drew a device from his pocket. “Enough now.  Doots, you’ll open a portal or I will destroy Ludwig’s world.”

Doots shook his head. “You wouldn’t.” But already he had plucked the strings from his hands, knowing that Forex was serious.

“You’ll step through, I will follow and we will leave these numbers in the margin to lick their wounds.” Forex said.

It was almost too much to bear, like when Hjoki had killed his daughter to save them, or that time she’d said ‘you too’ to that waiter that served her at dinner. Her own father, her flesh and blood, saw her as nothing but a version of the perfect daughter he’d somehow be able to replace. She wondered when he’d written her off in his head? Had she spelled something wrong? Had it been some tantrum? Some tear she had shed?

She threw the sword at the portal without thinking, and as the energy partially crossed the threshold it cracked and fizzed, then splintered the portal like a broken mirror. Through the portal she could see at least a hundred fragments, a hundred worlds. Infinite possibilities. Right there.

Forex screamed in fury, clenching his fists until his knuckles whitened, before regaining his composure in true super villain style. He held the device in his hand intending to detonate it, until Ludwig reached into his armoured waistcoat and threw a small inky blue bead at Forex’s chest. The resulting reaction of the Krakenite egg with the one he had sneakily given him early created an explosion that ripped through Forex’s chest. He crumped, clutching at his damaged body, then fell through the portal.

“No!” Tamia shouted after him. And took a step to follow him into whatever craziness they could find.

“Wait.” Said the Squidlord rubbing his four tentacles together. “I would very much like to help kill that SOB.”

“Doots?” Hijoki asked.

But Doots shook his head. “I think you’ll find another me wherever you end up. I’ve got some cleaning up to do here, and a wife to see again.”

“You ready?” Tamia asked the pair, and at their nods, they held hands and jumped through together.

******

Tamia woke to the sound of gunfire, and a man clattering over her to fall in the mud next to Ludwig. She was lying in a bog.

“Get up you miserable sack of….” Came a gruff voice. A stocky cowboy looked down at her, his robotic hand holding a laser pistol. “ Well, well Lionel, looks like someone else is after that power core.”

A calamitous stirring of the undergrowth was heard, and two flying, cybernetic men crashed into the clearing. Tamia was to her feet in an instant - something instinctive told her to attack - and sliced the head clean off one of the things. The cowboy emptied a clip into the other until it’s buzzing and movement stopped.. When the dust had settled  The cowboy offered a hand, as ‘Lionel’, a thin, reedy young man who looked like he might pass out at any instant, helped Ludwig to his feet, well tentacles.

“Grissom Graves. This here’s Lionel” He growled.

“Tamia Santo, this is Ludwig Squidlord and this is my master, the Photonic Clan Chief, Hijoki.” She held up Hijoki, who bowed.

“Lionel I swear if you poisoned me again with those ‘burritees’ again…” The cowboy spun around to the younger man.

“It’s burritos, and I didn’t poison you, I told you you needed to peel the tinfoil off!” Lionel protested.

Above them in the atmosphere, coming from nowhere as if it crashed into existence with a popping of air, a large spaceship appeared. It looked like nothing any of them had ever seen.

“Well that’s about right for today.” Grissom said as he took another shot at the beetleman’s corpse for good measure.

******

Forex Santo crawled to the figure in the darkness, grabbing it’s heavy boot. “Help me…” he whispered, barely able to stay conscious.

The figure lifted him off the ground and brought him up to stare at him. Forex saw a terrifying hooded robot, it’s chainmail clinking against ram horns.

“Another one?” What value do you have, humanoid?” it spoke in electric fizzing.

“I…I am the Technomancer.” Forex quivered in fear.

“My friend, we are all Technomancers here.” A voice came from behind and as Forex turned he saw a monstrosity, a half human, half robotic nightmare that laughed in sounds he had never heard. In Timmy Blackcrest and Eden’s voice.  “Now let’s figure out what use you are.”

THE END….
