</p>
<p>
	It had been a month since the Waystation, where everyone had been temporarily placated by deep desires intent on killing them. Since Lionel had torn them away from their wants and needs. A month since the Technomancer had butchered his two fellow dickheads and taken their power for himself. A month since the Technomancer had stolen Ellie away. Coincidentally, it was white history month in the Tellarian sector, a holiday conceived when the most annoying white factions - overzealous snyderbros, gamergaters, cryptohawkers, Terfs, and the megafacist cannabalistic irradiated gangs of cockroach-men from post apocalyptic Neo Los Angeles that identified as white. Oh and the NYPD - getting my ACAB out early this week, bitches.
</p>
<p>
	In that last 42 days (who said it was a human month, don’t be so ethnocentric, people), Lionel had had a lot of terrible days. There was the day Blotch had nearly taken his head off with her cudgel when he had said good morning, the day Grissom had refused to get him a new toilet roll and just zipped up and left him in the stall with his trousers around his ankles, or when Doots and Mookie stopped conversations or Ludwig got up and left whenever he entered a room, or when he finally started watching the last season of Lost to figure out what all the fuss had been about and then realised it was going absolutely nowhere and meant absolutely nothing at all.
</p>
<p>
	But on the ranking of shit days that both simultaneously sucked and blew, on the floor of the Tarkalian Ring Diner (home of the double insectoid parasite burger, absorb it directly into your bloodstream in 40 seconds and it’s free and lethal), as a Harvester held him by the throat and brandished a spinning saw blade at him, this was at the top. Well, maybe second to the day he started Lost.
</p>
<p>
	“I can’t believe you fell for such an obvious fake distress call trap. How does it feel to be this close to death, Human?”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel considered. “To be honest, I won’t have to find out what happens between Jack and Kate now, so it’ll probably be a kindness.”
</p>
<p>
	The Harvester with the robotic jaw spun up the saw and pushed it towards Lionel’s neck. “I’m going to cut you a new mouth, funny man”
</p>
<p>
	Out of nowhere, Tamia flipped over the booth and slashed up through the saw blade arm, which flew skyward and embedded itself into the ceiling. As the Harvester cried in pain, she flung Hijoki out. The sock flew through the air laughing and into the Harvesters’ mouth, choking him to death. She pulled Hijoki from the dead cyborg’s mouth and turned to Lionel to help him to his feet.
</p>
<p>
	“Jeez, kid, if I’m more useful than you at killing Harvesters, there’s a problem here.” Hijoki chuckled.
</p>
<p>
	“I thought the distress signal might have been Ellie. Wait, what? I’m not that much of a burden am I?” Lionel frowned.
</p>
<p>
	“Ohhhh Lionel. Yeah.” Tamia put a hand to his cheek and beamed at him as another Technomancer charged at them. Tamia stomped on the floor and the embedded saw blade loosened and fell down straight into the Harvesters face, spraying them both with lashings of blood. The Harvester collapsed to the floor, dead. “But I don’t want you to think this is because we blame you for pulling us out of paradise. This is something separate from that.”
</p>
<p>
	“Gee, thanks. I was doing the right thing, Tamia, surely I’m not going to be punished any more for that?”
</p>
<p>
	Eight Harvesters suddenly burst into the diner, one of them clattering into Tamia and knocking the sword from her hand. The cyborgs surrounded them, various implements of death pointed at the three of them…wait did that guy…yeah…he had a vegetable peeler! It was either a complete baller psychopath move, or this guy got his upgrades from a bad chop shop.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh Lionel, you are a real albatross.” Hijoki muttered as Lionel raised his hands. The sword was at his feet, and for a second he considered grabbing the sword and having a figurative and literal stab at taking down the Harvesters, but with Tamia semi conscious…he couldn’t risk it, he was fond of her, not to mention he was pretty sure he would’ve stabbed himself through the face.
</p>
<p>
	“I didn’t know this place was a buffet lunch affair?”
</p>
<p>
	The door at the far side of the diner swung open in the breeze, and the Harvesters turned to see a slim looking man in the same style of duster and poncho that Grissom wore, his long coat blowing in the breeze even though it was a perfectly still day.. He flicked his hat up with a finger, revealing a playful smile, before pulling a familiar silver pistol. He moved like Grissom did, aggressive like a tiger, and graceful like a tiger who had studied ballet. He spun and shot three bolts of plasma that took the heads off each target, then rolled forwards, crossing his arms and unloading at the remaining five Harvesters in a swift arc. He pulled off his hat to reveal a face not completely unlike Grissoms, just a younger, less furious looking Grissom.
</p>
<p>
	“Pleasure to make your acquaintance.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Mookie sat, watching Grissom pacing back and forth in the communal space of the Swiftfeather, as Blotch reclined in a chair. Everyone was on tenterhooks, and the atmosphere on the ship was weighing heavily on them all. Mooks had not enjoyed the last few weeks, they had been angry and twitchy. Not at Lionel, though he was an easy scapegoat. It was the realisation that she was obsessed with destroying the Technomancer. When she was a hatchling, she thought her quest for information was well intentioned, but now? Now she wanted the fiend chasing them dead.
</p>
<p>
	“Where in the buttfuckery are they?” Grissom growled. “They should’ve been back an hour ago, I hope the kid hasn’t messed up.”
</p>
<p>
	“Lionel probably traded the shuttle for some magic beans.” Blotch said bitterly.
</p>
<p>
	“That’s enough, the two of you.” Mookie chastised. “However we feel right now, it wasn’t Lionel’s fault what happened to us. We invented those fantasies, we weren’t strong enough to pull away from them. We were drawn to them, like moths to flames.” She quickly put the zippo that she had been playing with away into her robes pocket.
</p>
<p>
	“That doesn’t make me feel better, Mooks.” Blotch looked down at the table. “I was happy in there. Now this place feels fake and cold.  Every time I look at that kid, I want to kill him.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom considered, and being he wasn’t a great thinker, his response came quick and clumsily. “I hate to admit any kind of responsibility unless it’s about killing or getting some sweet trim, but Lionel did us a kindness, methinks. Any happiness weren’t real in that place. Lionel done did good. The kid’s got good intentions.”
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig came slithering into the room, a panicked look on his face, and the others turned to face him quickly. “The Ria Grey is returning. And it’s got four lifesigns aboard.”
</p>
<p>
	“Hades’ sour teats, Lionel!” Grissom shouted as he drew his pistols and marched for the shuttle bay.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	“What’s the hubbub in here?” Taber hung down from a shadow in the beams above them. “I was having fun mocking Doots and Heath for watching reality television.”
</p>
<p>
	Heath tilted a head. “I seem to remember you having a few opinions on Kreboor the Conqueror’s Drag Race.”
</p>
<p>
	Taber sniffed. “That gaseous cloud just wanted to be fabulous.”
</p>
<p>
	“Time to nut up, peeps. We got incoming.” Doots turned her Keytar to maximum, and started to play the opening bars of Another One Bites the Dust by Queen. In response, her compatriots squared their shoulders and raised their weapons as the doors to the shuttle hissed and decompressed.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel walked out first with Tamia and Hijoki next. Tamia was deep in conversation with someone following, talking about her ten most favourite ways to eviscerate, and was up to “groin up” (at number two, beat by ‘the banana split’). As the man following descended the ramp, Grissom noticed the boots, the coat, the insignia of his house, the poncho, and then the face…of his brother Emmeth.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom spun his gaze to Lionel, who returned a hard look, something passing between them that no one else could’ve picked up on.
</p>
<p>
	“Grissom!” Emmeth yelled as he saw his brother, then ran to him and swept him up in an embrace. Grissom was in shock and gazed over at Lionel, another look passing between them. Grissom wrapped a meaty arm around his brother, a single tear rolling down his cheek which he quickly wiped away so as no one could accuse him of being a sissy.
</p>
<p>
	Everyone else turned to Lionel for explanation, but Lionel just stared, burning holes in Emmeth. Figuratively of course, he’s not Superman.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	“I ran for days, the Harvesters chasing me, only one gun. To this giant crevace.” Everyone sat at the table in the mess hall, except for Lionel - who had been pacing back and forth as soon as he realised Doots had given Emmeth his favourite Battle of the Planets mug - and Grissom, who leaned against the counter and listened intently. “My back was to this waterfall, and I took as many of them as I could to scrapyard hell before I dove off. I lost both my legs - I got them replaced as soon as I got back to civilisation, which explains the cool Robocop sound as I walk - and had to climb my way back out. When I got to the top, days later, Grissom had bugged out with my other gun, probably thinking me dead. Which I forgive you for, by the way.”
</p>
<p>
	“Mighty charitable.” Grissom flicked his hat in response.
</p>
<p>
	“That there is an amazing story, mah boy.” Ludwig whistled as Lionel tutted loudly. “It’ll be good to have another Duke o’ Lead on the team.”
</p>
<p>
	“But where’s he going to sleep? And which mug is he going to use long term?” Lionel asked.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom took a breath, “Can bunk in with me I reckon. Got a fair bit of catching up to do.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel was incensed. “When I asked to bunk in with you, you said you needed privacy and that you had a tendency to ‘sleep stab’!”
</p>
<p>
	Everyone looked uncomfortable, until Heath broke the silence. “Lionel, it is my understanding that when families need to reconnect, they need understanding and privacy.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots “Yeah, Lionel. Focus up and think of someone other than yourself for a few seconds.”
</p>
<p>
	“Are you kidding me? I’ve been doing nothing else since I woke up at the Waystation. I helped all of you, I’ve been trying to track Ellie down while you’ve been sitting around feeling sorry for yourselves.”
</p>
<p>
	“Come on, Lionel. We all want Ellie back, but…” Mookie started.
</p>
<p>
	“No, Mookie. You know I’m right, none of you have given me any help in trying to track her down. And now we’re just moving on to new crew members? Trading someone who might not be dead for someone who should be?” Lionel stared Emmeth down.
</p>
<p>
	“Hallway. You and me.” Grissom growled at Lionel. They marched out and the rest of the crew were silent until the door was shut behind them.
</p>
<p>
	“Sorry about that, Emmeth.” Hijoki muttered. “It’s been a tough few weeks and Lionel…”
</p>
<p>
	“Hasn’t been treated fairly.” Blotch interrupted. “By any of us. Still, he shouldn’t have taken it out on you.”
</p>
<p>
	“No reason to apologise, Grissom is a hard person to be around, he doesn’t exactly engender patience and understanding in those around him for too long. It’ll be fine as soon as Lionel knows I’ve no intention of taking his place.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom marched back into the room, but was too emotionally stunted to notice when everyone stopped talking abruptly. “Emmeth. Take your pack to my bunk, it’s the door with the cool picture of a skull giving the double bird. The crew have to vote on whether or not you can stay.”
</p>
<p>
	“What about Lionel?” Mookie sat straighter. “We can’t vote withou…”
</p>
<p>
	“Lionel has agreed to sit the vote out, so long as I do. To keep his snarkiness and my huge dick energy off the table.”
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth stood. “I thank y’all for your hospitality, regardless of the outcome.” He stepped through the door and down the hall to the sleeping quarters. Lionel was waiting for him, rearranging his folded arms to look mean.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m not falling for it, even if they are, you mug stealing, mentor taking, dapper dressed…” Lionel struggled.
</p>
<p>
	“I think the word you’re looking for is ‘Usurper’.” Emmeth offered.
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t help me insult you!” Lionel screamed. “I’m perfectly capable of being obnoxious without help, I learned form another Graves.”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re too sweet a guy to pretend to be a badass, Lionel. I ain’t here to take your place,. Hell, I like y’all too much for that. How about we bury the hatchet?” The cowboy held out a hand.
</p>
<p>
	“In my back you mean?” Lionel slapped his hand away. “You’re not fooling me, ghostboy. You aren’t my friend, from this day forth, you’re my nemesis.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel stormed off, leaving a bemused Emmeth in the hall.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	The vote had been unanimous, Emmeth was one of the crew now, much to Lionel’s chagrin. Tamia watched him intently, worried for her friend. She liked Lionel more than anyone else onboard, apart from Hijoki of course. She’d never met anyone so innocent and pure, and compared to her kill-crazy ninja with family issues persona, he was Mr Dependable. She was pretty sure she had a crush on him, but she was too much of a bro to act on it whilst Ellie and he were together. Friendship was a damn fine second for her. But his hatred for Emmeth was escalating. Lionel had developed a pretty sturdy backbone in the last few days, shoulder checking Emmeth in the corridor, openly calling him Cock Holiday or Wussy James, petulantly smashing his mug so that neither of them could drink out of it, and basically goading him into a fight. So when Emmeth came up with a plan to take the fight to the Technomancer, Lionel was already doubtful, and possibly a little drunk.
</p>
<p>
	“If’n you can see the future Mookie, why haven’t you tried to fathom a way to kill him?” Emmeth asked.
</p>
<p>
	Mookie looked at Lionel, who shook his head. They were more alike than either compared to admit. “My powers don’t work like that, Emmeth. I get loose imagery, but I need a Mothman tablet to properly order and interpret them. And the only tablets I know of were back on Ithea.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots squeezed their hand. “And that place has been cut off to us. The rest of the planet’s inhabitants took the longboats to who knows where, but we came through my portal here. There are no Mothman Proheseers in this reality.”
</p>
<p>
	“There were.” Emmeth said.
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig scoffed. “I might be a simple country squid, but are you saying there’s an enclave of psychics we can go see?”
</p>
<p>
	“No, they died centuries ago. Wiped out in the lamplighter wars, before humans were a mere speck of jizzum in the galaxy’s grand ballsack.”
</p>
<p>
	“Well thanks, Cock Brown, I left my Delorean in my other jeans pocket.” Lionel tutted “Unless you’re proposing we speak to extinct Propheseers by Ouija board?”
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth tried to ignore Lionel and smiled tersely as he went on. “But the gemstones they used to create the tablets, Maguffinium, still exists. On an asteroid in the Terros Sector.”
</p>
<p>
	“Sounds convenient.” Lionel mocked.“Probably next to the ‘Just what we needed’ Nebula, and the ‘Clearly a fucking trap that the Technomancer would know about” asteroid field.”
</p>
<p>
	“Enough.” Grissom sighed. “Why haven’t you gone down to get some?”
</p>
<p>
	“The mining town is having a bit of local colour, not something I could solve by myself. Some gang or something killing the crews. I thought it best to retreat and find backup.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh look, a Duke of Fled.” Lionel laughed until Grissom glared at him. “Oh what’re you looking at, you walking cliche?”
</p>
<p>
	“Fucking hell, and they call me dark.” Taber whistled, impressed.
</p>
<p>
	Hijoki spoke quickly to de-escalate the situation. “How about we go down to the planet and investigate for ourselves? Obviously we split into two teams, one to help the miners and one to retrieve the gems?”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch picked up her cudgel and pulled Bar’Thur’s jerkin over her wide body. “Grissom, you take your brother, Mookie, and Heath down to the mines. Mookie can identify what we need and Heath can check it for purity. I assume you aren’t going to let Mooks outta your sight?” She nodded to Doots.
</p>
<p>
	“Damn straight.” Doots was already tuning her keytar.
</p>
<p>
	“I’ll take Tamia and Hijoki, Taber, and Ludwig to the village to try and find out what we can from the miners.” Blotch sighed. “Lionel…”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m coming.” He brought the laser pistol brandished with the family crest that Grissom had given him out of the back of his waistband. “It’s not like I’m helpless is it? I’m an honorary Duke of Lead, remember?”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom seethed, and Emmeth turned, shocked that his gun was in the hands of another. “You gave him my gun?”
</p>
<p>
	“You were dead, brother.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m not now.”
</p>
<p>
	“You can prise it from my cold, Cheeto dusty hands, Emily, or whatever your name is. Oh wait, is it disrespectful to stain the sacred gun of a Duke of Lead with my orange fingers?” Lionel sucked the dust off his fingers noisily, then twirled the gun and slipped it into a holster at his waist in one motion, he had evidently been practising. “Come on guys, let’s go, I have to get away from the mildbunch for a few hours.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	The mining town of Settler’s Hook was a dirty, gritty town of simple ways and means. So when a Ninja with a sock-puppet and a laser sword, a sentient bag of jelly, a shadow assassin, a walking, talking squid, and a kid who had made himself a hat and sheriff badge out of cardboard to piss off Emmeth walked in to the local saloon, you can bet the music stopped and everyone turned around to survey the outsiders. The bar was dotted with buckets of gemstones, all shining a vibrant purple.
</p>
<p>
	“Were they just playing ‘Come on Eileen’ on the old-timey piano?” Lionel said. “You can’t even travel to the edge of the known universe without hearing that song.”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch nudged him with the cudgel. “Listen, mate, I enjoy the gradual degradation of an enemy's confidence as much as the next sack of jelly, but I need to be sure you’re over this Emmeth thing and you’re not going to fly off the handle and jeopardise the mission.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’ll look after Lionel.” Tamia put a hand to Lionel’s shoulder.
</p>
<p>
	“Why’re you all so down in the dumps? I can blend in with the best of them!” Lionel announced and marched to the bar to confront a burly looking miner who was covered in grime. “Excuse me barkeep, do you have a wine list? Preferably something zesty.”
</p>
<p>
	“Ain’t from around here, are ya boy?” The barkeep growled.
</p>
<p>
	Taber slithered swiftly to the bar and pulled Lionel back. “Sorry about that, guy is a bit unhappy because he’s lost his soulmate intelligent watch fighting an evil wraith machine, and his bounty hunter mentor has replaced him with his long thought dead brother.”
</p>
<p>
	The bar went even quieter as the whispered assessments of the adventurers stopped. Hijoki looked around.
</p>
<p>
	Tamia jumped up on a barstool and set her crossed feet up on the wooden bar as the Barkeep poured them five pints of grog and a bowl so that Hijoki could soak himself in the booze. “Smooth, Taber, perhaps you can tell the conservative miners we have a non-binary moth on the team and really set us on the back foot with these yokels.”
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig took a seat and wrapped a tentacle around his beer stein. “Let me handle this. Could we buy any of you fine people a drink to learn about your Maguffinium problems? We’re here to help you, good fellows. If you’ll have us that is.”
</p>
<p>
	The bar erupted into laughter, sick despair tingeing the sound. “We say something funny?” Blotch tapped the cudgel in her palm.
</p>
<p>
	“You ain’t the first adventurers lured to the riches of the Maguffinium mines. We mined that place for nigh on dickety dix years. Until we were warned off.”  An old miner cackled from the corner of the bar. He whistled as he talked, his single tooth moving back and forth in the breeze of his skanky breath. “You ain’t heard o’ the ‘Chase’, have you?”
</p>
<p>
	“I’ve heard it’s apparently better than the catch.” Tamia said with a wink. “But then I’d say people aren’t chasing the right kind of prey.”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re a funny one, ninja, but this Chase ain’t the kind you wanna catch. This one’s the kind that’ll turn around and splat you quicker than you can say ‘Oh please mister monster don’t crush me, too late you have, tell my wife and family I loved them, ‘no?’ well that’s just plain ungentlemanly to kill a man and then not inform his dependents…urghhh’...and scene.” The mad old miner bowed flamboyantly.
</p>
<p>
	The others looked between themselves, possibly wondering what they had done to be written into such insanity this episode. Ludwig clapped his tentacles together slowly, not really knowing what to do.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Doots brought her keytar out and played “Here Comes The Sun” by George Harrison, to light their way ahead in the dark tunnels they found themselves in, then reached behind her to grab Mookie’s foreleg.
</p>
<p>
	“Thanks, love.” Mookie said, her eyes big. “This place is beautiful, look how thatviolet light emanates from the stone.”
</p>
<p>
	“Eyes front, Mooks,” Grissom had a gun drawn at the foul smell on the air. “Something ain’t right here. Robot, can you make yourself useful scan ahead? See what we’re walking into?”
</p>
<p>
	Heath seemed to think for a second. “My name is Heath, but I can only assume you are talking to me.” He obliged. “I sense no signs of life, but there are hundreds of large deposits of the crystals about 200 metres ahead.”
</p>
<p>
	“Something did this.” Doots asked as she stepped over the corpse of a Miner. “Are you sure you don’t know anything about the things killing these folks, Emmeth?”
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth turned suddenly at the sound of a cracking, but it seemed to just be a falling stone. “Nothing other than rumours. Lots of death, no accounts from anyone living, shipments going missing. All signs point to some sort of gang of thieves.”
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, things don’t usually go that easy for us. Look, some of these gems glow much stronger than the others.” Mookie touched one of the glowing Maguffinium crystals and screamed in pain. They writhed on the ground, their forelegs going to their head. Everyone rushed to them, Doots propping Mookie up into her lap.
</p>
<p>
	“Mookie, speak to me. What’s wrong?”
</p>
<p>
	“The Chase.” Mookie whispered in reply. “The Chase.”
</p>
<p>
	A series of monstrous howls echoed from the far end of the cavern, behind them, above them. From everywhere.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Back at the bar, the buckets of gemstones shone with a purple light. The miners started to rise, picking up their shovels and picks and brandishing them like weapons. The mad old miner rose from his bow, his eyes glowing with the same violet intensity as the Maguffinium. Lionel, who had been sitting next to the piano player - singing the lyrics to Grandmaster Flash’s ‘The Message’, even though the tune was nothing like it and in no way matched up - stopped as the player turned and swung for him.
</p>
<p>
	“Not a good indictment of your talent, kid.” Taber used an arm to drag Lionel away before the musician could get his hands on him.
</p>
<p>
	“Chase. Chase.” The rabble chanted as they advanced.
</p>
<p>
	“Seems like the locals are revolting.” Ludwig said, pulling two grenades from his seemingly bottomless waistcoat pockets.
</p>
<p>
	“Have you smelled these dudes? They’re so revolting their virginities have grown back.” Blotch blocked a thrown pickaxe with her cudgel.
</p>
<p>
	Another two miners went to grab Tamia, who backflipped out of their reach. “Don’t hurt them, something’s clearly happened to them, they’re defenceless.”
</p>
<p>
	“Defenceless?” Taber turned to her, a pickaxe half embedded in his face. “How do you suppose we fight back? A meaningful hug? A pep talk?”
</p>
<p>
	“My clan used to practise the sacred art of Todashii, the art of containment. Basically, you…” A pick came down and grazed the edge of Hijoki, and he screamed as a seam ripped. “Just hit them for god’s sake.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel pulled the pistol from the holster, flicked it on and shot two of the miners in the kneecaps. “Have you guys not seen Terminator 2? Go for the legs. Stun them.”
</p>
<p>
	“Chase, Chase.” The miner said as he crawled towards Lionel.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	The wall of the mine shaft split open, as a giant being made from gemstones reached through and grabbed at Grissom. He shot at its fingers and dived to one side to avoid the grab. As the bolt hit the Gemgiant, Mookie cried out in pain. The Giant bellowed in pain, “Chase!”
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t hurt it!” Doots cried out. “It’s somehow linked to Mookie!”
</p>
<p>
	“Perfect.” Grissom sneered.
</p>
<p>
	“I think you misunderstood, Mr Graves, the situation is actually quite perilous.” Heath was beside him, turning his arm to a cannon. He shot blasts at the ceiling, burying the monster before it could fully free itself from the wall.
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, it was sarcasm I think, I’d have to ask Lionel if I used it right.” Grissom shook his head. “Well done, Bot.”
</p>
<p>
	As if in response, two more giants came from the floor and rear wall, pulling the cavern almost shut behind them. Emmeth looked his brother in the eye. “Looks like we’re going out in a blaze of glory, Griss.”
</p>
<p>
	“Chase!” Yelled one of the beasts.
</p>
<p>
	Doots pointed her keytar at a crop of gemstone and played a discordant note which the gem amplified. All the gemgiants, not to mention Mookie, doubled over in pain. “I can’t do that again, it might kill Mookie. We might want to try and reason with them.”
</p>
<p>
	“Not likely!” Emmeth said, levelling his pistol at the hurt giants. “We may not have a choice but to sacrifice Mookie, if any of us want to get out of here alive.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom pushed his brother’s gun down. “We all go home or nobody goes home. That’s the last word on it, Emmeth.”
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth straightened, taken aback. “Well, you’ve changed.”
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah. I don’t wanna lose another family.” Grissom turned to Doots. “What’s the plan?”
</p>
<p>
	“Lionel to Team Dickfeatures!” The radio squawked at Heath’s hip.
</p>
<p>
	“You are coming in loud, clear, and abrasive, Lionel.” Heath answered. “I hope your team have some good news, because we are likely to be destroyed by some giant monsters made of gemstones.”
</p>

	“I was contacting you guys for help!” the sound of smashing glass could be heard over the radio. “These miners have started attacking, they’re all purple-eyed and angry and these gems up here are shining just the same. When we tried to hurt the gems, the miners started hurting. There must be some connection down there! Some way to shut the down. The key is the gems, it has to be.”
</p>
<p>
	The crew looked at each other, then at Mookie, their normally black, bulbous eyes shining with a violet hue. The giants were advancing, each lumbering step pulling down more of the tunnels.
</p>
<p>
	“Stand by.” Heath switched the radio off.
</p>
<p>

	“They cut me off! Emmeth’s probably regaling them with how he single handedly got all the Jews out of Egypt or something.” Lionel muttered as the bar room battle gained more intensity and he punched a miner who couldn’t have been older than fifteen (a minor miner - he chuckled at his own joke) square in the nose. He felt bad because he hit a kid, but also pleased about his not so subtle shot at the child labour complex. “Taber, heads up!” He shot three more blasts from the laser pistol, which was running perilously low, and took the legs from under three more advancing miners.
</p>
<p>
	“Great shooting, kid.” Taber transformed his arms into a dustpan and brush and swept the legshot miners to the other end of the bar. They had built up quite a pile, but the mindless drones still advanced.
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig jumped onto the shoulders of one miner and wrapped his tentacles around her face.
</p>
<p>
	“Chase.” She growled.
</p>
<p>
	He wedged two of his tentacles in her mouth and prised it open. “I don’t know if you’re asking me for a refreshing follow up to a whiskey, dear lady, but instead have one of my own special concoctions. Guaranteed to give you just as much of a hangover headache.” He forced a stun grenade into her open mouth and jumped back to the bar as it went off in the woman’s face.
</p>
<p>
	“Ludwig, batter up!” Blotch gestured with the cudgel, and he threw his last stun grenade to her. She hit the orb into a crowd of them, the grenade bouncing between their heads and making random resonant metallic noises like a glockenspiel. As it exploded, it took at least ten of them out.
</p>
<p>
	Tamia grabbed a bottle of grog and poured it in a wide arc on the floor, then used her sword to ignite it, creating a wide fire barrier. She looked smug with herself until Hijoki shook his head.
</p>
<p>
	“We’re in the corner of a flammable wooden shack, Tamia.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, shitballs.” She huffed, her smile instantly vanishing. “Well let’s hope the others can find a way out of this.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Doots laid Mookie down, and lifted their face up to hers. “I don’t know if you can hear me, but I need to talk to whomever is controlling these gian…”
</p>
<p>
	“We are the Chase.” Mookie boomed in an unnaturally loud, gestalt voice. “You are intruding on our ancestral nurseries. You surface dwellers come again to steal our young - the glowing.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom leaned down. “We’re not with those fuckwits. We were told that you were mushing them into paste.”
</p>
<p>
	“We are, but wouldn’t you be if they stole your offspring?”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom thought. “It really depends. I’m not one for kids and I think they’d get pretty annoying pretty fast.”
</p>
<p>
	Heath quickly stepped forward. “What Mr Graves intended to say was that he understands your plight, and your measured response, given the circumstances, but we were not here to steal your children.”
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth raised his gun. “The hell we weren’t! We need one of those glowing rocks to fight the Technomancer!”
</p>
<p>
	The Chase reared up and looked to be getting ready to fight.
</p>
<p>
	“Wait!” Grissom commanded, then turned to his brother. “Emmeth, put that gun down.”
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth was panicking, twirling to face his attackers as more Chase seemed to be pulling themselves from the walls. “We gotta fight our way out, Griss! We can’t trust them.”
</p>
<p>
	“Emmeth. You either put your gun down, or I put you down.” Grissom levelled his pistol at his brother’s head.
</p>
<p>
	“You’d shoot your own brother?”
</p>
<p>
	“No.” Grissom said, before socking Emmeth across the jaw with the butt of a pistol. “But you need to go down just the same.”
</p>
<p>
	“We were told your gems could help us, we were told you were monsters.” Doots said to Mookie. “But we were misinformed and wouldn’t dream of hurting innocent beings just trying to exist. If you let us go we will be on our way.”
</p>
<p>
	The Chase stopped, considering for a moment. “We can only let you leave if you cease the others' attacks on us. We wish to be left in peace and will destroy every other living creature to obtain that.”
</p>
<p>
	“We don’t have control over them inbred halfwits.” Grissom sneered.
</p>
<p>
	“However. Am I right in thinking that you produce these gems like eggs?” Heath interrupted.
</p>
<p>
	“We do not know about your ‘eggs’.” Mookie said.
</p>
<p>
	“Do you lay your young, then imbue them with life at a different time period?”
</p>
<p>
	“Yes. The gems that glow are fertilised young, but some do not become viable and are discarded.”
</p>
<p>
	“And what do you do with those empty vessels?”
</p>
<p>
	“Nothing. They are useless, extraneous geological matter.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots sighed, and patted Heath’s leg in gratitude and relief. “Clever thinking, Bot-brain.” Grissom smiled.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	In the bar, the sounds of fighting suddenly stopped, and the fire was extinguished quickly. When the smoke had cleared, the crew heard the groans of about thirty miners in desperate need of knee surgery. The barkeep came up to Blotch and demanded what had happened and why so many of his regulars were now going to be keeping the town’s crutch maker in business for the next year. He was an artisan crutch maker, in a town of intense physical labour, don’t question the details of my story.
</p>
<p>
	“That would be down to a fair bit of greed on your part.” Mookie announced as she and the others walked through the door, Grissom carrying Emmeth in his arms.
</p>
<p>
	Heath was carrying an armful of inert, and wet gemstones, which Grissom seemed to be wary of. “These gems you have been mining, those that glow with the intense violet hue are the offspring of the beings in the mines and will need to be taken back. In return, the Chase have offered to provide you with regular deposits of these identical but slightly less shiny stones.” He dropped the pile to the floor.
</p>
<p>
	“Deposits is right.” Doots said disgustedly. “Just don’t ask what orifice they came out of.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Back on the ship, after a thorough use of the medical regenerator to repair 35 destroyed kneecaps and one 15 year old boy’s nose, the ship left the asteroid, with a new gemstone for Mookie and a job well done.
</p>
<p>
	But all was not well on the ship, and Grissom had a job to do, though how it’d land he didn’t much know. He marched through the mess hall, crowded with crew who were sharing dinner, and into the hallway outside, where Lionel was sitting between two deck supports and chewing sulkily on a sandwich.
</p>
<p>
	“You ready ta talk?” Grissom said.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel nodded, and stood to face Graves.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Mookie could feel something was about to break as Grissom marched through the mess hall, could feel the tension, the absence of Lionel weighing on her. But as Grissom came flying back through the doors not five seconds later, she knew it was the beginning of the end for their crew. Grissom’s face was covered in blood, gushing from his nose. He sat up quickly and roared, having to be restrained by Blotch and Taber, the table they were eating at overturned.
</p>
<p>
	“I’ll kill you, you little punk.” Grissom yelled, blood and spittle flying with every word.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel, his fist covered with Grissom’s blood, said nothing at all, just glared. First at Grissom, then at Emmeth. He walked casually over to the table and slammed the pistol in front of Emmeth.
</p>
<p>
	“I hope for your sake family means more than friendship, because when you lose someone and ask for his help, who knows what answer you’ll get from this coward.” Lionel turned to Heath. “Where’s the nearest inhabited sector?”
</p>
<p>
	“Zykoppi. There is a station three hours away on our present course.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel nodded then stared directly at his former friend in the cowboy hat. “Call me when we get there. I’m getting off this ship, before I grow a yellow streak longer than a diuretic dog just like the rest of you.”
</p>
<p>
	He turned on his heel and marched out to pack.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	The Swiftfeather landed on the pad early the next morning, and Lionel said his goodbyes to everyone, brisk as they were. As Emmeth watched him disembark, Grissom stood stone faced next to him. Tamia pushed through them, and threw her bag next to Lionel.
</p>
<p>
	“We’re coming with you buddy, no arguments.” Tamia gave him a nudge and then subtly winked at Grissom, who gave the smallest of nods.
</p>
<p>
	The pair walked into the mass of people on the concourse and were gone, the last the crew saw of them a quick wave from Tamia.
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth watched as Mookie and Doots stepped forward too. “We’ve been talking. There’s no easy way to say this, but the last few missions have taken us further away from trying to stop the Technomancer, and we’re worried that without Lionel, you’ll start becoming more aggressive in your pursuit of the Technomancer.”
</p>
<p>
	“Safe bet, Mooks.” Grissom said.
</p>
<p>
	“Then we’re going to take the gem and carve our own way. We have to believe there’s a way that isn’t just punching the Technomancer to death.” Doots said. “We’ve seen that approach…it…it doesn’t work. Three of our friends paid the price for that.”
</p>
<p>
	“I won’t try and convince you to stay, each person roasts their own hog.” Grissom nodded, not observing the confused looks of the others.
</p>
<p>
	“If you’re going, I’m with you.” Blotch announced. “Wouldn’t forgive myself if anything happened to you two. Hallie and Bar’Thur wouldn’t be pleased.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m a lover, not a fighter, my dear.” Ludwig said. He slithered over to Mookie and took her foreleg. “I’m a pretty good schemer, I think I could help you.”
</p>
<p>
	“I know in my head it won’t do any good to fight that fucker, but my heart…I want to fight. I want to avenger Hallie, and Ria, and Bar’Thur.” Taber said, taking a step up on the Swiftfeather’s ramp. Blotch hung her head, losing another friend so soon hurt.
</p>
<p>
	“I think it is useless to confront the Technomancer either way,” Heath said matter of factly. “But I think a resolution sooner rather than later would be preferable, and I am keen to confront this thing nonetheless.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom seemed surprised that Heath was staying, and nodded to the rest of the team. Once everyone had packed what meagre possessions they had, they left Grissoms’s team and joined the throngs of people at the station.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Once the ship pulled away from the space station, Emmeth moved into Lionel’s old room, and pulled a small device from the pocket of his duster.
</p>
<p>
	His mission had been a success, his divide and conquer plans working better than anyone could have predicted. With a flick of a switch, a blue hologram of the Technomancer appeared.
</p>
<p>
	“It is done, my master.”
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
