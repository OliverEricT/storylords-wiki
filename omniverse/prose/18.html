Episode 18: All We Ever Wanted

By Rich Masters

Prompts: Silver and Dinosaurs

It was dark in the engine block, darker than that back alley you were left in after prom night, or those thoughts you feel when you try and work out when your daddy left you. Yeah, that’s right, cry, you little dumpster diving, dadless bitch. The darkling, Taber, made it even darker as he slithered though the slip drive’s regulators, expanding himself to find the small microfractures in the casing of the drive - with these abilities, why the hell didn’t he have a girlfriend, he wondered? Taber sighed the deep sigh of someone who knew he was going to be asked a series of dumbass questions from dumbass people who couldn’t read his emotions yet and left the unit and rejoined said dumbasses.

“What’s the verdict?” Mookie asked, and Taber resisted the urge to turn himself into a noose for his own neck.

“I’ve been around the system again, coated in the special sealant that Heath suggested, but the fractures are everywhere. The good ship Swiftfeather is not the first woman to be fucked by a machine, but Freddie did a real number on us.” Taber sighed.

“I feel somewhat responsible here.” Lionel had taken the brunt of the blame, and rightly so, he had brought the organic hating robot on board, still insisting the small psychopath could be tamed.

“Live in that feeling a while, kid.” Blotch eyed Lionel over her cudgel, and Taber felt she was weighing up whether to swat him with it.

Tamia stepped forward. “Woah, woah, woah. I mean, both groups took in robots that could’ve turned on us. Lionel can’t help being woefully naive and innocent, like a baby deer, stumbling around from danger to danger, not knowing who he’s hurting, or what damage he’s causing…wait am I defending you or attacking you? I lost track.”

Lionel cleared his throat. “I’m of the opinion you should always shoot for the moon, right? Because if you miss, you’re still among the stars?”

“We are among the stars, with a broken ship - that appears to be the problem, Lionel.” Ludwig tutted, they seemed to all be annoyed with the boy. “We are gonna die of hypothermia, if the Technomancers don’t catch up with us first.”

Heath sat at the ship’s controls, and spun in his chair towards the group. “I am currently manoeuvring the ship on local system speed.  This should buy us some time. However, the reason I have dramatically swung in my chair thusly is that some sort of deep space repair station has appeared on our sensors about two hours away at present velocity.”(Editors note: Local System Speed is similar to but definitely not impulse like in Star Trek, just in case Paramount are listening - i don’t want to be buttfucked by Roddenberry’s corpse or anything)

“A repair station? When we most need it? Within spitting distance?” Grissom removed his pistols to check the sights were clear. “That sounds as convenient as when Jeffrey Driodstein deactivated himself in his holding cell.”

“But if it’s a choice between getting killed by some Technomancers and potentially getting killed by some new thing, then I vote the new thing. Who’s with me?” Doots tried to rally the troops, but when she looked around everyone just shrugged or looked away.

“Set course for the obvious trap, Heath.” Mookie ordered.

***

As they disembarked into the docking bay of the station, Lionel watched Grissom blow out an impressed whistle at the entirely silver room. It blinked with an unnatural shine. “Look at this place, it’s fancier than eating foie gras off an heiress’ buttocks.”

After everyone turned to him, Lionel said “He knows.” And stared off into space remembering what he had walked into on that Sunday afternoon. “I do too.” he whispered.

Heath stroked a hand against the wall. “Impossible, it seems as if the silver panelling on this wall has just been forged. The metal shows no trace of imperfection, no ageing whatsoever. The ambient temperature, light settings, oxygen quality - it is all perfect.” The rest of them stared at various parts of the bay, it was shiny and new. Like so new that Josh could eat your momma’s vajayjay off of it. Wait, I hear you say, why Josh? Well firstly, I’m married, so I’m a off the market now, but also because I have standards. Yeah, that’s right, I ain’t eating your skanky momma’s meatloaf, let alone her pleasuredome.

“Sounds too good to be true to me.” Blotch raised the cudgel she had recently decorated with stickers of frogs. “Weapons ready, crew.”

“My friends, my friends.” A cheerful voice came from the corner of the bay as if from nowhere. An ancient looking old crone came waddling out, wearing a hood and veil so only her toothless mouth showed “Welcome to the station. I am Duchess Custos, the hottest attendant this side of the incontinence pants aisle at your local supermarket. It’s been a long time since I had visitors so please excuse any odd behaviour. Giblets!”

“Odd doesn’t explain why you’re not wearing any pants, dear lady.” Hijoki winced, if you can imagine socks wincing. His mouth slit kind’ve twisted. Look, I don’t criticise your sock puppet characters, ok?

“Oh, that’s just in case one of you was a potential 14th ‘Mr Custos’ in the waiting.” She winked at Grissom, who Lionel had to restrain gently, as the bounty hunter pulled his bowie knife from his belt in response.

Blotch put a hand out. “Alright crew, weapons down.”

“What is this place, you mad old bat?” Taber hissed.

“This is the Waystation. A magical place made of fairy dust and wishes, where all your dreams come true. You want a hogie, we got all the hogies! You want to visit sports games of the past, like the robo pit fighting finals where Bret The Hitbot Heart beat that out of control Photocopier, you got it! You want to see a Duchess do a handstand? Well maybe later, I just had a big lunch.”

“Alright, weapons back up people.” Blotch announced with a sigh.

“Wait, wait. I may be a few fries, a burger, a drink and a cute toy short of a Happy Meal - whatever that is, I don’t know - but this station is the realiest dealiest! There’s a library with every book (bar Ready Player One because that book is the wooooorst), a hologrammatic Cineplex with every movie ever made, all the help to fix your ship, and even an old lady who can do handstands on lighter meals!”

Heath held a hand up to stop the crone as she bent over to try the handstand. “You said we could fix our ship?”

“Come, come.” Custos beckoned with a wizened old finger, hobbling away.

Heath dipped his head. “What do we have to lose?”

Tamia smirked. “You can tell you’re a relatively new joiner to these adventures. I once got bit by a silver-haired wolf that turned out to be a were-biddy. Before you know it I was howling at the moon and craving hard candies.”

***

“And this…is the workshop.” Custos opened a large door that led to a fabrication plant.

Ludwig visibly stepped back, unable to take it all in. “Mah dear lady, this is no mere workshop, this is a full factory.” He turned to Heath, wringing his little tentacles in excitement.  “We could convert the Swiftfeather…” He turned to Grissom who was opening his mouth. “...Stroke Conveyance of Grissom Graves 2…into a warship. We could fabricate the weapons we need to kill those psychotic murderers chasing us, we could even put a hot tub in! I’m something of a weaponsmith myself, having to secretly run resistance movements to free my people from our Technomancer.”

“Then it makes sense for you to help me, Ludwig.” Heath nodded. “Let us get to it.”

“Come along the rest of you, I’m sure we’ll find something to whet your collective whistles while you wait.” Custos moved on.

***

“What’d you mean, holograms?” Grissom sneered. “If I’m punching someone in the face, I want them to be feeling it and worrying how their surviving families will deal without the primary breadwinner.”

“Yeah, if I wanted to beat up someone with no feelings, I’d just talk trash to myself in the mirror.” Taber laughed, and when everyone else turned to him in sympathy, he shrugged. “What?” He said, oblivious.

Custos hobbled over to the panel and quickly tapped at the screen. A clearing in a dense forest appeared in the once empty room, and with a few more taps, two henchmen looking dudes appeared, adopting the fisticuffs position.

“The Holotrainer can be programmed to produce any setting, any person, with any personality trait you want.” Custos explained. “You can make them laugh off your attacks, or make them cry for their mommas when you hit them. One of the women who was here last used to spend all her time in here with a sadomasochist hologram who used to get off on her beatings.”

“Wait, what do you mean ‘used to be here’?” Ellie chimed in, but Grissom talked over her.

“I’m staying here while you nerdlingers fix the ship and get your chi centred and whatnot. Crone, load me up ten Technomancers and a Lionel to boss around whilst I fight. Apocalyptic wasteland setting.”

The computer heard his request and populated the room. A variety of different Technomancers appeared along with a hologramatic Lionel that instantly went into a list of top ten Godzilla monsters.

“How does she know what the Technomanc…” Ellie began, before being interrupted again.

“I feel personally affronted!” Lionel muttered. “I mean it’s clearly Gigan, but I’m offended.”

“I’ll stay.” Taber transformed his arms into serrated blades. “I need to let off some steam.”

“Me too” Tamia said. “It’s been a few weeks since I killed anything, and I’m starting to get a bit tetchy.” She flung Hijoki to Doots. “Look after the old man will you? Find him a linen basket to nap in or something.”

As Hijoki grumbled obscenities, and the others left them to it, Grissom gave the pair a wide grin. “Well then, looks like we got us a good old fashioned kill off.

In an instant, taber flashed his serrated arm, extending it past Grissom’s face to lop the hologrammatic Lionel’s head clean off. Grissom turned back to Taber, confused.

“1-nothing.” The Darkling hissed.

“Oh, it’s on, bitches.” Tamia laughed as she ignited her katana.

***

“Well what wonders have you got for us, I wonder?” Hijoki bitterly muttered. “A collection of lamps for Mookie? Maybe a therapist for Lionel here?”

“Actually,” the crone said happily. “You, Doots and Mookie are very easy to provide for. You want answers. And you, Lord Hijoki, know more than most that answers come from understanding. And sometimes from long nights of the soul after having one too many drinks and sexing up the random uggos at the bar, am I right?” She held a hand aloft, but no one returned the high five. She moved to another door further down the corridor and swung it aside to reveal a gigantic library the likes of which the universe had never seen. It seriously had everything, the complete works of Shakespeares across the multiverse, even the version of Hamlet with editing so it wasn’t fucking four million years long, George RR Martin’s complete coffee table books of Westeros (still working on that latest book though, wink), and works from versions of great writers who had never been given the chance to share tier potential masterworks. They had JC Penny catalogues, pristine issues of Nintendo Power, and vintage Playboys. In one corner they had microfiche copies of every newspaper ever written throughout the Omniverse, histories of every species, encyclopaedia of every flora and fauna. And in another corner, a vast array of tablets, showing prophecies untold in Mookie’s universe.

“It’s the entirety of knowledge in the galaxy. Every galaxy.” Doots was in awe.

“Even that rare one where the police are a force for good.” Custos chuckled. “And also we don’t stock JK Rowling, because fuck that Transphobic old prune.”

Hijoki turned to the crone. “You mean I could…”

“...Find out if any of your clan survived? Find out how to keep Tamia safe? Yes, of course. And you Doots, could discover how long you’ve been drifting through time and what it means. And Mookie, there are prophecies that could unlock the keys to defeating the Technomancer. It’s all here, you just have to find it.”

The three of them shambled in like zombies, unable to close their mouths or look at any one spot longer than a few seconds as they tried to take it all in. The crew seemed placated, happier than they’d been in a long time. And only Ellie noticed the toothless smile that Custos had plastered across her face. Her eyes shone under her veil unnaturally.

As the door closed, Custos turned to Lionel and Blotch. “Now you two! How about a movie?”

Lionel perked up. “I’d love that, something to make me feel good, it’s been a rough couple of days.”

Blotch had been quiet for a long time. “I’m not interested, I just want to sleep.”

“You miss your friend.” Custos put a hand on Blotch’s shoulder and led her.

Ellie chirped, flashing a confused emoji on the face of the watch. “Lionel, how could she…”

“More each day.” Blotch would have sobbed if she could, looking at the cudgel at her belt. “He was my brother in arms. I feel lost without him.”

“Maybe Face Off, or Speed, some chewing gum for the brain that makes you forget everything.” Lionel said absent mindedly.

“Bar’Thur and I hunted Drakes in the Northern Province, Lionel. A film just isn’t going to cut it.” Blotch sighed.

“Wait! Jurassic Park!” Lionel jumped up and down like a kid. “It has dinosaurs, and they’re just like Drakes!”

“Excellent idea.” Custos lead them into the holoplex, and ordered the film to be loaded up. “With our technology, you can even exist in the movie. Go hunt some dinosaurs!”

Lionel seemed unimpressed. “Well, that’ll mess up the story!”

As Blotch went inside, Custos grabbed Lionel’s arm. “Wait there a minute young man, I want to talk to you about something for a second.” She led him down the corridor.

“Lionel, Lionel, this is getting weird now. Lionel!” Ellie shouted, but Lionel couldn’t hear her.

As the door shut, Blotch wandered through the jungles of Jurassic Park in the rain. It was amazing, the rain patted against her shell and small hologrammatic bugs flitted in her vision. In the distance, sounds of battle could be heard. Ear splitting roars of pain could be heard as she ran towards the fight, thick palm leaves slapping against her face. When she burst into the clearing, she saw a giant dinosaur lying dead on the floor, tongue hanging out of its caved in face.

“Gods lass, what kept you? I’ve been waiting weeks.”

She turned to the voice, almost not wanting to see him, knowing it couldn’t be real. Bar’thur sat atop the dead beast with a wide grin, leaning against the new giant war hammer he wielded. “I’ve missed you, you big ole bag of rat jizz.”

Blotch climbed up the beast at pace and collapsed into the frog’s arms. “Fuck yourself, fly bait.”

“Lionel, take a seat.” Custos said to Lionel. He wandered to the chair in the dazzling white room and sat dozily, then proceeded to stare at nothing.

“It’s funny isn’t it. How easy it is? To really conquer someone? People think power is the great dominator, but it’s like they say - ‘kill them with kindness’.” Custos took the seat opposite and looked at Lionel, who was now drooling. When she got no response she looked down at the watch. “It’s rude to ignore people when they’re talking to you, Ellie.”

Ellie’s emoji turned to an angry face. “What are you doing to them? Are you trying to hurt them?”

Custos laughed in a high cackle. “No silly. I want to please them. The way station is a place for relaxation, for rest. I give them everything they ever wanted. For Blotch it’s her friend, for Mookie it’s for her powers to make a difference. Some want to create, or destroy, some like Lionel here…just want the pressure of life gone. And I give them that.”

“You’re an A.I. too. That’s why your abilities don’t work on me.” Ellie sounded impressed. “Whatever you used must be pretty strong, they couldn’t even hear me.”

“It’s a little siren signal I’ve been perfecting over the years. I have been floating in this sector for thousands of years, serviced hundreds of crews, made their last years pleasant beyond compare.”

“These people are nowhere near death.” Ellie said with disgust.

Custos shrugged. “Really? How long do you think they’ll last here? A little of what you fancy does you good, but a lot can kill you.”

“The crew are young, vibrant, they wouldn’t want to live a short life of this fantasy, no matter how good it felt.” Ellie protested.

“Are you sure?” She nodded to Lionel. “Lionel, what is causing you such sorrow at the moment? What’s weighing on you?”

Lionel focused instantly on Custos, but his voice sounded as if he were dreaming as he spoke. “I saw my future back with Eezee. I saw myself betray the team, then join the Technomancer.”

“No.” Ellie couldn’t, wouldn’t believe it.

“Tell me what you would give up to stop that happening?” Custos asked.

“Anything.”

“Your life?”

Lionel didn’t even hesitate. “Yes.”

“Case closed Ellie.” Custos smiled sadly. “Isn’t it better to let them die in bliss, than make them suffer?”

“No.” Ellie’s emoji switched to a sneer.

“Well whatever, this is my house, my rules.” Custos stood. “When they’re dead like all the many others, you can live here with me or go, your choice. I’ll leave you here with Lionel as long as you want. His delusional fantasy is all about you, it’s quite sweet actually.”

Custos left to check on the others, and the door swished shut behind her, leaving Ellie with her comatose boyfriend.

“Please Lionel…Please shake out of it.” She said, as Lionel drooled. He smiled, whatever fantasy he was in too important for him to hear.

“Tell us why we shouldn’t kill you, annoying little robot.” Forex Santo the Technomancer asked, his voice dropping with disdain.

“Well, I come here to subjugate myself upon your mercies.” Freddie was shaken, these machine gods were nothing like he imagined, one was even an organic.

“You’ll find no mercy here.” the wraith Technomancer floated above them, sneering at the small circular droid. “Only release.”

“Wait, fellows.” The android Technomancer held a hand up. “We are flattered by your obedience, but we do not seek to be worshipped, we wish to kill those who we are chasing. You said you knew where they were, what they were after.”

“I do, my lords.”

The three pounced on Freddy and ripped him to jagged pieces. When they were done, Freddy lay on the floor still and leaking lubricant. The Android plugged himself into Freddy and downloaded his memories with a shudder.

“They’re in the Arrowhead Nebula. Prep the ship and ready the army.”

TO BE CONTINUED.
