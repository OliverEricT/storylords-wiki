<p>
	Three months before the explosion on Ilima.
</p>
<p>
	“Will you just calm down!” 
</p>
<p>
	The Reap woman gasped as she tried to prise the crocodilian hands from around her neck. The thing was too strong, and he smelled like an old leather handbag full of day old farts. The cyborg Norgaard poindexter was behind him, rushing towards them with the stun cuffs. She kicked at the turned-over commissary chair next to her, which flew into metal Milhouse’s ankles. The blow sent him as flat and splayed as your mum after a glass of cheap rose and a cheeky wink, and the cuffs attached themselves to the beast’s long, thick - I know where your minds are going but no, bad dogs - tail. The word was TAIL.
</p>
<p>
	The Crocodile howled in pain and released the girl, who quickly got to her feet and pulled a small dagger from her boot. He was a hulking mass of green and yellow that walked somehow on two legs. His muscles bulged, but as he reset himself, somehow pushing a beastial rage back, he readjusted what looked like reading glasses perched on his snout.   The Crocodile turned towards his fellow. “I can see how you got confused, Hallgrim, considering I’m a 500lb green reptile and she a 120lb Reap waif, but please try not to attack me again.”
</p>
<p>
	 “Shove it up your scaly shaft, Oryx.” The cyborg said as the prison emergency lights continued to shine red. His orange mechanical eyes flickering in anger behind his aviator shades he wore even though they were inside. “The little Reap is a slippery little one in’t she? Can see why the prize for offing her is so good.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx tilted his head to stare at the Reap woman. “The plentiful nature of the bounty is not always correlated to the strenuousness of the mission, but in this case, I agree this delinquent is indeed a most perplexing prey.”
</p>
<p>
	The Reap girl’s blood smeared mouth stayed coldly flat as she pushed her skins up to the elbows of her toned and tanned forearms. “Enough words, Cock-o-dile. Let us fight.” 
</p>
<p>
	The alarms sounded loudly around them, filling the room uncomfortably. From the far side of the commissary a prison detail dressed head to toe in riot gear filed in and around the three jumpsuited detainees. 
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim looked around anxiously, cradling the stun cuffs before turning his nose up in a sneer. “Don’t suppose you got anything bigger in your boot, eh?”

	SIX DAYS EARLIER
</p>
<p>
	The sounds of the prison were loud today, with ‘your mother’ insults and casual xenophobia running more rampant than when someone brings up 9/11 or the war of 1812 on Storylords recording day. The power cuts besetting the station were worse than ever, and they were making people tetchy.Oryx sat with his ample derriere bulging over the side of his reading chair in his cot and closed his book. He sighed, then went through the open barred door of his cell to look out on the pen over the railing.
</p>
<p>
	“People, and non corporeal entities.” He bellowed.
</p>
<p>
	“Awwww.” said RJ74, the small cleaning droid who had been given a life sentence for his role in the Stellan Circus Clown Massacres (he hated comedy because he lacked the capacity to understand it). 
</p>
<p>
	“...And droids.” Oryx held his hand up. “My apologies RJ74, every day is a learning opportunity and all that. Can you all please try to keep the noise levels to a minimum, so I might finish my book?” 
</p>
<p>
	The inmates of prison outpost BOO8135 fell silent and went about their prison beatings and shanking related deaths in a deadly hush. Oryx knew that it was cruel to use his increased mass to intimidate the general population, but it had meant that he could get through the classics in his time here. He had dedicated his time to reading the old books of the lost worlds - William Shatner’s Tekwars, TV Guide February 1985 (will Maddie and David get together this week in Moonlighting?), and the novelisation of the game of the film of the game Street Fighter 2 (foreword by Jean-Claude Van Damme). 
</p>
<p>
	A small, unassuming Velitean joined him at the railing, wearing the same orange jumpsuit, his diminutive stature doing nothing to offset his intense arrogance.  Oryx knew instantly who he was - the head of the Velitean mob, Boopi Di Beppi - affectionately referred to in criminal circles as the Spaghetti Strangler. “Not often you see a splicer. Not since before the war I hear.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx said nothing. It had been all the rage before the war with the Norngaard and the Humans, the Veliteans would splice animal DNA into their genetic code with animals. At first, it was a niche among the furry community, but then rich kids wanted to be as fast as a Ryad, or as strong as a Tarvul, or most frequently…hung like a Validar Sex-Bear. But after the war had started, when the Velitaens had seen the cyborg population of their mortal enemies the Norngaard, any genetic deviation had become illegal on Velit.
</p>
<p>
	“Quiet type, eh?” Mr Beppi shrugged. “Well how would you like a one way ticket out of here, handsome? Enjoy a peaceful life in a bayou somewhere?”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx raised a brow and moved back to his cell. “Thank you, but my interest in whatever endeavour you will no doubt propose is nil. I have a probation review coming up, I would prefer to get back to my life via legitimate means.”
</p>
<p>
	The small man followed him to his cell and sat on his cot, he took a file from the inside of his jumpsuit and threw it to the reptile. “Well according to this, you’ve got as much of a chance as a toothless hick in a bottle opening contest. The Parole Board has already decided you’re a danger to the civvies. You’re going to rot in here until you become a fine pair of shoes for the warden.”
</p>
<p>
	Filled with fury, Oryx dropped the papers and bounded to the cot, lifting the man up by the neck and sliding him up the wall until he was face to snout with him. His breath released in snorts from his nostrils that fogged the gangster’s glasses up.
</p>
<p>
	“Wow, proved them wrong, eh?” The impertinent little deplorable gasped.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx realised what he was doing and dropped Beppi, turning away to settle himself. “Even if what you say is true, which would probably be a new sensation for you, I would still rather serve my time in peace.”
</p>
<p>
	The odious wretch stood and flattened his jumpsuit. “How about in pieces? I know exactly the crime you’re in for, Mr Oryx, and the population out there you have so terrified would tear you apart if they all knew the truth. I’ll keep your secret if you agree to do exactly as I say.”
</p>
<p>
	As horrid as the little troll was, Oryx had no doubt he was right, the prison ingrates would turn on him en masse if they found out what he had been incarcerated for. They had all assumed it was murder, or some rage related activity. In truth it was far worse. He was strong, but there was no way even he could defend himself against the entire correctional facility. Oryx turned to the slimy little troll, and sighed. “What is it you require my assistance for, Mr Beppi?”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim sat still as the list of books rolled around on the display in he cyborg visual HUD, there were so many self-help books in the prison library, but this was the third time he had searched for the book.
</p>
<p>
	“Ain’t here.” He admitted. “Could it be listed under anything else, mate?”
</p>
<p>
	The con sniffed, twitching with the edginess of a man you didn’t really want to say ‘no’ - or much of anything else - to. “Try ‘An Arsonist’s Guide To Effective Torturing’.” He said, looking suddenly behind him as if he’d heard something.
</p>
<p>
	One more search gave Hallgrim the book he was looking for, but he hesitated to confirm it. “Listen pal, you’re just reading it for curiosity’s sake, right?” 
</p>
<p>
	The con pulled a match from a box in his pocket and nervously flick at it with a thumbnail as he laughed. “Yeah. Curiosity. Right.”
</p>
<p>
	This conversation was starting to bore Hallgrim, so he nodded. “Good enough for me. Row 4, in the ‘Probably not a good idea to have in a galactic prison compound’ section.” As the convict moved away, Hallgrim double clenched his fingers and thin, rigid wires protruded from his fingernails so he could sign the book out by typing faster.  “Hmmm. ‘Billy Baby Burner - Self Help Book #42’.” He said to himself, before someone closed the top of his folding computational machine down on his hands. He whimpered in pain as the lights flicked off and on again, revealing Hallgrim’s visitor in all his lack of glory. Hallgrim looked up into the beady dark meatball eyes of the Spaghetti Strangler.
</p>
<p>
	“Hello, Hallgrim. Commit any petty crimes lately?” 
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim smiled. “I pissed in your mum’s cornflakes this morning, that petty enough for ya?”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s a good thing I like you, Hallgrim.” Beppi laughed, then pressed the machine top down harder, causing Hallgrim to grimace in pain. “But don’t test that affection. Remember if I hadn’t stepped in on your first night here you’d be on date nights with Ballsdeep the Bountyhunter.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim was sweating. “Look, like I said at the time, I ain’t questioning the fella’s lifestyle choices - apart from the sexual assault of prisoners and eating of their skins, I’ve just got a girlfriend already. She goes to another prison, you wouldn’t know her. She got imprisoned for being too sexy. Don’t look it up, their prison records are down, ya know?”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re full of shit, boy.” Boopi Di Beppi flashed his shark eyes at Hallgrim - he’s had his usual eyes replaced with shark eyes to seem more intimidating. He released the laptop and Hallgrim rubbed his bruised digits. “I’m here to call in that favour.”
</p>
<p>
	“As far as a recall, you already cashed that favour when you got me to patch you into the security subsystems to help you smuggle contraband in.” Hallgrim sneered. “Unless you need more sherbert and pasta-themed porn already.”
</p>
<p>
	“Smart mouth on you, kid.” Beppi smiled. “Consider this the last part of that favour. In a few days, a friend of mine is going to come calling, and you, my cyborg friend, are going to help him.”
</p>
<p>
	“Help him do what, exactly?” Hallgrim cradled his hands. “I hope it isn’t a handjob, because me fingers are well and truly fucked already.”
</p>
<p>
	Beppi smiled his shark smile, I mean this guy was a fin away from being a sharkman at this point. “The two of you are going to kill a prisoner for me.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	It was two days before Oryx entered the prison library, and there at the counter waiting for him, was a Norngaard cyborg who looked like he was born to take the role of prison librarian. He was slight and weasley looking, his body smothered with implants. From visual receptors, to enhanced hands, to a radio antennae that picked up both FM and AM radio! It was all he needed, a filthy, techno-freak Norn to work with on a job he was desperate not to partake in.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh good, a Velitean.” The Norn didn’t even look up from his book, ‘Men are from Mars, Nothing of any value is from Velit’. “I was looking for a way to make my time in maximum security with rapists and killers somehow seem comparably less miserable.”
</p>
<p>
	“Days must indubitably be terrible merely existing as a Norn.” Oryx said through gritted teeth.
</p>
<p>
	The war might have been over for a long time, but the scars were as rooted as Mitch McConnell’s obvious dementia, the hatred so burned in it was like showing a red rag to a bull or a colour chart of brown paint to a police officer.
</p>
<p>
	“Listen pal, I’m a black belt in four types of deadly martial arts, and my dad was the heavyweight boxing champ of the Outer Rings.” Hallgrim muttered. “You can’t intimidate me.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx shook his head. “I’m not trying to intimidate you, fool, I’m trying to get this nonsense over with so I can regain some of the brain cells lost in this pointless diatribe.”
</p>
<p>
	“Beppi said you’d be coming, that you and I were to off a prisoner.” Hallgrim put down his book and stared at Oryx. “Which’ll probably be a break from all the childeating and old lady robbing that genetrash like you are used to.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx bristled, his scales tightening. “Did you have to utilise your inbuilt dictionary for any of those long words, Norn, or were they indelibly tattooed across your mother’s back so you had something to read while you sired some new cretinous siblings?”
</p>
<p>
	They looked at each other for a long time, a hard stare that could have fried an egg. Until Hallgrim did something unexpected. Threw back his head and laughed. “Alright, Velitean. I can work with you. I’m Hallgrim.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx offered a tentative hand. “Oryx.” He growled.
</p>
<p>
	With a sneer, Hallgrim looked at Oryx’s outstretched claws. “I said I can work with you, I didn’t say I wanted to pick out our forever home.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx pulled a piece of card from his pocket, the sort of record card that normally sat in the cover of a library book. “Beppi gave me this.”
</p>
<p>
	They moved over to the stacks to locate the book referenced on the card, finding it instantly. It was juxtaposed against the rest, sticking out like your mothers phone number in my contacts list. Wait, why is her number in there? Listen Janice, or Martha, or whatever your basic old bitch name is, don’t be drunk dialling me at 9:30pm on a Tuesday when you’ve polished off a bottle of whatever bargain bin bleach that passes for wine at the discount aisle of your local 7/11, begging me to be your baby’s daddy because I’m “one of the only decent fathers out there”. 1 - I know bitch, you don’t have to tell me. 2 - I’m not interested, you look and smell like a foot, and 3 - your son is 37 years old, you probably should just bite the bullet and get him a therapist or a chiropractor at this point. Maybe both if his birthday is near christmas and you can palm it off as one present. I’m blocking your number now, bye.
</p>
<p>
	The book had no signs of obvious library wear, in fact the binding and leather was virtually new. It was titled, ‘How to Win Friends and Influence People’, written by the head of the intergalactic police. Hallgrim pulled the book from the row and opened it, giving Oryx a raised eyebrow and a derisive snort of laughter as they surveyed the contents inside. In a hollow in the pages sat the two items all police officers think can gain them friends and influence - a set of restraints and a loaded gun.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim took his tray of indistinguishable grey looking slop that looked and smelled like day old jizz, past his usual table and went to sit with Oryx. The other Norn inmates stared daggers and threw daggers at him, but luckily they bounced harmlessly off Oryx’s thick hide. One cursory look around Casa de Crim revealed the Velit were giving Oryx a similar amount of stink eye at his choice of dining partner. The prison complex was at boiling point, and the guards were edgy as they had been one man down for the majority of the week, with no relief in sight. As far as Oryx knew, it was Correction Officer Damage, the gentleman with the one eye who loved to bludgeon new fish with his nightstick. Hopefully he had succumbed to painful dysentery.
</p>
<p>
	“We better get this done quick, before this whole place explodes at a time when everyone wants to turn on us.” Hallgrim muttered. “I feel as wanted as a stray pube in a yogurt.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx stared straight at his gruel and began eating. “Beppi explained the Prisoner is being transferred today, don’t blow a fuse.”
</p>
<p>
	“A transfer? After lunch? That’s not their usual protocol.” Hallgrim pushed his tray across the table, his appetite gone.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx took another spoon of grey, nearly missing his mouth as the lights failed again. “Scuttlebutt says the prisoner, whilst in restraints, broke a correction officer's nose then tore another’s left testicle clean off.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim laughed. “Fella deserves a medal. Anyway, Scuttlebutt is full of shit, you remember that story last week about that hydra beast in solitary confinement and how someone had just drawn a super detailed dick on the glass? Hey Scuttlebutt!” He shouted to a human sized beetle dressed in a do-rag. “Where’d you get this story about the new transfer from?”
</p>
<p>
	“Whatsamatter, ‘Grim?” Scuttlebutt chuckled. “You got all those machine parts and no wifi? I got the news from Yamamma.”
</p>
<p>
	“Buggy little prick,” Hallgrim muttered, before talking to someone on the next table over. “Hey Yamamma, what’s the word on the newbie?”
</p>
<p>
	“Go have a word with Deeznuts.” Yamma said, flipping Hallgrim the bird.
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim sighed and got up to speak to another man in the lunch line. “Yo Deeznuts…
</p>
<p>
	About 10 minutes and 7 humorous exchanges later, Hallgrim returned to the table with a Snailaxian crim called Harry Johnson and pointed him to Oryx. “Tell Gator boy what you just told me, Johnson.”
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t like being pulled outta the lunchline, because I gots the rumbly tumblies?” Johnson asked.
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim cuffed Johnson around the head so hard, he zipped back into his shell. “No you cretin, about the prisoner.”
</p>
<p>
	Johnson slowly pushed his head out of his shell, his long antennae based eyes still rolling around. “Well, I heard from my cousin on the transport that the newbie is a Reap terrorist.” 
</p>
<p>
	No sooner had the words left Johnson’s mouth, the door to the dining room opened up and a small woman was unceremoniously dumped on the floor of this all male prison. Scuttlebug licked at his proboscis rubbing his forelegs together. “Pretty little flower.” He muttered as other undesirables started circling around the woman.
</p>
<p>
	Quick as a flash she grabbed Scuttlebutt’s proboscis and pulled it to the nearest table, then grabbed a knife off the nearest dinner tray and nailed his snout to the table. After a few seconds of gasping and abject shock, four men rushed her. She hopped over a charging man who smashed face first against the door, making a Looney Tunes-esque sound of a ringing bell as he knocked himself unconscious. As she landed, she swept the leg of another one then made her knee ridgid, connecting with the falling crim’s chin with a sickening crack. Two left now. The Reap girl was still holding the dinner tray in her free hand, and as the next two approached, she threw it to the floor and used it as a skateboard, sliding to them so quickly that as they threw punches towards her as she passed between them, she was able to duck and dodge out of the way. It seemed as if the two men froze, kinda like at the end of Rocky III where they have that secret fight and the scene stops and turns to watercolours. Although after the two giants connected the only colour water on show was the red from their smashed faces, and the brown puddling around their feet as they both fell to the floor unconscious.
</p>
<p>
	The Reap picked up the tray, bussed it, and left the mess to find her cell, leaving a stunned group silent behind her. Hallgrim nudged Oryx. “So when are we planning on being beat to a pulp, then?”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Over the next few days, Oryx watched the woman from afar, with Hallgrim in tow not far behind. They witnessed an attempted attack where someone had tried to jump on her while she was sleeping, only for her to have set the springs of the cot up like a giant mouse trapped that closed on the would-be rapist’s junk, severing it from his body. They watched as she was punched on as she lifted weights in the Meat Zone and used a barbell to impale a man to the wall, then use the extra weight to finish her set. Then they tried to attack her in the showers, but she had raided the cleaning supplies cupboard and rigged the other heads with cleaning acid, turning three assailants into that guy from Robocop that gets pulped by Clarence Bodickers car.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx and Hallgrim both agreed - who the hell would send them after a lone Reap even one as brutal as her? The prison itself would get rid of a Reap soon enough, she couldn’t fend off these attacks forever. Hallgrim noted that she was starting to look tired, not being able to sleep for the last two nights.
</p>
<p>
	The two went to the library to retrieve the gun and cuffs, for all the good it would do. “Maybe Beppi will let us off when we explain the woman is a straight up killing machine?” Hallgrim offered, desperately.
</p>
<p>
	“Yes, Beppi has always seemed the reasonable sort.” Oryx nodded as they turned into the stacks.
</p>
<p>
	“Alright, smartarse, I was just trying…” Hallgrim stopped and put a hand to Oryx. There, lying dead, was Correctional Officer Damage. He had been shot repeatedly in the torso but had been dead a few days by the smell of him.
</p>
<p>
	“What preposterousness is this?” Oryx was flabbergasted and went to approach the body, but Hallgrim stopped him.
</p>
<p>
	“Well now I know you ain’t the big bad everyone thinks you are.” Hallgrim smirked at Oryx’s puzzled face. “Only a rank amateur would put their hands on a body they didn’t kill themselves. This is a frame job.”
</p>
<p>
	“Boopi Di Beppi?” Oryx asked, suddenly realising the puzzle pieces falling into place to reveal a picture of a jackass. “He wanted me gone because I’m a threat to his power.”
</p>
<p>
	The prison lights flicked off and on again, and Hallgrim clicked his fingers. “And he wants me dead because I know he has access to the security grid. He’s clearly causing these blackouts, and now he’s killed a guard. But why send us after the Reap if the guards will kill us anyway because of this sack of hate?”
</p>
<p>
	“To keep us busy.” Oryx muttered, angrier than he could remember ever being. “And if she killed us in the meantime, it just gave the guard more bodies to pick through while he…?”
</p>
<p>
	“Escaped in the chaos.” Hallgrim unzipped his jumpsuit and brought the computer's USB hub down to his crotch. When Oryx looked at him in disgust he shrugged. “Had some surgery to turn more John Thomas into a dual data drive and love making machine. Guards weren’t exactly going to check me down there, they’ve got a bad case of the ‘notgays’.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim accessed the prison database tenderly and gently. “Just like I thought, Beppi arranged for the Reap’s transfer here.”
</p>
<p>
	“Well then.” Oryx said, pulling the stun cuffs from the library book but leaving what was clearly a murder weapon next to the body. “Let’s go make an ally.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim overrode the cell door and knocked loudly on the barsl, eager not to become a dickless, impaled, blobman anytime soon. “Helllooooo? Reap lass? We come in peace.”
</p>
<p>
	“For goodness sake, Hallgrim, we don’t have time for this. Reap, someone is trying to kill the three of us, and we need to work…” Oryx marched into the cell and pulled back the covers, only to reveal a piece of paper with the words ‘Look Up’ written on them. He obliged, just as the Reap, who had been pressed to the ceiling like some freaky Spiderwoman, descended with what looked like a metal pole she had dislodged from her cot.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx caught the woman in mid air. “We’re here to talk!” 
</p>
<p>
	She slashed across Oryx’s face and he instinctively threw her. The force was such that she flew out of the cell, over the guard rail and down into the common area. The lights turned off, the emergency lighting glowing replacing it with a red glow, and the prisoners rushed to the door of their cells, hooting and hollering encouragement and obscenities. 
</p>
<p>
	Oryx jumped over the rail after her to try and calm the situation down, and Hallgrim ran to the stairwell, annoyed by their shows of athleticism.
</p>
<p>
	As the Reap woman tried hacking and slacking at Oryx with the pole, he grabbed it and threw it away, then grabbed her by the neck and threw her to the floor.
</p>
<p>
	“Will you just calm down!”
</p>
<p>
	ANNNNNND…you’re all caught up now. Our three…heroes are a stretch, so let’s call them simply ‘people’, are now surrounded by prison guards and have been framed for murder. Let’s check in with them, shall we…
</p>
<p>
	“This is what I was attempting to disseminate to you before you tried bombarding me with furniture.” Oryx found his back against the other two, trusting an enemy before ever trusting an authoritarian fascist force.
</p>
<p>
	“I had been told a Lizard and Robot would come for me.” The Reap said in her thick Veil accent that was vaguely Russian for some reason. “They said you were sending people against me.”
</p>
<p>
	“Told by Boopi Di Beppi, I reckon.” Hallgrim said, rolling his eyes.
</p>
<p>
	The Reap turned. “How did you know? The small man who smelled of marinara and sweat…”
</p>
<p>
	“Also told us we needed to kill you.” Oryx laughed. “But that’s why we came to talk to you. We need to work together to get out of here. Hallgrim, any way you can…”
</p>
<p>
	“I could quickly upload some tasteful obituaries, but apart from that, I’m fresh out of ideas.”
</p>
<p>
	“Ready.” The guards raised their rifles.
</p>
<p>
	“I wish I could say it was nice knowing you both, but it really wasn’t.” Hallgrim muttered.
</p>
<p>
	The Reap touched her ear, turning her head as if distracted. “Where have you been?”
</p>
<p>
	“Aim!” Said the guard.
</p>
<p>
	“Now would be preferable.” The Reap said as if to no one.
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim gave Oryx a look. “Great time for our badass Reap killing machine to go doolally!”
</p>
<p>
	The Reap turned to them with a smirk and got down to her knees “I would cover if I were you.” 
</p>
<p>
	Oryx ducked, and heard the sound of shattering glass, before a white light flooded the common area from the skylight above. The last thing Oryx remembered was watching as the guards, the Reap, and Hallgrim all fell to the floor as the flash hit them
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Oryx woke with a start in a comfy, red leather chair that was just the right level of worn by a roaring log fire. He nearly knocked over the small table that sat in front of him, that had a large tankard of ale atop it. He grabbed the glass and down the three pint contents in one long slurp, then looked around to find Hallgrim, the Reap girl, and another person similarly holding glasses.
</p>
<p>
	“Thought you’d never wake up.” Hallgrim patted him on the leg. 
</p>
<p>
	“What’s happening here?” Oryx slurred, still dozy from the stunning. “Where are we?”
</p>
<p>
	The Reap had her mask off, she was no older than 25, her face bordered by misshapen blonde bangs. Her face was dotted with scars, looking like she’d been through the wars. “Free, crocodile man, you are free.”
</p>
<p>
	The stranger put her tankard down “This is a place I found some years back. It’s called the Midpoint Inn. It’s on the outskirts of the Veil.” A great warhammer rested upon her lap, and she wore a platinum bear helm.
</p>
<p>
	“What would a Pillar of Ilima want with two cons and a Reap?” Oryx sneered, no lover of the Pillars after what they had done to the spliced.
</p>
<p>
	“The Reap is my friend, and you two were the only people in that prison that tried to help her.” Wrath said, draining her glass and putting it back on the table. “I could’ve spaced you both while you were unconscious, but she said you were innocent pawns.”

	Hallgrim sat straight, and cleared his throat. “Hey! I’m not innocent, I’ve robbed banks and participate in cyberfraud through the five sectors, I stole the Vashni diamond from Velit Pri…”

	Oryx pushed Hallgrim back in his chair. “My friend here has a penchant for deception and exaggeration. What he meant to say was thank you. Tell me how much I owe you for the libation and I will be on my way.”

	Hallgrim crossed his arms across his chest petulantly. “Figures. What do you want us to do? I’ve got a great singing voice, and Oryx here can give you a great interpretive dance lesson.”
