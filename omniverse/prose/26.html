<p>
	Lionel sat on the grassy bank, watching the recruits being trained by Fincher and Ondar. Grissom’s twinned childhood friends were excellent teachers who taught through action, not words. The muted pair imparting their survival tactics wisdom to a squad of about twenty. The twins looked much more at peace since they had met and fought on Pisneyland, now they had recovered from the torture and slavery at the hands of the evil Zaxxon Pisney. The group was growing fast, much faster than Lionel could’ve predicted. They had already run out of room in Kalandra’s Diplomacy and Ethics and Danarius’ Xenobiology classes, and Lionel now had nowhere to teach his References in Contemporary Earth Media classes but outside by the lake. It mainly meant him sitting on his own, watching and quoting movies by himself, but now he got to do that being eaten alive by lakeside bugs.
</p>
<p>
	“What are you looking at so ferociously? Someone’s not misquoting Jean Luc Picard are they?” Tamia smiled as she squatted next to him and kissed his cheek.
</p>
<p>
	He realised he had been watching a younger girl who was struggling with the drills that the twins had been teaching her. She had sat out the lesson and took a bench at the side in frustration or possibly sulkiness. He thought her name might have been Zilli, or Zinni maybe. He promised himself he would go check on her when they were back.
</p>
<p>
	“Just looking into a mirror.” He smiled. He looked up at his wife, his smile fading when he noticed the hand she used to wear Hijoki on was buried in her pocket. It had been seven years since they lost Hijoki, but she still subconsciously hid her hand away when she felt anxious - and this was certainly a day that would drag up old anxieties. She was carrying a bag of knitting, which she had taken up between her missions, and Lionel saw a small sock on her needles. She had done this shortly after his death, hoping that if she wore a sock on her hand for long enough that Hijoki would somehow find his way back to her. “You ok, Tam?”
</p>
<p>
	She followed his eyeline and stuffed the sock back in her bag. “I’m fine, Lionel. I promise. I thought you’d want to know that Grissom is touching down in about five. We got the yodel when he entered the system. Also we thought we saw him on long range sensors doing doughnuts around the Nebari nebula, but he was spelling out something with his antimatter exhaust.”
</p>
<p>
	“Let me guess, ‘Lionel’s a dick’?” Lionel smirked.
</p>
<p>
	“You should be so lucky.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel’s eyes stayed on the knitting bag. “He say if he settled that border dispute on Xanite?”
</p>
<p>
	Tamia hooked a finger under his chin and lifted it to her face. “He apparently tried chatting, tried partying, he even suggested they all get nude and wrestle it out. But once he put his gun on the table, those border colonist poindexters just agreed to it the moment he offered them a pen.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel shook his head. “It’s not really the way I want us to operate now.”
</p>
<p>
	Tamia wrapped her arms around his neck. “A fox can grow grey, but it can’t grow good. If you want diplomacy, you send Kalandra. If you want patience, you send Rorson. If you want a show of force and a  potential public indecency offence, you send Grissom. Unless you think we don’t need to show force?”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel chewed the inside of his cheek. “Not this again.”
</p>
<p>
	“Can’t avoid it forever, Lionel. This isn’t the Dukes of Lead anymore. The twins, Denarius, even I can accept that the universe needs a new way of doing things now. Grissom Graves can’t. You need to stop forcing a bastard shaped peg into a round hole because he’s your friend.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel got up and helped Tamia up too. “Maybe tomorrow. Certainly not today.”
</p>
<p>
	“Agreed. Let’s go welcome him home.” Tamia slipped her hand into her pocket and offered Lionel the other one. “And well done for not laughing at ‘round hole’.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel smirked. “What can I say, I’m all grown up now.”
</p>
<p>

	The ribbon was cut with the laser scissors and it fell to the floor in a pleasing manner, but with it Ludwig felt his spirits drop. It marked the end of a seven year journey to take his mind off things he had yet to address, and now there was no hiding. The applause drowned out his thoughts and he quickly smiled as Taber slithered over to him. He offered a tentacle, but Taber knocked it away and wrapped the Krakenite in a massive hug, pushing the air out of his lungs.
</p>
<p>
	“Careful, General. I’m not as young as I used to be. Anyways, you have a public image to keep up with.” Ludwig puffed.
</p>
<p>
	“Bullshit. Stuff we been through together they’re lucky we’re not rawdogging on the steps here.” Taber smiled. “And none of the General crap. Just because I’m a hero to these people doesn’t mean you have to treat me any differently.”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re the chief military leader to the Queen of New Ithia, it’s not crap, it’s respect.” Ludwig smiled.
</p>
<p>
	Taber looked out over the new city that Ludwig had been instrumental in creating. The spacedock, the library, the Protostarbucks so that everyone could say ‘let’s not go to the Protostarbucks, there’s a better coffee place in town’. New Ithia was a gleaming paradise of crystal, metal and organics. “What’s your next project, buddy? Strip club? Sexatorium?”
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig smiled. “Not much left for me to do here. I’m a freedom fighter. Omniverse is free.”
</p>
<p>
	A silence fell between the pair of them, before Taber broke it. “Haven’t seen Mooks in a spell. You know where she is?”
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig nodded towards the building next door to the extension they had just unveiled, the new headquarters of the Mothman Propheseers. “Where else?”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Mookie held the acolyte’s forelegs in their own shaky legs and tutted. The hair on the legs was singed and smelled awful, and Mookie looked up through their big spectacles at the young initiate and smiled. “What am I going to do with you, Fonder? You know the braziers are not for touching, but for seeing the way to the databanks.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m sorry, Mother Mookie.” Fonder whispered, near tears.
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t call me Mother, Mookie will do. You don’t need to be upset, little one. Many was the time as an acolyte that I burned my legs on braziers.” They got up with a creaking groan and opened the first aid kit on the wall to remove a roll of bandages from inside. Pain shot through their back - they were getting old.
</p>
<p>
	“Is it…” The mothling started as Mookie wrapped. “Is it true you were the Omniseer? Wallin and Freyto say you were the most powerful Seer the Propherseers ever produced.” At Mookie’s raised eyebrows, the youngling went on. “If you don’t mind me asking, what happened to you?”
</p>
<p>
	“Normally I would shout at young acolytes to get the hell out of my office and go back to their studies for rudeness like that.” Mookie sighed, and sat a little straighter as they finished up the bandaging. “But you have asked on a particularly important day. I burned out my powers to stop the literal representation of all sorrow, and saved the entire Omniverse at the cost of my soulmate. Now I teach small children who touch things they should not. There, you can go back to your studies now.”
</p>
<p>
	Fonder got up, looking behind her as she opened the door. “I’m sorry I asked, but there was no need to make fun of me.” She closed the door a little harder than she would have normally, leaving Mookie in the dark.
</p>
<p>
	“Kids, eh? You’ll never catch me having them.” Taber said as he slithered out of the shadows, catching the roll of bandages that Mookie dropped. “Partially because I’m the last of my species, but also because kids are more savage and cruel than a hundred Technomancers.”
</p>
<p>
	“Damn you Taber, you scared me.” Mookie hissed.
</p>
<p>
	“I thought there was nothing to be scared of anymore? Since we’re big, victorious heroes and all.” Taber laughed as he raided Mookie’s cabinet and found a bottle of Dankpit Dwarf Ale. “You were holding out on us, Mooks! You had this back on the Swiftfeather?”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie sighed. “I was keeping it for a special occasion. By all means, this is the best occasion in the year these days.”
</p>
<p>
	Taber put an arm round Mookie’s shoulder. His friend looked ancient, and he was reminded that moth lifespans were not as long as most humanoids. “It’s good to see you, Mooks.”
</p>
<p>
	They hugged him. “You too. I look around at all these children to remind myself why we fought, because we don’t seem to be getting much from it.”
</p>
<p>
	Taber was taken aback. “Mooks, we’re still alive.”
</p>
<p>
	“My point exactly.” Mookie pulled a metal cylinder from the desk, took Doot’s Keytar from its place on the wall, then turned to Taber. “Shall we go get Ludwig?”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Bar’Thur leaped high into the air and kicked the Harvester in the face, and as she doubled over in pain, Blotch lifted her cudgel hand to knock the woman’s head back. She fell to the floor in a heap. “‘Aven’t seen one of these in a fair whack.” Bar’Thur sat down on a log and inflated his throat pouch. “Nigh on two years now, I think. Nice to hunt Harvesters instead of mythological beasts for a bit”
</p>
<p>
	“Speak for yourself, I like hunting bloodsucking things with teeth and fangs. Sod’s law one’d turn up today.” Blotch tutted, holding the metal portal device in her hand. “Bloody Harvesters should’ve got the message by now.”
</p>
<p>
	Bar’Thur pulled his own metal cylinder from his pocket and clinked it to hers, in a toast of sorts. “Gotta do what needs to be done. It’s just a day. You want to see your friends don’t you?”
</p>
<p>
	“Course I do.” Blotch sighed. “Just brings it all back, you know? I’m scared of seeing that place again, of feeling that pain.”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s like I always say, lass. We need to take the time to remember the bleak bits.” Bar’Thur rose as the Harvester stirred and brought his axe down into the back of the murdering heap of metal and flesh, spraying blood and oil into the air. “Can’t always be this fun, ya know?”
</p>

<p>
	Heath sat cross legged on the Ithian plains they had beaten the Technomancer on all those years ago. He woke to his internal alarm and stood. He had not moved for over 300 days, and the grass clung to his body as he pulled away from the ground. He had been doing important work. Now he was the literal embodiment of the two diametric governing forces of the Omniverse, it was his job and his alone to move critical energies from reality to reality in order to keep the heat death at bay. It required intensely minute calculations that took 99% of his runtime, the other 1% being devoted to removing all trace of internet memes from existence. He felt it was the lowest form of humour, and even a previously emotionless robot could see that it was just recycling.
</p>
<p>
	But this day he could afford himself a break. He felt the Doots energies in him praise him for self care, and the Technomancer berate him for stepping away from his job to enjoy himself. He wondered if all humanoids felt like this, this constant cycle of contradictory dichotomy that almost seemed to paralyse all reason and decision making. Yes, Heath, the answer is yes, we’re all stupid idiots.
</p>
<p>
	The once dead plains of Ithia had been rewilded under his watch, and Ithia was now a solar punk world where nature and civilisation worked in harmony. He had re-risen the dead of this world using the native, ambient energies of the planet, and by their acts, they fed the energy of Old Ithia. It was neat, it was effective, it was a Final Fantasy VII rip off, but it made him happy to create new life and tend to it like a garden. He was aware that made him what organics might refer to as a god of sorts, but he would not let that thought have any credence, he was simply doing what needed to be done. He turned to the memorial, which had become overgrown with wildlife. With a turn of his hand, he absorbed the life energy of the plants and insects around the monoliths of rock and redirected it elsewhere. Was this how the quest for power started for the Technomancer he wondered. ‘Yes’ whispered the Technomancer energy. ‘No’ stated the Doots energy. Malcolm, the imaginary dog he had begun seeing swiftly put a hand up - he also had an opinion. Heath tended to ignore Malcolm, considering he was a clear and obvious sign of psychosis.
</p>
<p>
	“Nice to see you up and about. I thought you would be home for bees if staying there much longer.” Stoker came out of the treeline, holding six kegs of strong ale that the dead Ithians had made especially for the heroes of the Omniverse War. The ageless bug still hobbled after his beating at the hands of the Technomancer, and though his wings were still attached loosely, they hung limp from his shoulders like a beautiful patterned cloak - he would never fly again.
</p>
<p>
	“Hello Stoker. How have you been this last year?” Heath said.
</p>
<p>
	“I am enjoying unending life with zombie people. Lots to do, much time to do it.” Stoker placed the kegs down on the soft grass. “Were you not supposed to build hall for us to meet in? Peoples will be here in no times.”
</p>
<p>
	“Ah, yes.” Heath said, as he raised his arms. The ground shook as he drew from the particulates in the soil to build a magnificent meeting hall of stone and mortar that was erected in ten seconds.
</p>
<p>
	“Busting my back building this last year when he just pulls perfect buildings out of ground.” Stoker muttered as he took the kegs into the building.
</p>
<p>
	With the memorial tended, with refreshments already being transported by the inhabitants of Old Ithia, and the meeting place set. Heath sat and waited, not working, but devoting all runtime to anticipation of seeing his friends again.
</p>

</p>
<p>
	“C’mere, you piece of crap.” Grissom wrapped Lionel up in a bear hug, lifting him off the floor and damn near snapping every rib. Grissom kissed him on the head. “It’s good to see you, little brother.”
</p>
<p>
	“You too, Griss.” Lionel held him out at arm's length; he was looking old. His skin was lined at the eyes and mouth, and the black springy goatee he sported was now more grey than black. “Been a while.”
</p>
<p>
	“Getting the missions directly from Tam means I don’t have much time to come back to the barn.”  Grissom looked around, the Dukes of Lead compound had become almost like a college campus. While there were military-like drills, shooting practice, students under a tent were discussing the merits of social intervention and critical care, which to Grissom was entirely too much bullshit to devote any brain space to. “Looks different from my day.”
</p>
<p>
	“I know it might seem a little namby pamby to you.” Lionel said.
</p>
<p>
	“Not as namby pamby as a grown ass man using the term ‘namby pamby’.” Grissom smiled.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel ignored him and went on. “But the New Dukes need to be part teacher, part social worker, part diplomat, part protector. We need to help, not just to shoot first. Otherwise we’re just some fascist police force.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom raised a hand to stop him before he brought out a powerpoint presentation or soemthing. “There’s a reason I put you in charge, bud. I trust you more than anyone I’ve ever known. If there’s a man alive that was meant to do this, it’s you.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel stopped and turned to his friend. “That might be the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom looked down at Lionel then kept walking. “You got spinach in your teeth, kid, straighten up for Crom’s sake. Let’s go get Tam and see the gang”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel sighed. “I have to pick up a present for Mookie up from the lab first.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Blotch gasped as she stepped through the portal at just how green the planet had become. When they were last here, the ash in the air was so acrid it burned your throat, and the wildlife carried pocket knives and huddled around burning chariots. Now, the planet had been reclaimed by nature. With winding creepers passing through buildings and out of the old half destroyed wagons. From the portal she could see The Great Tree of Harrad’Netarr in the capital city of Etrus. When Hallie, Bar’Thur and Ria had fallen in battle against the Technomancer, the tree was dead, but now it was flourishing, the great structures built into the tree showing signs of busy activity. She felt herself sob. Her home was healed, and if not for the fact that this place carried so much sorrow for her, she could see herself returning.
</p>
<p>
	“Weird, right?” Taber slid in next to her. “You can never come home again, and not just because your dad caught you doing something questionable to a sofa cushion.”
</p>
<p>
	She turned and gave him such a hug that he had to reduce in size. All her worries about returning, all her anxiety, melted away to be replaced by love. “It’s so good to see you, you slithering puddle of black jizz.”
</p>
<p>
	“That’s no way to treat a military leader.” Taber laughed.
</p>
<p>
	“Wouldn’t let you lead me to the buffet cart, Tabes.” Grissom whispered behind him, and Blotch and Taber embraced him, Lionel and Tamia in turn. Grissom was as rugged as ever, but the years were starting to take their toll, Tamia was just as beautiful as she always was but it still hurt to see her without Hijoki. She was staring at the monument,  Lionel was a man now, and not like the pissant little man child he had previously been. He held himself differently, filling the space as if he owned it. He reminded her of a younger Grissom.
</p>
<p>
	“How are you guys doing? How are the New Dukes?” Taber asked.
</p>
<p>
	“Tiring.” Lionel said. “But rewarding. Always spots for you two there.” He knew it was futile to offer, he asked them every year, but there was a part of him that felt if he could get them all together again it would fill the unease in his heart.
</p>
<p>
	“I wouldn’t leave Bar’Thur again.” Blotch said. “To be honest, we’re having so much fun hunting monsters in his reality that I couldn’t imagine doing anything else.”
</p>
<p>
	“Same.” Said Taber. “New Ithia takes up a lot of my time now. The General title is just for show, I’m mainly sorting out quarrels and putting things straight.”
</p>
<p>
	“Sounds like you're both New Dukes anyway.” Tamia said, still looking at the stone structure. “It’s not surprising. We all know what was sacrificed to get us here, none of us want to lose it now it’s here. It’s too important for us not to spend the rest of our lives helping others.”
</p>
<p>
	They all looked at her, wondering if she was truly ok, but Tamia turned to smile at them. “You all need to stop worrying. The Omniverse is safe, and we’re all happy. You’re all waiting for the other shoe to drop, but it’s not going to. We’re safe. We won.”
</p>
<p>
	“Couldn’t have said it better myself, Tamia.” Ludwig said from the open door of the lodge, Mookie and Heath behind him. Stoker sprawled out of the lodge, beer in hand and flew directly into a nearby tree to be alone.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel gasped. Mookie looked so old, their fur now more white than brown. Though their frame was still lithe and thin from the transformation, Mookie walked with a hunch, and held Heath’s arm as they walked. Lionel almost sprinted to them, kneeling down and wrapping his arms around them.
</p>
<p>
	“You put some meat on those bones.” Mookie whispered. “It suits you.”
</p>
<p>
	“You look..” He began.
</p>
<p>
	“Old?”
</p>
<p>
	“As cool as you always did.” Lionel finished, squeezing them tighter. He leant in to whisper to Mookie’s ear. “You saw all these futures, now we’re living in one. Doesn’t quite feel real does it?”
</p>
<p>
	“I knew you’d understand.” Mookie said.
</p>
<p>
	“Heath.” Grissom nodded.
</p>
<p>
	Heath nodded in return. “Mr Graves. Before you ask, there have been no murderous urges or Technomancer appearances. He is at peace inside me.”
</p>
<p>
	“How can you be the same person?” Blotch asked. “If you have all those Doots and Technomancers inside?”
</p>
<p>
	“I suppose it is much akin to all those voices you have inside yourselves, telling you to be good, or take a risk, or hold the line. It takes a lot of control, but I feel much more balanced, much more real now.”
</p>
<p>
	“So long as you aren’t feeling the urge to ‘really’ skin us, then I’m happy for you buddy.” Taber patted him on the back.
</p>
<p>
	“Still doesn’t feel right does it?” Tamia stood in front of the memorial, a sculpture of a stone watch, keytar and sock springing from a central stone plinth. “Them being here and not us?”
</p>
<p>
	“There was a small part of me that felt we would all make it through, regardless of the danger we were in. As if we had some sort of plot armour or something. The Lords are cruel though.” Ludwig rested a tentacle against his chin. “I miss them, Tam.”
</p>
<p>
	“Me too. They were such a big part of my life, even for a short time. Hijoki wasn’t the only family I lost fighting the Technomancer. Ellie and Doots are always there, shining points in my mind.” Tamia ran her hand over the bag of knitting.
</p>
<p>
	“I miss you guys as well.” Ludwig said sadly.
</p>
<p>
	Tamia knelt down to Ludwig, who was straightening his waistcoat. “You can come back and live with us? You’re always welcome.”
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig smiled. “I guess I wonder if they knew we were going to win. I hope they didn’t die worrying about us.”
</p>
<p>
	“You said there was a part of you that thought we’d all make it. I know my father felt the same. They all knew.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom, Blotch, and Taber stood next to them in silence. None of the three were good at this performance of mourning. Grissom would much rather go out and get a drink or find a willing bed partner after someone had died. To remind himself he was still alive, not because he was aroused by the dead. He needed to feel something  other than sad; they had all experienced much too much sadness.
</p>
<p>
	“What’s up with Stoker?” Blotch said, looking over her shoulder at the moth. He was on a branch, leaning his back against the trunk, and had drawn his knees up to rest his head on them.
</p>
<p>
	“Maybe he feels conflicted.” Taber offered. “Doesn’t want to bring us down, but what made us special when his family lost? Must be fucking tough.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel stood with Mookie and Heath, not really knowing what to say, other than he missed his friends. These yearly meet ups were getting more difficult each time. In some ways, they were stuck in this place, never moving, never changing. A multiverse surrounding them, but unable to climb out of this gravity well. He spoke suddenly, not realising what he was going to say until it blurted out. “This is the last time we should come here. If we don’t move past this, then we didn’t end this sorrow and all our sacrifices were for nothing. I want to see you all without this hanging over us. Our story is done, and we need to let go.”
</p>
<p>
	“Agreed.” Tamia said, gesturing to Hijoki’s statue. “I carry my father in my heart, along with Doots and Ellie. I don’t need a place anymore.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie sobbed. “I can’t keep seeing her like this, it’s not what she’d want. It’s not her.”
</p>
<p>
	Stoker flew down and landed with an unceremonious thump at Mookies feet. “No. I will not have it. You deserve to be happy, all of you. You loved these people, just as I loved my own yous. Fires that burn bright last shorter amount of time. We, and we alone know that time is flat circle. Eventually all of us might be here again, together. And we celebrate that. You all saved me, and we saved a universe of universes. We killed sorrow. Let’s not bring it back to life by moping.”
</p>
<p>
	“Am I stupid or did what he said make a lot of sense?” Ludwig asked.
</p>
<p>
	Stoker turned his head to one side and vomited all the ale he had drank over the past day, along with a whole fish skeleton, into a patch of dry grass by the memorial.
</p>
<p>
	“Your prophet, sir.” Taber bowed towards Stoker.
</p>
<p>
	Lionel gestured to Heath and removed a small cylinder from his pocket and gave it to his friend. “Heath, Ludwig and I have been working on something for you.”
</p>
<p>
	Heath extended the cylinder, the small shape extending into a full telescope with a thin-legged tripod. He placed it down, then checked his internal chronometer, then orientation, before turning the telescope and bending down to it. “Ah, there we are.” He gestured to Mookie. “Prepared to do some time travelling?”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie looked to Heath with suspicion and then bent to peer through the telescope. There, in the centre of the image, was the shining, moving, sleeping body of Doots. She lay in a foetal position, surrounded by a vast, colourful emptiness. She was so bright against the background, so luminous that she even lit the dark shape of the Technomancer  lying alongside her. Mookie pulled herself away from the viewer. “How?”
</p>
<p>
	“It takes about a second for light to travel to your eye from your typical moon. That means you’re not really seeing the moon, but it's echo from a second ago. The further afield we look, the further back in time we see.” Lionel said proudly.
</p>
<p>
	“It started as a project Lionel gave us to try and prevent a historical event.” Ludwig shrugged.
</p>
<p>
	“I just think it was a mistake for Lucas to sell Star Wars to Disney, alright? It wasn’t long after they bought those nuclear codes and started war on Earth.”
</p>
<p>
	Heath nudged Lionel. “What you are seeing is the Recombination, the period about 400,000 years after the Universe was reset. When light and ordinary matter decoupled. When Doots and the Technomancer were truly born.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie stared at the telescope, then back at her friends, crying freely. “This is amazing. I can see her one last time. She’s at peace.”
</p>
<p>
	“She is.” Lionel nodded.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	The crew retreated to the lodge, where way too much reminiscing, drink, food and laughter was had. There was a vaguely ‘last time’ feeling around the celebration, and when it was time to say goodbye the next morning, no next meeting was arranged.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom sidled up to Stoker as they walked to their disembarking point. “Our agreement?”
</p>
<p>
	Stoker nodded. “Watching over metal fiend inside metal friend?”
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah.” Grissom nodded. “Not needed anymore. Heath has it covered. It’s taken a while, but I gotta admit the robot has earned my trust.”
</p>
<p>
	“I will stay, watch over him and make sure Heath himself stays ok. If peoples find out what treasure he has inside, they could try crack him open like nut. If they try, I crack their nuts.” The two shared a fist bump.
</p>
<p>
	They arrived at the plains and turned to Heath, who simply asked, “Who first?”
</p>
<p>
	“I wanted you all to know together, I’m going back home.” Ludwig said, not making eye contact. “There are many Krakenites who may need help freeing themselves from the slavery our Technomancer put in place.”
</p>
<p>
	Tamia, feeling a sting of guilt at her father’s actions, stepped forward. “The Dukes will help you with that. I got a candidate in mind who might need the chance to demonstrate a bit of force.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel smiled. “Griss, that sound good?”

<p>
	He turned to Ludwig, like a kid on Christmas morning. “Likely to be murder, dismemberment, or headbutting opportunities?” At Ludwig’s nod, he gave a thumbs up.  “Spin her up, Heath. I got fuckos to kill.”
</p>
<p>
	“Still can’t convince you to come home?” Taber prodded Blotch, already knowing the answer.
</p>
<p>
	“Dude, I am home. You should come visit, their Taber is almost as obnoxious as you.”
</p>
<p>
	“Wow. You almost have me coming through with you. I will visit as soon as I can, got my promise on that.” Taber wrapped himself around her in a snake-like hug.
</p>
<p>
	The glowing portals of orange swirled into life, as the crew embraced and said their goodbyes. They felt like proper goodbyes to Tamia, and that in itself felt right. She loved every person and disgusting trash-eating giant moth here like they were the family she never had, the family she had desperately craved after her own parents were gone. But they had lives to live.
</p>
<p>
	Taber watched as Lionel’s crew and Blotch walked through their respective portals, and stared back at Mookie. “Not coming, Mooks?”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie shook their head. “Not quite yet. Tell the Propheseers I’m taking a leave of absence.”
</p>
<p>
	Taber rushed to Mookie, giving them the squeeze of their life. “I love you, little bug.”
</p>
<p>
	“I love you too.” They whispered.
</p>
<p>
	He slithered through the portal, unable to look back. Once they had closed, Heath stood with Mookie in the clearing. “I take it you want to take another look through the telescope?”
</p>
<p>
	“No, I wouldn’ be able to use it again without breaking. But I do want one last thing.” Mookie said as they pulled Doot’s keytar from behind them and passed it to Heath. “She’s in there with you, isn’t she?”
</p>
<p>
	“Yes. Doots loved you very much. I feel it every day.” Heath said, sitting cross legged in the grass by the memorial.
</p>
<p>
	“Play for me. Please.” The old moth said, laying down on the ground at Heath’s feet.
</p>
<p>
	Heath began to pluck at the keytar, seemingly discordant notes that at once harmonised. It was a tune Heath did not know until he recognised that the tune was something Doots often played for Mookie when they would share nights together. It was soft and firm, melodious and stark, it was everything that the best relationships are and were.
</p>
<p>
	Mookie closed their eyes and reached out with their senses in a way they hadn’t dared in years, using what was left of powers they had burned away. Mookie felt nothing, a long tunnel of dark with her at one end, alone and empty. And then, a light appeared, soft and comforting. A golden hand probed out of that light towards Mookie. “How?” Mookie said, fresh tears running down their face.
</p>
<p>
	Who the hell said the cycle we destroyed was the only one? The voice said. I need a partner for the next adventure, you game?
</p>
<p>
	“Yes.” Mookie whispered, and took the hand.
</p>
<p>
	Heath finished playing, flooded by emotions he had never felt before. “I’m sorry Mookie, what did you say?” He reached down to Mookie, but his friend wasn’t breathing, wasn’t moving. “Mookie?”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie, Omniseer of the Mothman Propheseers, was still, a wide smile plastered across their face.
</p>

<p>
	“You think we’re doing the right thing with the Dukes?” Lionel said as he stood on the verge, watching the same group of kids he watched the day before. The same girl was having problems with her defensive form, and getting frustrated.
</p>
<p>
	“I think a problem needs a hammer. But a lot of the nails are gone now, Lionel. I dunno what you want me to say.” Grissom noticed that Lionel was only half listening, and was watching the group of kids that were being taught combat manoeuvre by the twins. “You listening to me, shit for brains?”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel lifted a hand. “I am, I just…” The girl who was having problems moved to the bench again, and put her head in her hands. He started walking down the hill towards her, calling back to Grissom. “Gimme a second, Griss? I just need to help this kid out.”
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, yeah. I’ll be here.” Grissom said, watching Lionel run down the hill, before picking up his bag and turning towards the Conveyance of Grissom Graves 3. Tamia was standing there, hand in pocket, knitting bag across her body.
</p>
<p>
	“You are a terrible liar, Grissom Graves.” Tamia said.
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t start.” He said as she joined him in the walk back to the ship. “Lionel doesn’t need my opinion. He’s got a good compass - he’s got heart, and he’s got you. Kid’s so much like Emmeth it hurts to be around him sometimes.”
</p>
<p>
	Tamia sighed as they approached the vessel and Grissom started loading the ship up. “I know, he needs to cut his apron strings from you, I told him as much. He loves you though. I think it bothers him that he doesn't see you as much anymore. The two of you were the Bonnie and Clyde of the universe for a while back there.”
</p>
<p>
	“I just need to put some distance between me and Lionel so he isn’t always asking my opinion, he’s a much better teacher than I ever was. Plus, there’s a universe of mess out there that needs tidying up. But I won’t be far off.” Grissom threw his bag into the hold. “You think I won’t be back when my nephew is born?”
</p>
<p>
	Tamia was white as a sheet, stopping dead in her tracks. “What?”
</p>
<p>
	He turned to her, smirk on his face. “I clocked the knitting. Lionel and the others were thinking you were knitting another Hijoki, but those socks are way too small. He hasn’t put two and two together yet, has he?”
</p>
<p>
	She laughed. “You remember who we’re talking about? Plus I’m only 5 weeks along, didn’t want to jinx it.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom smiled. “I’m happy for you both, but won’t this impact your life of backflips and decapitations?”
</p>
<p>
	Tam looked horrified. “You think I’m the stay at home mother type? Lionel can play wet nurse while I’m bringing home the bounties.”
</p>
<p>
	She hugged him, and despite his hatred for public and private displays of affection, he squeezed her back. “I’m proud of you both, and I know that Hijoki would be even prouder.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	“Yep that’s it, then lift your elbow, and then square your hips. You’ll get more power in the block.” Lionel nodded, smiling at the girl’s form.
</p>
<p>
	She thrust with the blade, then sighed at her lack of power. “I just can’t get it.”
</p>
<p>
	“You will, Zilli. Took me a long time too. Grissom said I had the form of a dead goose being fucked by a mangle when he first started teaching me.” Lionel took a deep breath, remembering how irritated that old bastard had made him. “And if you don’t get it, that’s ok. We have a whole ton of roles at the New Dukes. Just ‘cause you might not be able to use a blade, doesn’t mean you can’t help people in a thousand other ways.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’ll keep practising.” Zilli smiled. “Thanks, Mr Richie.” She ran off to rejoin the lesson, Ondar giving him a thumbs up in thanks.
</p>
<p>
	“Mr Richie? Fuck, she just killed you, lack of form or not.” Tamia bent down and put her arms around his neck. “I warn you, if you start to go senile, I'll put a pillow over your face.”
</p>
<p>
	Engines roared overhead as Grissom’s ship departed to meet Ludwig. Lionel looked up and watched the ship break atmosphere with a characteristically noisy bang. He smiled, wishing his friend well, then stared out into space for a minute or so, thinking about how many other versions of him might be out there, thankful for the fortunate life they had been given.
</p>
<p>
	“Hey.” Tamia whispered. “Where are you?”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel smiled, and rubbed the arm that was wrapped over him. “I’m just like you, Tam. Just like Taber, just like Mookie, Like Doots and Blotch, Grissom and Heath. Ludwig, Hijoki, Ellie.” He sighed a contented smile, everything was going to be ok.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m everywhere.”
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
