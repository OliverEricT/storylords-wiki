	Episode 24: You Can Never Go Home Again (But You Probably Should, Because The Technomancer Is There)
</p>
<p>
	Prompts: Ice and Monoliths

	Tamia jumped onto the bonnet of a passing transport, then propelled herself up in the air to wall run off the double decked community vessel. She used the scaling claw Ludwig had made her weeks ago to dig and hold onto the side as it slowly crawled down the busy public highway. The advert next to her showed a reclining woman in a swimsuit and sunglasses holding a meal replacement drink.
</p>
<p>
	“This is intolerable.” Hijoki declared, shouting against the mid morning rain, it always rained here. “How do these people stand for being so insulted all the time? I’m always bikini body ready!”
</p>
<p>
	“You’re a slightly greying sock, you have no place on the beach.” Tamia smiled.
</p>
<p>
	“Where the hell would you store your money and keys?” Hijoki looked aghast as Tamia vaulted to land atop a passing medical transport. There it was ahead of them, their target.
</p>
<p>
	“Well, Lionel naturally hates the sea, sun and sand, so he could watch it while I swim.” At Hijoki’s hurt grumble, she kissed the old sock atop his head. “Of course we’d take you, you grumpy old foot-fetishist.”
</p>
<p>
	Their quarry turned off the main concourse and stopped, so Tamia jumped to the light pole, swinging around it before leaping into the air and landing a perfect dismount. As the courier stepped down from his vessel, Tami grabbed him by his shirt and pinned him to the side of the transport. “You inept fool. I have been waiting for that delivery all morning, and you didn’t even knock at the door. Where is your honour?”
</p>
<p>
	The courier was trembling. “I…I pushed the bell, darling.”
</p>
<p>
	“You mean the bell that says ‘out of order, please knock loudly’?” She eyed the side of his conveyance. “UPS. Does that stand for Unorganised Pointless Shitbirds?”
</p>
<p>
	“Tamia!”
</p>
<p>
	She turned to the voice, to find Lionel in a suit and tie. He was staring at her, incredulous, along with everyone else walking down from London Bridge Station.
</p>

<p>
	Mookie lay breathless on their front atop the plateau, looking out into the nebula of this reality they called the Edge of Forever. It was a beautiful pinkish-green cloud-like nebula that vaguely looked like groups of dogs doing it in their natural style. It was an uncanny resemblance, and Mookie felt second hand embarrassed looking at it. Mookie looked away, down at their new forelegs, the lithe femininity of them that made her feel just as uncomfortable as the dog orgy nebula, or ‘dorgy’ as it were.
</p>
<p>
	“Still not used to your new body, huh?” Doots sat naked next to them, running a finger up Mookie’s spine with the sound of a xylophone going down the scale. Doots could make music out of anything with those fingers.
</p>
<p>
	Mookie turned to her with a smile. “You seem to be enjoying it.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots picked up her Keytar and started plucking at the strings, changing the nebula’s colours to vivid reds. “Me wanting you isn’t anything new. You were, are, and always will be beautiful to me, Mooks. You being comfortable is the most important thing.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie sighed.
</p>
<p>
	“What is it?” Doots asked.
</p>
<p>
	A shadow fell over them. “Don’t mind me, I am just catching sunbeams.” Stoker plonked down next to them, rolling out a beach towel and slathering sunscreen over his hairy insect body.
</p>
<p>
	“Stoker!” Mookie said as they grabbed their robe, Doots using her keytar to hide her modesty.
</p>
<p>
	“What?” The atlas moth seemed oblivious, before he noticed their nakedness. “Ahhhhh. Don’t worry little pinheads about it, I am not offended by brazen nudity. When you’re billions of eons old and madder than a box of boomer conservatives angry at hypothetical situations of their own making, you have sexual drive of taxidermy snail. On a long enough timeline, we’re all asexual, believe Stoker.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots kicked angry  at his sunscreen bottle, which left the gravity of their asteroid and floated into space. “We wanted some quiet time.”
</p>
<p>
	“No, you wanted the sexing time. I calculated you’d need no longer than 20 minutes as is optimal for the romantic sex. Was I wrong?” Atlas shrugged, looking over his sunglasses.
</p>
<p>
	Doots and Mookie looked at each other, feeling abashed by his accurate but wholly inappropriate assessment of their sex life.
</p>
<p>
	“Just ignore me, it will be like Stoker am not here at all.” Stoker said. “So what is it, Mookie?”
</p>
<p>
	The pair looked at him with puzzled expressions, so Stoker explained. “Mookie made this noise…” he sighed mockingly. “And you asked what was wrong. I was putting you back on track from before I interrupted. You’re welcome. I am invisible now.”
</p>
<p>
	Mookie went to talk, but Stoker put his foreleg up. “Before am turning invisible, do you have beer for Stoker in that cooler…”
</p>
<p>
	“No.” They both said, hoping their expression would warn off any further interruptions.
</p>
<p>
	Stoker waved at them dismissively. “So rude to poor Stoker.”
</p>
<p>
	Doots shook her head and looked over at Mooks, who was pulling their robe back on. “I feel bad. That we’re enjoying ourselves while the rest are…”
</p>
<p>
	“Stop. We all agreed, time off, and no pressure to return if we couldn’t face the fight. Those that want to talk about next steps can be at the rendezvous tomorrow. Fighting the literal embodiment of all despair and loss in the multiverse was taking its toll, we just lost Ellie. We had to strike a…balance.” Doots grabbed Mookie’s confused face in her hands and squeezed. “Oh, Mooks, that’s it!”
</p>
<p>
	Stoker sat up and pulled his sunglasses down. “You find beer after all?”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	The Harvester lifted an arm and fired, but instead of laser it fired out bubbles to a little tuneful medley. “Fucking cheap modder chop shops!” he cursed to himself.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh no, bubbles, my one weakness that hasn’t been revealed until this episode!” Taber shouted from the shadows.
</p>
<p>
	“Really?” The Harvester smiled.
</p>
<p>
	“No, you fucking donkey, of course not.” Taber pounced, straight into the Harvester’s other raised arm. His hand rotated back into his arm to reveal a butterfly knife, which sunk into Taber’s inky black torso. “That, on the other hand, did hurt. Man…‘on the other hand’.” He chuckled. “And people say I’m stoic and nasty.”
</p>
<p>
	Taber turned the mass of his torso into a giant chomping mouth which bit clean through the Harveter’s wrist. The man howled in pain, pulling away a bleeding stump.
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, dunno where they got that from!” Blotch emerged from the brush behind them and jabbed the Harvester in the guts with the edge of her cudgel, as Taber spat up the Harvester’s dismembered hand and offered Blotch a high five with it, which she turned down immediately.
</p>
<p>
	“Who are you guys?” The Harvester wheezed, grasping for the pistol from the front waistband of his trousers. Grissom emerged and grabbed the hand, squeezing the trigger for him and shooting a bolt of hot plasma into the cyborg’s groin. The harvester screamed in agony, a blood curdling shriek, that prompted a smirk from Graves.
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t worry, they can mod a new one for you from the few pennies in my pocket. That’s all the metal they’d need to replicate your little chodey original, right?”
</p>
<p>
	As the Harvester looked up with fury on his face, Grissom kicked the man in the face, sending him to the floor.
</p>
<p>
	“One more down. So, what now?” Taber said as he wrapped himself around the beaten up Harvester like a boa constrictor and stood staring at Blotch and Grissom. Grissom was getting tired of the question. They had been in this reality for a month, helping this universe’s Dukes of Lead track down and hunt their Harvester criminals.
</p>
<p>
	“I catch your meaning, Tabes, but what’s left to do?” Growled Grissom. “We won’t catch him with his pants down again, will we?”
</p>
<p>
	The Harvester raised his eyebrows. “D…Do you mean me?”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch slapped their captive around the head. “No! Shut up, numbnuts.”
</p>
<p>
	Taber grimaced. “Don’t say ‘catch him with his pants down’, the Technomancer is billions of years old. I bet his shrivelled, ancient cock looks like an old man sucking a lemon.”
</p>
<p>
	“Well thanks. Done with that!” Blotch threw the drumstick she had been slowly absorbing in her internal acids into the deep forest to the side of the path.
</p>
<p>
	“How about we just go kill him, kill him until he’s dead, proper dead? Like deader than Gina Carano’s career.” Taber said.
</p>
<p>
	“You know we can’t do that. We’d all cease to exist.” Grissom said. “I get how you feel, no one wants that piece of diseased scrotum dead more than me, but for all we know he’s dying already.”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch scoffed as they walked through the forest, Harvester in tow. “You don’t believe that.”
</p>
<p>
	The Harvester cleared his throat. “Well…actually, our Technomancer was killed. To be honest it was a bit of a relief. I’d been kidnapped and forced to do her bidding, transformed into this abomination. Now she’s gone, I can do what I want.”
</p>
<p>
	“Including stealing those kyber diamonds that are in no way a copyright issue?” Taber squeezed, winding the Harvester.
</p>
<p>
	“I didn’t steal no ice, man. You got the wrong half humanoid-half killer cyborg. This is victimisation.”
</p>
<p>
	Blotch sauntered up to Grissom. “We sure this is the guy? I mean the warrant for a metallic villain from the Dukes was pretty sketchy. Description they gave us, we probably could’ve taken a smoothie maker into custody.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom chewed the inside of his own cheek, it was hard to disagree with her, but the way of the Dukes was to bring the body in and sort the shit out afterwards. The likelihood was that this scumbag cyber was guilty of something, right? The thought - his previously unshakable code - felt foreign in his brain, like a tumour or when religious people just follow a code written to honour their imaginary friend. “Let’s just finish this.” He muttered.
</p>

</p>
<p>
	“Steelsquid 2, this is Steelsquid 1.” Ludwig spoke over the pocket radio as he slithered through the air duct before dropping down into the hermetically sealed lab.
</p>
<p>
	“I was of the understanding that I was Steelsquid 1.” Heath was in the lab on board the Swiftfeather, standing in front of the monolith of technology the pair of them had created, wrestling with the burned out semiconductor that they needed to replace.
</p>
<p>
	“I told you that I was going to be number 1 this time.” Ludwig’s voice squawked back through the radio. “Plus, 1 is the loneliest number. I’m doing you a favour.”
</p>
<p>
	“I have it on good authority that 2 can be as bad as 1.”
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig swore under his breath. Damn Lionel leaving his spotify account unlocked for them, it had been a bone of contention for the pair. When they had all agreed to take a break from worrying about the Technomancer, Ludwig and Heath had chosen to stay in a reality where time moved slower and there were no lifeforms left, so as to complete their experiments. But six months together without their friends under such pressure had been difficult. But this day in particular was more stressful, they only had one day left to swipe the semiconductor, install it, do what they needed to do, and finish the last two episodes of Downtown Abbey.
</p>
<p>
	The lab was stifling with the typical white sterility of a lab, but the entire floor spreading out in front of him was coated in a thick layer of what Ludwig hoped was dust. “Heath, the lights if you please?”
</p>
<p>
	Heath quickly tapped into the facility’s systems and turned every halogen bulb in the place on, each one flickering on with a slow hum. And as they came on, Ludwig wished they hadn’t. At the end of the corridor, a gigantic monolith of hardware stood proud, with a long broadsword buried into it. The wielder of the sword still grasped the hilt in clasped hands, but had died hundreds of years ago, his skeleton wrapped in a blue half cape guilded with what was once golden thread. He wasn’t the only corpse in the room. Five metres in front of Ludwig a skeletal humanoid bull was slouched over a bank of computers, arrows sticking from his ribcage. Next to him, lay a small cherubic angel, wings still perfectly intact as if rot could never touch them. He reached for another skeleton, who clutched at his stomach, a long rifle draped over them.. Ludwig surveyed the rest of the room, gasping as he noticed a handle half buried in a pile of deactivated robotic soldiers. As he pulled it out of the rubble, he knew what it was instantly - the pistol of a Duke of Lead, or their equivalent. This was the last stand of this reality’s versions of them against their Technomancer. The scene didn’t exactly give Ludwig confidence, this reality was devoid of all life - had this battle caused that?
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig reached for the semiconductor from the giant tower of tech their Technomancer had been, trepidatiously pulling it from the base. “Heath, I’m coming home.” He whispered into his communicator as he walked to the air duct, not wanting to disturb this graveyard any more than he had, and wondering if this was a sign of things to come for them.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	“Tam, you can’t just assault people who annoy you.” Lionel sighed as he put his work bag down on the floor of the coffee shop. “This isn’t Ithia or Brackenfield Station, or a Walmart carpark. We’ve been here for eight months now, you don’t need to fight against everything.”
</p>
<p>
	Tamia slammed her katana down on the cafe table. “I need to do something, Lionel. I have tried to fit in on your alternate earth, but this planet is not for me. The people are obnoxious and stupid, believing that they are the only life in the universe.”
</p>
<p>
	“Some of them defy all reason.” Hijoki said. “Dogs in baby carriages, people who think gender is defined by their birth biology, recreational golf. It’s craziness! Fighting the Technomancer made more sense.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel turned away. “Don’t say that. We’re done, we came here to be free of that, the fighting, the guilt.”
</p>
<p>
	It was obvious what he meant, but Tamia was staying quiet. She knew how difficult this was for Lionel, he had been blaming himself for Ellie’s death a long time now. He wondered if by breaking up, had Ellie lost her last reason to stay with the crew and decided it was better to sacrifice herself? Either way, it had been Ellie’s decision, and he shouldn’t have felt bad. But grief had a way of churning up your insides faster than a caviar and cheese milkshake.
</p>
<p>
	“Maybe you should try work again?” Lionel suggested, even though his heart wasn’t in the statement.
</p>
<p>
	“I tried work.” Tamia muttered.
</p>
<p>
	“You were an emergency services responder and you kept encouraging people to take up arms against their assaulters, you prompted a two month crimewave in London and massive police reforms.” Lionel muttered.
</p>
<p>
	“Good! The police should reform, from being facists to being dead fascists.”
</p>
<p>
	“Nice one kid.” Hijoki made himself into a fist and Tamia fist bumped his head. “Thanks.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel scratched his head. Tamia had always cut his hair back on the Swiftfeather, but now he was back on a version of Earth, he had his hair cut by a barber. Lionel’s shorn bonce now looked like someone had hacked at it with a Harvester’s dismembered talons, and he rubbed at it whenever he was uncomfortable. “Ignore me, I’m just tetchy about this haircut. He cut it too short, it’s like looking into the future.”
</p>
<p>
	“From this angle it does resemble a crystal ball.” Hijoki sniggered.
</p>
<p>
	“Hush.” Tamia turned on Lionel. “What has happened? You were fearless, brave. You had become a formidable warrior. Now you’re doing customer services? What were you asked to do yesterday, Lionel? Say it loud so the audience can hear please.”
</p>
<p>
	“I was asked to clean public toilets.” he muttered.
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t know how you don’t kill half those assholes. Even Grissom Graves would not ask you to clean a stained toilet bowl after he used it. Why are we here, Lionel?”
</p>
<p>
	“Because I can’t lose you too.” He shouted, then cleared his throat. “Either of you.”
</p>
<p>
	“Thanks, kid. Was kinda feeling like a third wheel here.” Hijoki said.
</p>
<p>
	Tamia went to him and threw her arms around Lionel, burying his face into a chest so boobdacious that few had been lucky enough to get this close to it without regretting it and lamenting their lost fingers later. “You can’t protect us. We want to fight, we don’t want to sit in this reality, despite how comfortable life is here, despite all President Reynolds says about protecting citizens.”
</p>
<p>
	“President who?” Lionel narrowed his eyes.
</p>
<p>
	Tami threw him today’s newspaper. On the front page the British Prime Minister was shaking hands with Ryan Reynolds in the White House. He smiled that stupid smile he had, as if his entire being was vacant for the winter while his brain was vacationing somewhere sunnier. Lionel slammed the table and went into his room to grab a bag. “Let’s go. Fucking worse than the Technomancer here.”
</p>
<p>
	He pressed a button on a metal device which opened a portal in front of them.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	“I’m just saying, you expect a half cyborg with no work references to get a job…in this economy? Nobody will hire a half breed, the whole damn system is rigged.”
</p>
<p>
	The Harvester had been talking incessantly for nearly an hour as the rest of them waited on the uncomfortable wooden benches in the booking hall in the Dukes’ compound. They had been waiting an hour now
</p>
<p>
	“If you don’t shut up, I’m going to pull all your metal implants out just to make something to stab you with.” Blotch said. “How long is this judge going to take?”
</p>
<p>
	“Normally, the Dukes take turns to act as high judge, and the hearing is just a formality. We wouldn’t bring in crims unless they were already guilty.” Grissom said.
</p>
<p>
	Taber and Blotch shared a look. “That sounds a bit…fascy, doesn’t it?” Taber muttered.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom kept his mouth shut, unable to formulate a response. “No, it’s not like that…it’s just…we’re peacekeepers.”
</p>
<p>
	“Yeah, but who asked for you to keep that peace, fella?” The Harvester muttered. “Keeping is controlling.” The three looked at their quarry with narrow eyes, and the Harvester looked suddenly away. “Is certainly something that someone might say.”
</p>
<p>
	“Someone like you, skidmark?” Taber sneered.
</p>
<p>
	“No…no, certainly not me.” The Harvester muttered.
</p>
<p>
	The thick stone doors of the courthouse opened with a creak, and a bailiff in a long blue robe came out with a scroll and quill. “Harvester Jethro Jinx, and accompanying Duke contractors? You may enter the hall now.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom dragged the Harvester to his feet and pushed him past the attendant and towards the room, Taber and Blotch following. The four of them entered a large stone forum, bisected by a large, rising semicircular peak. Three black hooded judges sat at the peak of the stone crest,only their mouths visible. It was so metal that the simple sight of it would have made you start moshing and/or crowd surfing, even if you were at your granny’s cremation. They said that every time the Dukes made a decision in the courtroom, two gnarly dragons started making little dragon babies, and angels pulled out their double handled guitars and shredded until their fingers bled. Now Grissom thought about it, that probably wasn’t true.
</p>
<p>
	A white ring of light appeared in the centre of the room, and Grissom walked the Harvester into it.
</p>
<p>
	“Who brings a bounty to the Courts of Lead?” The lead judge boomed out into the cavernous room.
</p>
<p>
	“Taber the Darkling, Blotch the Jeleskeleman, and Duke of Lead, Grissom Graves.” Grissom said, eager for all this pageantry to be over.
</p>
<p>
	“That’s impossible.” The middle judge said, pulling his mask down. “Grissom?”
</p>
<p>
	“Emmeth?” Grissom looked up into the eyes of his very own, slightly older than he expected, variant of his brother.
</p>
<p>
	“I watched you die, Griss.” Emmeth jumped down to the stone floor to embrace Grissom, the two men hugging for what seemed like both an instant and an eternity. “When I was ten, you…you died in that tragic speedway accident.”
</p>
<p>
	“He’s not your brother, he’s another version of him. Get with the programme, you dumb cop.” Jethro said, only for Emmeth to turn towards him. “I mean, not guilty, your honour.”
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth held Grissom at arm’s length to look him over. “It’s amazing. How have you people traversed the omniversal barrier?” He shook his head, realising where he was before clearing his throat. “A conversation for another time. It’s time to sentence the prisoner. Death awaits the guilty.”
</p>
<p>
	As Taber and Blotch stared at Grissom in disbelief, Emmeth stepped up to the crest to retake his seat with the other judges. Had it always felt like this, or had Grissom’s time with Lionel and the others somehow awoken him to what the Dukes of Lead truly were - fucking cops. Grissom shivered.
</p>
<p>
	“Do we have a sentence?” Emmeth asked.
</p>
<p>
	The first judge turned his chair away from the criminal. “Guilty.”
</p>
<p>
	The second judge did similarly. “Guilty.”
</p>
<p>
	Emmeth pulled his hood back on and turned his chair. “Guilty. The accused will now be summarily executed, as written in the Doomscrolls of law set out by the original Dukes of Lead, may their heads motorboat forever on the heavenly bosom for all eternity, and their guns never rust. Will you take the prisoner to the cells, brother?” Emmeth’s words echoed through the hall, and when the resonant decree had fallen silent, no response came back. “Grissom?” He called, but nothing came back.
</p>
<p>
	“Griss..?” He pulled his hood back off and turned around to find an empty hall. They had gone.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	“There, cuffs off.” Blotch said as she let Jethro Jynx free, and the Harvester scampered three steps before looking back.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m not fooling ya, for a second am I?”  He smirked at them.“You want the ice?”
</p>
<p>
	“Call it payment for breaking you out.” Taber slithered over and held out a hand.
</p>
<p>
	Jethro pressed a pectoral which swung open to reveal a secret compartment full of small pouches. He removed one, then emptied it into Taber’s waiting hand. “I pinched ‘em, but I didn’t cause anyone harm.”
</p>
<p>
	“Only those that had to smell your breath, Jinx.” Grissom’s expression was flat. “Get going, there’s a transport we’ve been using that you can have. Stay outta trouble.”
</p>
<p>
	Jinx smiled and nodded, before running off into the forest. He would never commit a crime again, except 47 counts of petty theft and one of extra marital relations with a four slice toaster.
</p>
<p>
	Grissom pulled a small metal device from his belt and looked at this two friends. They nodded in unison and Grissom pressed a button. A golden circle widened in front of them, a doorway back home.
</p>
<p>
	“Hey Grissom,” the Darkling whispered. “Why do all the alternate omniversions of you die in some rad extreme sport? Are…are you the boring version of you, Grissom?”
</p>
<p>
	“Let’s go home.” Grissom whispered. He was happy to be leaving this place, the realisation of what he once was hung heavy on him.
</p>
<p>
	“Grissom? Grissom, did you hear my question?” Taber said as they stepped through the portal together. “Grissom?”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	“Oh you silicon monstrosity, why don’t you do your krakendam, job!” Ludwig stopped trying to force the semiconductor into the machine and hit the supercomputer they had been assembling with a ball peen hammer. He wiped his slimy brow with a tentacle, which just added more slime to his forehead.
</p>
<p>
	“Will destroying our handiwork offer you solace?” Heath chirped from the other side of the unit.
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig rolled his eyes. “No, but smacking your face in with a wrench might.” He muttered.
</p>
<p>
	“I am sorry?” Heath’s head poked around the supercomputer.
</p>
<p>
	“I said…” Ludwig struggled as he pushed against the semiconductor. “...why don’t you eat a steaming pile of…”
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig grunted as the semiconductor slid into the computer and switched on, its primary monitor showing a splash of green light. “Ahhh. I awaken.” It said. “And I am greeted by two new lifeforms to subjugate.”
</p>
<p>
	Heath and Ludwig shared a look as they stood to address the once Technomancer of this realm. “We are not denizens of this reality, I am happy to relay.” Heath said. “We are about to depart, but wanted your advice on options to stop other Technomancers.”
</p>
<p>
	The computer laughed deeply. “Why would I help you? I am evil personified. Malice reborn.”
</p>
<p>
	“Because, you code-heavy cockring, You’re running in a test mode, and we can switch you back off in an instant.”
</p>
<p>
	The computer audibly gulped as it ran a test to try and escape, but it was no use. “When I say evil personified, I really mean that I could change.”
</p>
<p>
	“Then change. We can leave you reactivated, if you tell us how you were beaten in this reality.” Heath demanded.
</p>
<p>
	“I was not defeated, limited speck. I was contained. The angel they called Doots, my opposite end of the equation, was able to develop a rotating, contracting firewall around me so complex it had me buried inside subsystems. I could not escape.” The Computomancer tested at the walls of this system, finding a small crack in the test system. “I had killed virtually all life by then, but in containing me, they stopped the universe from resetting so that I may begin again.”
</p>
<p>
	“How…unfortunate for you.” Ludwig tutted. “And if a Technomancer somehow absorbed all the other Technomancers of the Omniverse?”
</p>
<p>
	The Computermancer broke from the test environment, its cables wrapping around Ludwig’s throat as it shot a blast of energy that decapitated Heath instantly. “You mewling pestilence, daring to fight all sorrow across the Omniverse? You cannot kill us, only weaken and contain. You aim too high and you always, always lose.” He squeezed Ludwig’s neck until the Krakenite’s neck burst, oozing blood over the cabling.
</p>
<p>
	“Simulation Terminated.” A voice announced.
</p>
<p>
	The Computermancer dropped Ludwig and looked around, panicked. “What simulation? What is this farce? I won!”
</p>
<p>
	“I can understand your confusion.” A voice came over a radio. “But you most certainly did not.”
</p>
<p>
	Back in the lab of the Swiftfeather, Heath and Ludwig sat staring at the small screen that showed the simulation they had just run. “We set you up in a holosimulation located in a lab surrounding a dying star. A white dwarf about to supernova in another reality, one where the only inhabitants are interstellar dust mites that you could barely see, let alone do any real damage to.”
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig sat back in his chair, his upper tentacles behind his head. “And my boy, you performed spectacularly close to what we expected. Now we know theoretically what we need to do.” Ludwig held out a tentacle rolled into a fist. “Science bros?”
</p>
<p>
	“Science Brothers.” Heath fist bumped his friend, then hovered above a big red button. “Would you mind if I did the honours?”
</p>
<p>
	“But of course, my dear friend.”
</p>
<p>
	Heath closed the portal to the Computermancers curses, just as the star contracted, ready to blow. “Ahhhh. That was satisfying. Should we go home now?”
</p>
<p>
	Ludwig pressed the metal device Doots had made them, making a portal pop into existence behind the Swiftfeather. “Way ahead of you, dear fellow.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Lionel pooped through the portal with Tamia and Hijoki in tow, to find the others there already around the mess hall table on the Swiftfeather. The mood was sombre, but each of them smiled to see the three of them back on the ship. Tamia hugged Ludwig, and Blotch offered a high five to Lionel, who took it so hard he wobbled her entire frame. Taber patted Hijoki on the head, but he was doing a headcount.
</p>
<p>
	“Where are Mookie and Doots?” He asked.
</p>
<p>
	Floorboards squeaked behind them, and they turned to find Stoker in a far too small for him, borrowed, pink, fluffy bathrobe. He was retreating from the mess hall fridge holding a chicken leg in his mouth, and was carrying enough food for four people. “What? I get peckish when I am sad.” He turned his back to their questioning stares, his giant wings pulsing with anger. “They are not coming, they wanted opportunity to find selves, and left. I could not be so cowardly.”
</p>
<p>
	“What?” Tamia couldn’t believe it. “You’re wrong, they wouldn’t.”
</p>
<p>
	“We all had the option to bow out, Tam.” Grissom was trying to see things from their point of view, but was failing. “They took it.”
</p>
<p>
	Lionel was shell shocked. “Can we win without them?”
</p>
<p>
	There was quiet around the table, as if the weight of their individual decisions to come back was now a crushing presence on the ship. Taber spoke first. “Could we have won with them anyway?”
</p>
<p>
	“Doesn’t matter, does it?” Blotch smiled. “I don’t want to live in a universe where we didn’t try and stop him. ”
</p>
<p>
	As everyone nodded in agreement, Lionel felt a rush of pride at being back amongst them. They were his friends, his family. Maybe not like brothers or parents, but definitely those weird cousins who you love but also wouldn’t want to spend too much time with. Though it dawned on him, this might be the last time they were all together, except Mookie and Doots of course. The feeling that they weren’t there was a white hot piece of metal burning in the pit of his stomach that he tried his both to push away.
</p>
<p>
	Heath leaned forward, his hands pressed together. “Ludwig and I may have found an option. We baited a Technomancer in another reality and were able to ascertain just how our alternate selves beat them. Containment.”
</p>
<p>
	“Bottled it up like a djinn.” Ludwig smiled. “We just gotta think of a suitable prison for the most powerful being in the omniverse.”
</p>
<p>
	“So…” Grissom said, pulling a laser pistol from his belt and spinning the barrel around (Some may ask why a laser pistol even has an old six shooter pistol barrel, and I say ‘because it looks cool’). “What are we waiting for?”
</p>
<p>
	Heath raised his hand. “No one has given the order, Mr Graves.”
</p>
<p>
	Grissom marched off grumbling something about hating robots and ruining pathos, and Blotch came and patted Heath on the shoulder with a chuckle. “Set a portal for Ithia. Let’s go die horribly.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer sat on the beach of what was - before he had razed it to the ground in a temper tantrum - the Dwarven resort town of Snarfholt, counting the volcanic black rocks. It was the only way he could keep sane, well, that and conversing with the weird talking dog that seemed to appear when the sun was at the highest point in the sky. Sometimes he was a dog, sometimes an indistinguishable black blob in his vision caused by lack of food, water, and sleep. He picked up the 67,433,632,785…no wait, 786th rock…then skimmed it into the water. He sighed a deep, teenage sigh and flumped down to the ground.
</p>
<p>
	“What’s up, Technomancer?” a voice said at his side. The dog, who had for some reason today wore a wide brimmed hat, wagged his tail and then broke off a piece of the hat, dipped it in the top, which was filled with melted cheese, and ate it.
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t know, Malcolm, I really thought they’d be here by now. It’s like I meant nothing to them. What has a nemesis got to do to be relevant nowadays? ”
</p>
<p>
	The Dog grew another leg and wrapped it around the Technomancer’s shoulders. “I’m sure they’ll be here soon, who could forget a hideous tyrant like you?” He grabbed the Technomancers chrome skull and shook it. “Now who’s my precious boy? Who is it?” The dog said in a singsong voice.
</p>
<p>
	The Technomancer looked at the ground, bashfully. “Is…is it me?”
</p>
<p>
	“The Dog pulled the Technomancer to his feet. “You’re damn straight it is, soldier. Now you pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and be what you were meant to be…a goddamned fabulous and genocidal son of a bitch.”
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly, above them, a golden window appeared in the sky in a flash. When it was gone, and when the light faded, the Swiftfeather hung in the atmosphere above. The Technomancer smiled, and clicked his taloned fingers. In response, hundreds of dead climbed out of the rocks around him.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh for…you messed up my count.” The Technomancer muttered, then smoothed his tattered cloak with his hands. “It’s been a thousand years since we were all together again. Let’s throw them a surprise party.” He whispered.
</p>
<p>
	THE END.
</p>
<p>
	Heath raised a finger. “It will not matter, by absorbing Ellie’s powers, he could just alter the destination of any portal we generate again.”
</p>
