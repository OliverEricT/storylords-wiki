</p>
<p>
	Wrath walked into the medbay on the Gloombreaker to find a still unconscious Asher hooked up to monitors, more wires around her than David Carradine on date night. One of those tubes was transmitting blood to Asher from an arm that hung over the chair next to the bed. As Wrath rounded the bed, she saw her younger self sleeping in the chair. Wrath glanced down at her own arm to see the various bruising from her own transfusion to her baby sister from a few days ago. 
</p>
<p>
	She remembered this night well, sleeping in that chair in her youth, arguing with her Wrath about what was to come. And when Wrath had finished arguing with her own younger self and left, she would have those memories from two positions, from two perspectives, like looking at the past through a kaleidoscope. It was enough to give her a headache. She found it hard to love Kellan, knowing that she viewed her with the lens we all view our child selves - abject horror at their music tastes, embarrassing disgust at their relationship choices, and cold sweats at every embarrassing decisions in life. She remembered her selfishness, her irrational nature, her temporary love of jorts, her lack of logic. Plus, who really loves themselves apart from narcissists, politicians, and Hollywood A-listers?
</p>
<p>
	“Is she going to wake up soon?” Kellan asked, no sound of sleep in her voice.
</p>
<p>
	“I knew you were faking.” Wrath mumbled as she sat on Asher’s bed and stroked her hand. “I honestly don’t know. Every version of the future is slightly different, this timeline even uniquely has a saturday night live cast that is actually funny. I can’t even remember most of what my Wrath told me when I was young, it’s like a game of Broken Telephone that repeats itself ad infinitum.”
</p>
<p>
	“Did you stab Asher when you were younger too?” 
</p>
<p>
	Wrath smirked. “Yeah. Little shit never shut up about it either.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan grimaced. “I’m confused, Wrath. Is this Asher your sister…or mine?” 
</p>
<p>
	“Yes.” Wrath said matter of factly. “Look, in reality, she’s your version that spent years in that Rift and has now come back. But when you’re my age, and you’ve lost as much as I have, you’ll love all Ashers just as much as the younger you does.”
</p>
<p>
	“So what about your Asher?” Kellan narrowed her eyes.
</p>
<p>
	“She’s…” At Kellan’s shocked face, Wrath held her hands up. “No, no, no, she's not dead, just unavailable right now.” She sighed. “Look. When I had this conversation twenty mumble mumble years ago with my Wrath, it turned into an argument I regretted. I felt angry that my future was written, I was bitter and hated her, and she was furious I was focusing on that and not putting the future right. I don’t want that relationship with you. It turns out that no matter how much I detoured from the path I wound up back here.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan smiled. “Well you look good for forty mumble mumble, maybe you can you share your skin care techniques?”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath laughed, the sound was almost alien to her. How long had it been? “Don’t, whatever you do, stop being a smartass and making people laugh. It’ll keep you going through the worst of this.”
</p>
<p>
	Kellan removed the drain from her arm and bandaged the puncture, then looked up at Wrath, offering a hand to her. “So partner, what’s next?”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath smiled. “Well, let me introduce you to the team.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	“So, she’s you? And you’re her?” Hallgrim squinted, noticing the similarities in the two women. “I feel like somewhere a picture of Marty McFly is fading out of existence.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx pushed his small spectacles further up his snout. “We were always taught the Rifts were doorways to Divine and Demon worlds.”
</p>
<p>
	Hum13, put his metal hands on his hips. “Even I - a devout, gods-fearing humanoid - deem that to be statistically untrue.”
</p>
<p>
	Wrath looked them over, the motley crew of weirdos that would someday become Kellan’s family, she felt so jealous that Kellan was starting this journey. “The Rifts are doorways through time and space. Only a few can open and close them.”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx gowled. “The Pillars.” He had put his hate for the Pillars aside to work with Wrath, but it remained there, bubbling under the surface like your average churchgoers racism, or Jimmy Kimmel’s justifiable self loathing. 
</p>
<p>
	Wrath put a calming hand out. “I know you want to talk about this, Oryx, and we will, but for now we need information on who these antagonists that are threatening the Amrays are. The further we get from my inception point on this timeline, the less useful the knowledge imparted on me becomes.”
</p>
<p>
	“I hear the best source of information is often the planetary information network. I however do not use it, as I am suspicious of all machines.” Hum13 declared proudly.
</p>
<p>
	Kellan stifled a giggle, before Hallgrim interrupted. “We can’t use the network anyway Hum13, you daft bucket of bol…erm…bones. The moment we tap in, anyone wanting to kidnap Kellan is gonna be on us faster than a white girl puts a flag filter on her social media profile pic after a war breaks out. We need a reliable source of information, not thoughts and prayers.”
</p>
<p>
	“I am confident there is an individual from whom we can collate the information we require.” Oryx huffed, two gusts of air exiting his nostrils that blew away the hairs that Hum13 had been gathering the last few days and glued to his chrome head. The robot whimpered at the loss and ran after them. “In all probability it will be reliable, even if the source is not entirely trustworthy.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim shook his head. “Fucking hell mate, do you mean who I think you mean? You’re having a laugh, they’re not gonna be best pleased to see us two.”
</p>
<p>
	“Sounds about as much of a sure thing as we can get.” Wrath nodded. “You three go, Kellan and I have some work of our own to do.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Big neon green letters shone in Hum13’s vision and he registered…read the words ‘The Snake Lounge.’ Next to the sign on the giant stone built building, in similar lights that nearly overwhelmed his optical…eyes, fluorescent tubes in the shape of a woman pulled a snake to her lips in two frames of animation.
</p>
<p>
	“I know exactly what this place is, but could you explain to friend Hallgrim what this is?” Hum13 said. He had dressed incognito, in a bright purple suit more at home on a 1970s pimp.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s a strip club, mate!” Hallgrim rubbed his hands together, his cybernetic eyes flashing in excitement. “Oryx, you should’ve told me we were coming here, I could’ve put my telescopic attachments on. Ribbed for their pleasure, you know?”
</p>
<p>
	Hum13 cupped a hand to his mouth, though he spoke in the same loud monotone to Oryx. “That joke was about his penis.” 
</p>
<p>
	Oryx ignored the robot and marched towards the door and the two burly security guards who bordered the entryway to the establishment. “We’re here to see Boopi Di Beppi.”
</p>
<p>
	“Fuck off, splicer.” One of the men, the stupider one, said.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, Dwayne, for fuck’s sake!” The other hit him in the arm. “You could’ve said ‘in a while crocodile’. It’s like we paid for those improv classes for nothing!”
</p>
<p>
	“Dwayne no mix day and night jobs!” Dwayne whispered.
</p>
<p>
	“You seemed to want to mix things up when you asked me to improv being a doctor last night.” Louis sulked.
</p>
<p>
	Hum13 stepped forward, his hands outstretched. “Fellow gentle-humans. I have had more than my fair share of lovers trysts in my 36 recharge cycles. The key to effective communication is a binary information share using quantum uplink methodology. I have a cable in my pocket if you would like to both plug in and settle this. Which port should I stick this into…”
</p>
<p>
	The last thing Hum13 saw was Louis pulling a stun pistol on them, and then he went into a deep offline state.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	A bucket of what Hallgrim sincerely hoped was water splashed over he and Oryx to wake them, while Hum13 was reactivated with a switch on his back. All three of them were cuffed, and as Hallgrim blinked the water from his eyes, he gradually registered the velour furnishings of a man with no taste and knew he was in Boopi Di Beppi’s office. The part shark Italian gangster - known to the press as the Spaghetti Strangler - had been instrumental in inadvertently getting he and Oryx out of prison whilst trying to frame them for murder as the little bastard escaped in the chaos.
</p>
<p>
	“Well, well, well. Didn’t expect to see youse fuckups anytime soon, especially not today. I mean, I intended to eventually come and kill you, but I didn’t anticipate youse two turning up on my doorstep, on this very day.” Beppi smirked, cigar in mouth. “It’s all very neat and tidy, like it’s my birthday or something.”
</p>
<p>
	“That analogy seemed oddly specific. Is it your birthday?” Oryx growled, his tail swishing back and forth. 
</p>
<p>
	Beppi, tucked a small party hat further into his pocket. “If it was, I certainly wouldn’t have expected any of my idiot henchmen to have bought me a present or card or anything.” Louis and Dwayne looked at each other with confused looks, and Beppi gave a sad sigh. It was then that Oryx realised he had a party horn and not a stogie in his mouth, and it honked loudly.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx shrugged at Hallgrim and went on. “We are here for information. We were hoping you would disclose the identity of who it is that is attempting to destabilise the political situation here on Ilima.”
</p>
<p>
	Beppi’s wide, dead smile became even wider as he paced to the wall where a ceremonial katana was mounted on the wall. It looked cheap and tacky, the kind of thing a 15 year old, future crypto bro would think demonstrated cultural respect. “You mean apart from you and the Pillar you’re running with you mean?” At their terrible poker faces, he knew he had them. He pulled the sword off the wall. “Yeah, I know all about Wrath’s little games, bombing the senate, getting cosy with the Amrays. Youse sure it’s not her that’s the one destabilising things?”
</p>
<p>
	Oryx shared another look with Hallgrim, his cybernetic friend’s face reflecting his own thoughts back at him. Was it possible; was Wrath using them to cause chaos? To sow discord and somehow take control? Oryx knew the Pillars were devious and cruel when they needed to be, but this? This was against everything they supposedly stood for, a democratic Ilima. “We’re not here for any trouble, Beppi.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oryx, I’ll tell you what’s really going to happen here. You’re going to tell me where your little Reap bitch friend, your Rift-walking kid, and your rogue Pillar are, and then I’m going to give them up to the highest bidder.” Beppi smiled. “Coming here with the ‘we come in peace’ bit is wasted on me. If you wanted to be friends, why bring a Roboticop?”
</p>
<p>
	Hum13 looked furious. “Are you telling me there is a filthy fascist robot here?” The mechnical man casually rotated his entire torso 180 degrees so the hands tied behind his back could be visible, then cupped them together to plead with the gangster. “Look, you have to trust us, Mr Di Beppi. As they say back in the old village where I was born, ‘011 0001 11010 1101010’ and I think we can all agree with that.”
</p>
<p>
	Boopi Di Beppi drew the sword from its scabbard and took Hum13’s head clean off in one swipe. It rolled across the floor to stop at Hallgrim’s knees, where his eyes went dark. “You killed him. He was telling the truth, you short-arsed, Napoleon-complex, flacid cannolied…”
</p>
<p>
	Louis’ fist struck Hallgrim across the mouth to shut him up. “You want me to do the Norn or the handbag in waiting next, boss?”
</p>
<p>
	“No…no.” Hallgrim muttered. “I’ll tell you everything, anything you want to know. Just don’t kill me.”
</p>
<p>
	“You filthy Norn traitor!” Oryx roared as he jumped to his feet and charged at Hallgrim. Dwayne pulled a cattle prod from behind his back and pressed it deep into Oryx’s torso until he collapsed. Through fading consciousness, Oryx listened as Di Beppi gave orders.
</p>
<p>
	“Put him in the ring, we can see what the serpent makes of him. Take fuckwit here to my office, and bring the robot’s head - it’ll make a great punchbowl. Put the body in the security office, we’ll smelt it over the next few weeks, don’t want the Roboticops to come asking questions.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Oryx woke to the sound of a crowd chanting, and blinked the severe lights away to find he was in a circular, deep pit walled by obsidian stone. Becoming suddenly aware of a weight around his neck, he reached up to find a control collar. As Oryx tried to pull at it, it zapped him with a static discharge and made his vision blur. He stood up, dazed from the attack and stared up at the ring of seats surrounding him, each one filled with a person shouting. They screamed: “Serpent! Serpent! Serpent!” at him, brandishing their fists.
</p>
<p>
	“Actually, my Splicer classification is Crocodylidae. It is a most common misconception especially as our particular clan of Splicers were the only reptilian colony before we were wiped out.” Oryx polished his glasses as he tried to educate the crowd. “You notice the conical teeth and thicker scales I was cursed with. Serpent Splicers tend to still have hands and feet, but thinner hides and fangs.”
</p>
<p>
	“Serpent! Serpent! Serpent!” The crowd brayed. One man had a sign that said ‘Serpent Cru!’, with the word Crew spelled ‘CRU’. Oryx was more horrified by the misspelling than the danger he suddenly realised he was in. He was a mutant crocodile, but he still had standards.
</p>
<p>
	“Serpent! Serpent! Serpent!” 
</p>
<p>
	A metallic creak sounded behind Oryx, and as he turned to locate the source of the noise, he found a large portcullis opening behind him. 
</p>
<p>
	“And now…” A voice came over the public address system. “For our main event of the evening, it’s scale versus scale here at the Snake Lounge. In our pit we have the Splicer Crocodile, Oryx, the thriller soon to be a manilla handbag, the croc who’ll soon have a cleaned clock, the mean, green, death rolling machine…against our champion contender, the venomous victor, the slippery scrapper, the python of pain, put your hands together Fang Gang, for the Velit Viper…Valis!”
</p>
<p>
	A splicer stepped out from behind the metal structure, a part woman, part snake with glazed, dead eyes that both looked at and past Oryx. The Snakewoman wore an electric control collar similar to the one Oryx wore, worn for so long the shredded flesh of her neck had grown around it. She also had a scar that ran from eye to mid neck, a scar that Oryx could never have forgotten.
</p>
<p>
	“Sister?” He whispered, hoping Valis could hear him.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	“I’m telling you, mate, you’ve gotta sweeten the deal a little for me. I don’t drop trousers on the first date.” Hallgrim said through a mouth of blood that drooled from his slackened jaw. 
</p>
<p>
	Louis punched him again. “Shut up, Hallgrim, I don’t want to have to tug your machine parts out and get the info that way.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim sat up and smiled. “I’ve got some choice parts you can tug on, you prat.” 
</p>
<p>
	Boopi Di Beppi stood on the far side of his office and watched the proceedings from afar. They hadn’t asked Hallgrim a single question yet, and he knew that this was Beppi’s way of interrogating his victims, it had worked throughout his career and he wasn’t changing his style for anyone. “Just download the info and shove him on the scrap pile. I haven’t got time for this. I’ll be in my hot tub, sweating all this gabagool outta my system. Who knew processed cured meats were bad for you?”
</p>
<p>
	He sauntered off out of his office, leaving Louis and Dwayne to argue over who was going to extract what parts of Hallgrim, before noticing that the cyborg was smiling.
</p>
<p>
	“What machineman grinning at?” Dwayne asked.
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim gestured over to Beppi’s desk, where Hum13’s head was upside down and full of nuts. “Because you fellas were stupid enough to think knocking my friend’s head off would kill him.”
</p>
<p>
	The windows startup noise sounded from Hum13’s head, which then sprouted large metal legs that turned him upside down and deposited pistachios all over the black tiled floor. “Did I do that?” He said. “I CONFIRM I DID AND ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY.”
</p>
<p>
	Dwayne charged at the decapitated Hum13, before slipping on a bunch of pistachios and fell forward, cracking his head open on Beppi’s desk, instantly dying. “*Humour Mode Activated.* That guy is a shell of his former self, huh?”
</p>
<p>
	Louis cried in fury and blinked his tears away. “Dwayne, my baby!” He charged at Hum13 who held his hands up. 
</p>
<p>
	“Wow, what a nuts-o reaction!” Hum13 said as he held his pointed, metal, telescopic arms up. Louis ran straight into the arms, impaling himself on the pointed ends and joining his love in an ignominious end. 
</p>
<p>
	“Wow that guy *HUMOUR MODE ERROR* was stuck with these titanium arms and had his organs pierced until he was dead. Funny, huh?” Hum13 said as Louis slowly slipped down the arms, leaving dark red blood dripping from the metal.
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim’s face was one of utter horror at the unrepentant barbarism. “Y..yeah mate, funny. Now please untie me so we can get out of here.”
</p>
<p>
	Hum13 propped his head up in front of Beppi’s computer and started tapping away with his robotic, blood soaked metal props. “One second, my friend, let me see if our gangster’s security is as loose as that terrible toupee he wears. Ha Ha Ha. Humanoid blood does glow in this light doesn’t it? INAPPROPRIATE URGE TO KILL FILED UNDER REPRESSION FILE.”
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	Oryx ducked as Valis lunged, fangs out in attack. The snakewoman smashed into the stone, taking chunks from the wall as she did. Oryx had barely turned before she was on him again, thin fingers wrapped around his neck. “Valis.” He gasped. “Sister, still your gaze on my face. I appreciate that we haven’t been in each other's company since the purge, but you must recognise your own kin?”
</p>
<p>
	His words dashed against the vague clouded eyes in his sister’s face, her expression one of nothing but blind fury. She buried her fangs into Oryx’s arm and he howled in pain, backhanding her across the stone floor.
</p>
<p>
	The crowd surrounding the pit bellowed in appreciation, the chants of serpent growing louder as the fight went on. Velis twisted on the spot and swung her tail at Oryx, who caught it and yanked her towards him. He held his arm aloft and clotheslined her so hard she bounced off the stone floor. 
</p>
<p>
	He had hoped a solid hit would rouse her, but she shook her head and reared as if she intended to run at him again. The last time Oryx had seen his other Splicers, his sister, his parents, was back on the colony before the bombs were dropped. Twenty years before, the Pillars had been sent to the rim after the Splicers refused to fight against the Reap. It was not their war, after the way the Veliteans had so cruelly treated them, had outlawed their very existence. When the Pillars arrived at the head of an invasion force, the Splicers intended to fight. But the Pillars did not so much as set boot to soil, and instead bombed from orbit, to destroy everything and everyone he had ever known and loved. 
</p>
<p>
	Looking at his sister, realising that she had been here all these years, fighting until she had been driven mad by this shock collar and trauma, Oryx felt empty. He should have tried to find her more diligently, searched every planet and moon, but he had assumed them all dead. Valis hacked and slashed at Oryx, bubbles forming in her mouth and those dead eyes staring at him in a vacant anger. Oryx took every hit and cut, every scratch and graze. And with it his ire raised at the predicament of his people, the injustice of it, the unfairness. He wanted to rip the world in two.
</p>
<p>
	Then the lights went out, and the crowd screamed.
</p>
<p>
	***
</p>
<p>
	“Will you either reattach your head, or get out of the way?” Hallgrim shouted, elbowing Hum13’s metallic body as he tried to tap into the Snake Lounge’s security systems. Hum13’s body responded by walking into a filing cabinet and tripping, sending him flying to the floor. 
</p>
<p>
	“Sorry friend Hallgrim, I am having that usual humanoid problem of missing head syndrome.” Hum13’s head next to Hallgrim looked from side to side, hoping that Hallgrim wouldn’t ask too many questions. “Have you ever experienced this issue?”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh yeah, my head used to go missing all the time. Used to find it down the track, having a flutter on the horses.” Hallgrim said, not wanting to confront Hallgrim in a confined space about his identity issues.
</p>
<p>
	“*ANXIETY MODE DISABLED* Phew.” Hum13 said as his head crawled over to his body and slipped back onto his shoulders. “Now I just need to hope I do not get a crick in my neck.”
</p>
<p>
	Hallgrim stared ahead. “Y…yeah, sure. On an entirely unrelated matter, I’m going to just turn off the entire electrical grid so we don’t have to be here anymore.” With a push of a button, the lights went out in the entire building, and Hallgrim grabbed at Hum13’s arm in the dark, before standing up. “ Would you mind guiding me back to Oryx, he’s in the main hall on the ground floor.”
</p>
<p>
	“A good idea, but is your completely normal humanoid night vision mode not functioning?” Hum13 enquired innocently.
</p>
<p>
	“It must be offline, along with my fear-repression and anti-dread over a fucked up killing machine software.” Hallgrim gritted his teeth as they walked out of the security office.
</p>
<p>
	“Wow, you got all the upgrades when you were born, huh?” Hum13 whistled. “Talk about programmed with a silver spoon.”
</p>
<p>
	They moved up to the ground floor and out into the main hall gingerly. The panicked screams of the crowd echoing in the hall. The sounds of muffled struggling could be heard on the otherside of the room, and Hum13 stopped unexpectedly. 
</p>
<p>
	“Oryx? Are you out there, mate? The plan worked, we’re good to go.” Hallgrim called into the dark.
</p>
<p>
	“Not…yet…we’re…rrrr…not.” Oryx growled before a large cracking could be heard.
</p>
<p>
	As the emergency lighting flickered on, a bloody Hallgrim sat on the floor, a dead snake splicer across his lap. He pushed the body off slowly and hung his head as Hallgrim and Hum13 approached. “You…you ok buddy?” Hallgrim asked.
</p>
<p>
	Oryx looked up, a glazed look on his face, whilst Hum13 removed the control collar from his friend. He let it clutter to the floor and then placed the body gently alongside it.
</p>
<p>
	“Who was she?” Hum13 asked, putting a hand to his friend’s shoulder.
</p>
<p>
	“A victim of Boopi Di Beppi.” Oryx growled.
</p>
<p>
	“Well, we’re going to have to wait to avenge her, the fucker bogged off the moment the lights went out.” Hallgrim sneered. “I can’t detect him anywhere in the vicinity.”
</p>
<p>
	“Regrettable, but karma will catch up with the Spaghetti Strangler soon enough.” 
</p>
<p>
	Hum13 extended his forearm and sent it up to the edge of the pit. Oryx grabbed it and started to climb up. 
</p>
<p>
	“And he still thinks he’s human?”
</p>
<p>
	“Don’t mate, I’m going to be in therapy for weeks.” Hallgrim muttered.
</p>
<p>
	The three of them climbed to the top of the walled pit. “So, are we any clearer regarding the would-be assassins of the Amrays?”
</p>
<p>
	Hum13 nodded. “All i’ll say is we need to get to Wrath, now.” he said as he walked away.
</p>
<p>
	“Erm , why? Can’t you tell us now?” Hallgrim muttered. “We exist in real time, it’s not like we have to end on a cliffhang…” 
</p>
<p>
	THE END 
</p>
