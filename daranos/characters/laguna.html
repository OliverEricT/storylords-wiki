<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  The biggest tittied mermaid you will ever meet in your life. She is also a part time lifguard.
</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>
  When <a href="/daranos/characters/billbertdinglesmith">Billbert</a> caught her in the lake, she offered Billbert a wish. Billbert asked for a plate of fish and chips. This being a particularly small wish, made it very difficult for Laguna to grant it properly. This led to many shenanigans for Billbert.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
  What they look like and shit
</p>

<h2>Powers</h2>

<p>
  She grants wishes to anyone who catches her. Due to the nature of wishes; the bigger they are the easier they are for Laguna to handle... Just like your momma last night.
