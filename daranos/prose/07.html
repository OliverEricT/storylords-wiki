The Prophecy (Not the Movie Starring Christopher Walken)
Prompts: Premonitions & Bards
by Josh Henderson

Daranos was no stranger to amazing artists. There was Winfield Crackers, Daranos's premiere squeezebox man. That man squeezed a good box. He also played a mean accordian (klaxons go off DAMN SON). Then there was Rusty Sharleen. She used the blood of her enemies to paint the most beautiful landscapes. All red. And I guess green because some weirdos have green blood in this whacky ass place. Green Bud green bud I always say. Her vistas were so realistic its said that the King of the Region of Dilb once walked into one looney tunes style and actually went through the painting. When his royal guards tried to follow they hit the wall behind the painting and then a harpsicord fell on their heads. That was a closed casket affair and the harpsicord was severly out of tune for weeks.

But of course not all artisans were, shall we say, talented. Or "good". Or "brushed their teeth". Or "knew what soap was". Or "didn't cause everyone to vomit in their mouths slightly at the sight, sound, smell and/or psycic whiff of their talentless hack ass no skill waste of time lives". But I'm paraphrasing of course.

Vlog Bogson was just that type of artisan. As a young Orc all he wanted to do was change his  mind about what he wanted to do. Constantly he would pick up a new trade, or skill, or have some whack ass plan to make an anus ton of gold only to have every single one of his ventures fail harder than that time you forgot to study for math and you just picked C for every question except it was a math test so it wasn't even multiple choice. I mean English you can bullshit your way to at least a D+. Math dont' give a fuck about your weekend plans though you will fail that shit and get grounded. Math is a narc.

Vlog now stood on stage at Daranos's toughest meanest pub. The Titty Twister. The Grall City Fathers outlawed the owners from reopening the establishment after it was found out that anyone who lost a barfight wound up in their pork bbq but that didn't stop people from just reopening it. Like literally. You can't stop people if they just do shit. Like just go out and do something nobody gonna fuckin stop you. Plus that pork BBQ was fucking amazing even though it was some Fried Green Tomatos-Ass canibalistic slop. I had some. Changed my whole life.

Vlog's newest foray into success and happiness was playing the lute. Did Vlog practice everyday for years? No...no he didn't practice anything especially oral hygene but we already went over that. Vlog saw a bard on the street one day who was playing for buttons or whatever and thought "I could do that and get rich" even though clearly the guy playing on the street was not in fact, rich.

"BOOOOOOO" a drunk ogre shouted from the back.


"But I haven't even played yet" Vlog said with an innocent smile. The kind that instantly made people want to punch his stupid idiot face hole.

"FUCK YOU DORK" Yelled a guy dressed as a pirate. He wasn't a pirate though he was just the mascot for the local Orcsketball team the Grall Gamblers. Pirates gamble look it up.

"Alright this is my first gig so lets kick it off with a hit" Vlog said ignoring the tough crowd. "This one is called 'I'm Just a Booty Boi (Shake Ya Booties Boys)"

Vlog began to strum the strings of the lute in the most god awful way. The lute was out of tune. The neck was warped and the strings sounded like they were made from the leftover sinkn pubes of a snow yeti who had just manscaped for the first time since the 1st age thinking he was going to  score on his date later. He did not. But that wasn'tn the worst of it. Vlog then begane to sing his 100% all original lyrics. 

"I'm just a booty boi...so shake ya booties boys

I'm a little stinker yall so shake ya whooties yall

*whooties in this instance doesn't mean what it does in our world in Daranos whootie denotes a fat butted witch. This shit is like the Silmarilion bitch we got fuckin footnotes up in here. Try to keep up baby baaaaby.

The song continued....

"Why don't u come over and show me how a freak

Cause I drink unclean water from a creek"

This went on for an agonizing 5 and a half minutes. Like this mother fucker thought he was Freddie Mercury writing a hit that could be over five minutes. And yes THAT Freddie Mercury. He exists in Daranos because that guy is a fucking legend and we were all lucky to have shared the same univrse with him. As Vlog strummed his last dissonant chord the crowd fell eerily silent.

"HOLY SHIT YOU FUCKING SUCK DORK" Yelled the pirate guy finally breaking the silence.

The entire pub started going insane with riot level rage. 

"UR DADDY SHOULDA PISSED IN YOUR MOTHERS BIRTH HOLE AND FAKED A JIZZ BC I'M SURE HE HATED EVERY SECOND OF BANGING HER HOW COULD HE NOT ONLY AN UNHOLY UNION OF LOVELESS MONSTERS COULD PRODUCE A FUCK TURD AS PATHETIC AS YOU YOU FUCKIN DOOOORK" yelled a really old orc.

"DAD?!" Vlog said surprised.

"NOT ANYMORE" Vlogs dad replied then left and never came back just like my dad did except I have social skills and people like me.

"Well I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet." Vlog said into the all talk ball. "But your kids are gonna love it"


"NO THEY WON'T YOU PIECE OF TALENTLESS SHIT" 

"MY KIDS DIED FROM SECOND HAND EMBARASSSMENT JUST NOW BI PROXY. THEY'RE LITERALLY ACROSS TOWN AND ARE LITERALLY DEAD. MY LINE IS BROKEN THANKS TO YOU" Yelled a nobleman.

"LETS THROW HIM INTO THE PORK BBQ" yelled a Hag who had a whooty. 

"YEAH" The horde yelled practicallyl salivating

"LETS USE HIS FINGER BONES AS TOOTHPICKS YOU USE TO PICK UP THOSE LITTLE WEENER DOGS AT CHRISTMAS TIME" yelled a druid.

"Y....YEAH" The crowd said again this time some of htem not know what he was talking about.

As the crowd approached the stage a Blobbits voice cut through the crowd

"I kinda liked it" the Blobbit admitted stupidly.

The roaring crowd fell instantly silent again. All of them slowly turned to see the Blobbit tapping his foot singing the awful tune everone had just auraly endured.

"GET  HIM" Yelled the pirate as the crowd converged.

"LOOKS LIKE PORK BBQ IS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS" 

Vlog took this chance to curtsy for the crowd even though nobody was looking or cared and made his way out of the pub. As he turned down an allyway he could see a gruff looking human man leaning against a wall smoking a pipe and wearing a flat brimmed hat. His face covered in the dark shadows of Grall. So dark they looked wet. I know I certainly am.

"You the lad who just played the Tiddy Twister" said the man with his head still tilted down.

"Oh yes that was me." Vlog said. "You wish for an autograph. Oh boy my first fan. You want an all see photo too?" Vlog struggled to get his iBall out of his pantaloons.

"Shit son hell no" Said the stranger. "You were truly terrible in there tonight. Sounded like a dog in heat locked in a room with nothing but cats"

"Thanks!" Vlog said stupidly. "Oh wait...thats bad isn't it?"

"Yes son it really is." The stranger said taking a long puff from his pipe and blowing out a smoke puff of a dude wailing on an electric lute and it even made the sound of a guitar solo somehow.

"Whoa" Vlog said amazed. 

"The names Capo Steelplucker. Whats your name kid?" The Capo asked.

"Vlog Bogson"

"Well Vlog you are the worst lute player I've ever heard and I've heard Boko Bono play Mastadon Square Garden. Not to mention your performance needs work to say the very least. I should know I was at Woodstock 99 so I've seen some awful life changing tragic and even criminal performanced in my time."

"Can...can you help me?" Vlog pleaded.

"Shit no son you're a lost cause. I do believe your mother should have placed you up for adoption and begged the fates that DNA would never be rediscovered so that you could find her later in life so's that she'd have to pretend like giving you up was the worst mistake of her life even though her life was not only better without you she actually had a pretty good life. I'm pretty sure in every instance in the multiverse she kept you she wishes for the sweet release of death. For you not her. You suck kid."

"Simple no would have done fine but oh well." Vlog said cheerily. "On to my next thing I guess. Maybe I'll be a professional Boner Cycle stunt man like Evil Khan the Evil."

"Now ya see there's your problem kid" Capo said looking up. "Always on to the next thing and never putting in the work do be truly good at something. You gotta give it some time" Capo said disappointedly.

"But...there is onen way" Capo interupted himself. "Nah you'd never be into that plus you probably don't want to be THAT successful." Capo said puffing on his pipe.

"What!?" Vlog said alert now. "I'll do it. I'll do anything to be famous and rich and covered in the reproductive secretions of my fans"

"Well that is the goal of everyone after all" Capo said laughing and putting a hand on Vlogs shoulder. "Tell you what you meet me at the crossroad bridge, the one near the road to the Hollow Forest. You know the one right?"


"No clue" Vlog said stupidly looking at aps on his iBall.

"I'll scroll you the location. The important thing is you meet me there one month from now during the eclipse of the two moons." Capo said. "One month remember"


"uh huh one week got it." Vlog said paying no attention whatsoever

'KId...ONE MONTH" 

"Yup got it a gallon of milk"

"WH...kid...you are fucking pissing me the fuck off" Capo said clenching his fists

"You got it piss in the duck loft got it"

ONE MONTH LATER

Capo stood alone on the crossroad bridge. The night was brighter than usual due in part to the double elcipse of the moons. It looked like the one moon was doggy styling the front moon. It truly was a blue cornhole moon alright.

Suddenly Capo heard the plucking of lute strings and a faint voice singinging off in the distance. Singing being the only word really I can use to describe the combination honking and spit noises Vlog called singing.

"CAPO" Vlog yelled as he approached.

"Kid...you made it" 

"I've been practicing" Vlog said proudly.

"Kid you sound worse than you did a month ago. Somehow you actually got worse. And I dont mean like 'you didn't improve much' I mean you are considerably tangibly objectivly worse at the lute. And your singing sounds like you were in a coma for a month and forgot how to use your tongue and had to relearn how to speak because you woke up speaking Froggish or something. You sound like you have aphasia but not just with words but with social interactions and body movements and all around just your brain is bad. You got a bad brain kid."

"Capo I missed you too" Vlog said cheerily. "So when we do we start to practice"

"We don't" Capo said unsheathing a silver dagger from up his leathery sleeve. "Give me your hand kid"

"OKAY" Vlog said without an ounce of fight in him. Kid was a fucking grade A pusswagon.

Capo took the knife and slit Vlogs hand. It took a good 15 seconds for Vlogs nervous system to calculate the information his pain receptors were slowly sending to his brain but by that time he had forgotten he had even been cut. This dude was a goldfish boy.

Capo then began to chant in a demonic tongue 

(chanting demon language)

As he did the light of the moons shifted and became as red as the blood from Vlogs hand. Redder than my fiery crotch in winter after I give up hope of any manscaping.

Capo continue to chant the words. Evil words. Words so heavy that they seemed to be actually physical matter and not just the result of vibrating air molecules. Soon a black horned ancient evil began to laugh. Vlog could only think "Did I leave the microwave on...what am I talking about I dknot even know what that is"

The demon manifested as solid black hate. Just standing around this thing seemed to decrease Vlog and Capos lifespan by years kind of like those dudes who went into Chernobil wearing like fishing golashes.

"YOU HAVE ANOTHER FOR ME" Said the lord of the dark.

"Yes my master I do. This one is special...he....uh....he is pretty dumb and I actually hate him so when you finally take his soul he's going to make hell like A MILLION times worse to be in just because he is there so we got a good one"

"EXCELLENT" The darkness said. "What is your wish BOY?"

"100 CHRISTMAS WEENIES PLEASE" Vlog shouted without a thought.

"No...sire he wants to be a famous bard" Capo said rubbing the bridge of his nose.

"AH A CLASSIC" the dark lord said laughing. "THEN IT SHALL BE DONE" Suddenly thunder and lightning and red streaks of powerful magic filled the air. Demons from the underworld sprouted up from the glade like zombified husks. Skeletons arouse from teh ground and did that dance from that old cartoon. The Lord of Darkness laughed and laughed. A silver lute appeared in Capos hand and he began to play Tush from ZZtop and like nobody ever listened to ZZ TOP in Daranos. I mean nobody.

"PLAY WITH YOUR NEW MASTER" the Dark Lord commanded to both Capo and Vlog.  Vlog picked up his lute and any imperfection in the lutes construction or design soon became part of the lutes magical charm. A well worn instrument that all great musicans play for a lifetime. The scuffs made the sound fuller. The strings were perfectly old enough...not too knew and not too old and rusty. The machine heads held tight and were cast in gold. 

The three played all night. The skill all 3 had was said to be the 69th wonder of the world. Lost to time when the dawn struck. If you had been there to witness it you'd not have survived. It was said to have been like hearing your favorite song for the first time combined with feeling a titty for the first combined with the first time I raided your sweet mama's crotch cave. Every note was like experiencing those highs for the first time but magnified by a thousand...no A MILLION. Indescribable exctasy. Like taking Molly on the best day of your life then getting into a time machine and doing it again and again and again. Your peener would have exploded. Your vageener would have collapse under the ever present orgasmic elation of the musics penetrating bliss.

"YOU KNOKW WHAT MUST BE DONE" The dark lord said as he sank back into the ground. "SEE YOU SOON" He laughed and smiled darkly as he vanished.

A few nights later Vlog again stood in front of a packed house at the Tiddy Twister. It was Pork BBQ night and all in attendance were HUNGRY.

"YOU STILL SUCK DORK" Yelled the pirate guy.

"EAT MY DIRTY ASS BALLS AND SUCK MY 3RD LEFT NUT YOU FUCKIN BABY BACK BITCH" yelled a new guy who was so mad he didn't get to raz Vlog the first time he spent an entire month writing down his jabs in his diary. 

Vlog stood tall however. He picked up his lute and strummed a chord so clean and so crips it was as if his fingers were in the exact right spot between the frets on a molecular level. Like his fingers were there but they weren't. It was quantum as fuck.

The entire crowd crew silent. The razzing had stopped.

Vlog began to play an epic. An epic he and Capo had written called "The Prophecy". Vlog's lute someone begant to sound like 2 lutes. As if he had 3 hands. It also became electrified. As if  some wizard had a cast a spell on it to make it sound like the hardest fucking rock n roll distortion pedal ever made. The song was a 20 minute long Ina Gada Devida-esque torrent of brilliance. You could  live a thousand lifetimes and never hear anything as hard and yet as soft as this epic. The song was alive. It moved. It cried. It howled in pain and screamed in pleasure all while taking everyone in that pub with it.  It told of a coming war. A coming hero. And a coming change. A young one would emerge. Love and hate and loss and new friends and fellowship. It told of corruption and danger and villainy that would try to cover the land. It told of a power too immense to control and fools and  heroes who would try to stop it. It told of the experience of all living beings. The notes were as if you saw the love of your life from across the room for the first time and knew you'd get to smash. It told of the fear in the darkest parts of our minds and the sounds that keep us up at night. The fear you feel when you know you're seeing something terrible and the excitement you feel when you see something miraculous. Sometimes without even saying a word the music told all this clear as a bell. Clear as a summer day. It told of all this and more. 

I'd try to relay to you the words but the beauty  of it would only cause Jeff and Rich and all of you dear listeners to cum pants so fast you'd think you were in prison for a decade. Then I'd probably be fired.

After the song was done the pub wept. The entire audience wept. Some all see balled their loved ones thinking that somehow they must have died and they were now in heaven or whatever passes for heaven for these beings. A goblin took out a dagger and slit his own throat knowing full well this was it. It wasn't gonna get better than this. The rest of his life would be chasing this high and no amount of Longbottom Leaf or Giggle Dirt or Jingle Jangle or Wolf Heroin was ever going to be good enough. And Wolf Heroin turns your ass into a fuckin WOLF DAWG.

Capo sat in the back and tipped his hat to Vlog. He then stepped out into the ally. Vlog rushed after him.

"CAPO WAIT" he yelled. 

"Ya did good kid but I have to be mosyin on now"

"But what about the band...you me and that big black dude" Vlog whined

"Ok first of all dont' call him 'That Big Black Dude' it makes me kind of uncomfortable. Secondly you did it kid. You wrote the greatest tale ever told. Go be yourself and fuck anyone you want and do giggle dirt until your nose rots off. This is what you wanted."


"Yeah ....I guess" Vlog said. "OK.....bye bye" and then went home to record his album.

Capo just laughed. As he turned around a black shroud surrounded him. His face began to contort and change. His clothing changed to a long robe. A staff grew from his lute case he was carring. As the black smoke disipated there stood a wizard.

"Hello there" Reeses the Wize said to apparently no one looking at the camera.

Reeses the WIze will return in Daranos the Next Generation.
