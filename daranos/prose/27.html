<p>
	"Quickly" Ugla said as she held up the Spear of Vaginas. "We're only gonna get one shot at this!" She screamed raising the spear at the gaping maw of Mantalor the Maw Eater.
</p>
<p>
	"I have a bad feeling about this...." Squib said as Ugla grabbed hold of him.
</p>
<p>
	"AHHHHHHHH" they both screamed as they surfed down Maw Eater's tentaccular arm as Ugla thew the spear into his gaping suck hole
</p>
<p>
	EXPLOSION
</p>
<p>
	"There's something....I have to tell you" Duchess Diamond Mercedes said as she sobbed into the Wonky Talky or whatever I called them last season.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" Buffcat said with an overwhelming sense of anticipation and anxiety.
</p>
<p>
	"You're.....snifff....you're gonna be a father." She cried. "I have your kittens in me"
</p>
<p>
	"Mew mewMEEEEWWWE?!?!?!" 
</p>
<p>
	EXPLOSION
</p>
<p>
	As the flames rose all around the Magical Justice Assembly of Avenging Heroes, Reeses, their fearless leader, turned the sacred Serentiy Skull over in his hands chanting a magical incantation.
</p>
<p>
	"Reeses....any day now" Sid said as he dual weilded crossbows landing 2 perfect bolts inbetween the eyes of 2 Children of Bloraxius.
</p>
<p>
	"If I dont get this right...." Reeses yelled. "The arcanum crystals will fuel the Desolation Matrix to the point of overload. And I think we all know what happens then...." 
</p>
<p>
	"I dont knowk what happens then" Flyman said sulking.
</p>
<p>
	"We all die in the fires of Bloraxius's eternal mind omnitrix and the arcanum itself will destabilize all of the mana in Daranos down to the quantum level" Fred said as he squeezed the neck of another Child of Bloraxiuis until he suffocated and 3'd.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh well lets do that then" Flyman said ready to die.
</p>
<p>
	"NOT TODAY" Ugla yelled as she shot ice bolts forward toward a hoard of incoming Flesh Puppies.
</p>
<p>
	*Self Destruct in 3.....2........1....." the skull began to count down.
</p>
<p>
	"I have a bad feeling about this" Reeses said closing his eyes and turning the runes over one last time.
</p>
<p>
	"MEW MEW MEWWWWWW" BUffcat yelled
</p>
<p>
	EXPLOSION
</p>
<p>
	And now. Season 2 of Daranos The Next Generation continues....
</p>
<p>
	"My dearest Gunk," Chic Pea started to dictate to a magical quill that was writing on an old and yellowed piece of parchment. It was probably magical too like if you were to use the wrong form of "there" or "their'' it would like automatically fix that shit for you probably.
</p>
<p>
	"We all miss you very much and like junk. Peppercorn even misses clearing out the all see-puters search history. You really opened him up to something new with such scrolls as 'Bearded Dwarven Milf Muffs' and 'Dwarvem Mommy Milkers' or is as commonly abbreviated and reffered to as 'Dommy Dilkers'?"
</p>
<p>
	The quill stopped writing and slowly turned to look at Chic Pea who was doing her nails on her tiny kitty cat sized bed.
</p>
<p>
	"What? Thats what they call it" She said rolling her eyes. "Prude ass quill"
</p>
<p>
	"ANYWAY" she cointinued and stared ad the prudish writing utensil. "Sid has been keeping us busy, what with the Paladins in Graal being disbanded. Because of this we've taken the roll of Sheriffs of this here town" She said doing finger guns with her tiny cute fingers.
</p>
<p>
	"I know what happened has like...totally shattered your reality and stuff but we still miss you and love you or whatever lame hippie bullshit. We hope you come back and I hope to see you soon for T" She finished except it was just T like the letter and then in parenthesis (Tons of Glitter Dust Pussy).
</p>
<p>
	"Ok" she said. "Now sign it with a capital P and make it have little chicken legs and a beak. Thats my signature. Oh! And 8 = = = D and then 2 Cool S's like the Eight Equals D is penetrating them."
</p>
<p>
	The quill slowly turned again.
</p>
<p>
	"JUST DO IT!" 
</p>
<p>
	Chic Pea grabbed the letter and held it aloft as a Mail Mallard flew by and snapped it up in its claws? Do mallards have claws? Webbing? Their ducks right?
</p>
<p>
	"Quak quak" he said as he flew away tipping his mail mallard cap.
</p>
<p>
	Chic Pea walked out of her room to find the usual Weensday crowd of people gathered around the Flamingos "hide out" which wasn't so much a hide out anymore since everyone and their orc fucking mother knew where to find them. Especially now that the PODs were gone everyone was coming to the Flamingos with their problems. 
</p>
<p>
	Chic Pea rolled her eyes as she walked past a couple who got their peeners stuck in a cursed double sided sex torch. She waved her hand and the curse was lifted freeing their dongs like all dongs should be. Just free to feel the dang breeze boys.
</p>
<p>
	Fred had turned part of the hide out into a bar since SOMEONE burned down the Flamingos usual tavern during a freak staffling gun incident allegedly during the freeing of Graal.
</p>
<p>
	"One Meade Me at the Sacrificial Alter" Chic said snapping at Fred.
</p>
<p>
	"Comin right up, Princess" he said mixing a drink as Chic Pea sat at one of the only empty stools. On the other side of the bar Sid was frantically trying to hear everyone as they each shouted their problems in unicen. Peppercorn was furiously writing as many down as he could on a scroll like that one dude in Trading Places at the end when the Duke Boys get fucked up their white honky asses.
</p>
<p>
	"ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ONE AT A TIME" Sid yelled as the crowd just went on being loud and obnoxious like is want to happen when more than 3 people get together. I hate fuckin people man.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly, from outside, trumpets blared and a booming voice of the mayors cryer sounded except the mayor, Joey Pizza, hired a goblin Dank Stiennatra impersonator.
</p>
<p>
	"OH hear yee hear yee. Here comes DA MAYOR. He's got TINGS TO SAAAY and DOOOOO. O BOOP BOOP DABOOOO GOILY"
</p>
<p>
	The crowd fell silent as Mayor Joey Pizza entered the building wearing his mayor sash and overtop of a chef's apron that said "Kiss the Mayor" but someone had crossed out the ss in kiss and replaced it with a ck so it said "KICK the mayor".
</p>
<p>
	"FLAMINGOOOOOOOOS" he yelled over the now super silent crowd. "IN MY OFFFICE. NOW!"
</p>
<p>
	"Uh....you like....came to our office" Chic Pea said slamming a drink.
</p>
<p>
	"You're on THIN ICE DETECTIVE MISSY" he said pointing at her
</p>
<p>
	"hahah what?" She said looking around.
</p>
<p>
	"Mayor...." sighed Sid. "What brings you down to our bar/hide out/detective agency?/I dont even know anymore what it is we do?"
</p>
<p>
	"SID" Joey said rubbing his bloodshot eyes. "I'm having a noivous breakdown dere. I ain't know nothing about runnin no CITY!?!? I thought they just ran themselves like the Rethuglicans always are saying. Toins out you gotta like be organized and like...do stuff? MAMA MIA" Mayor Pizza slouched down on a nearby chairi as the crowd of people made their way out of the bar/hide out/detective agency?
</p>
<p>
	"But on top of all da other problems we got another cherry on top of the problem sundae" He went on almost crying. Like a broken man who hasn't slept and hasn't written his story for the show tomorrow and now its like really late and TIMES UP. Cherry on top of hte problem Sundae.
</p>
<p>
	"Before the POD's all were murdered by the avenging fire of the civilians they terrorized, they was woikin on something big. My capos...I MEAN...interens....yeah intnoins found a secret passage in POD headquarters"
</p>
<p>
	"Alright" Sid said now rubbing his bloodshot eyes.
</p>
<p>
	"TOINS OUT this place is booby trapped up tight like yo mama's recipe for Wet Red Noodles. I kept sending in intoins but they kept getting moidalized by the booby traps like those poor ARAB felllas in Last Crusade. They didn't know WHAT THE FUCK wass going on they don't even pray to that god! Poor mooks."
</p>
<p>
	"Alright I'll look into it" Sid said standing up. "If only to get me out of this place for a few hours at least" Sid snapped and Socks quickly ran onto his back and sheathed himself in sword form in the back scabbard.
</p>
<p>
	"I'll go with" Peppercorn said. "I have a bit of a fetish for booby (he giggles) traps."
</p>
<p>
	"No" Sid said firmly. "I mean any other time I'd love to have you with but I can't have you literally with your dick in your hand while I make sure you don't die from like a bowling ball fallling down the steps or like you sliding on a bunch of micro machines and then a flame throwing like melting your hat...."
</p>
<p>
	"Ouhhhhhh yeah keep going daddy" Pep said as he probably 3'd.
</p>
<p>
	CUT TO: POD HEADQUARTERS
</p>
<p>
	Sid walked slowly and deliberately through the abandoned Paladin barracks. Only the crunch of loose broken viles and the creak of the old wood floors occassionally made a sound. Sid was pretty confident he was alone so he didn't really stealth it up as they say. Who says that you ask? Well lots of people  you smart ass dick. Maybe if you actually listened to people instead of trying to interject your pointless not at all interesting stories into the conversation you'd actually make some fuckin friends ya annoying pathological bastard. Fuck.
</p>
<p>
	Sid reached the locker room where Mayor Pizza had said they found the secret door. 
</p>
<p>
	"Locker 69" he said. "Nice"
</p>
<p>
	As he reached for the handle of locker #69 he pulled. 
</p>
<p>
	"BLAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH" a skelemaan popped out shouting.
</p>
<p>
	Sid, having himself been on edge jumped only the slightest.
</p>
<p>
	"Ahhhh I'm just fuckin with you bro" the skeleman said. "C'mon bro relax have a good time I'm just messing with you. Oh c'mon don't be like that wanna Meade Lite?"
</p>
<p>
	The skelemans voice muffled as Sid shut the locker. He was still in there talking. Sid looked at the number and saw the 9 was loose. He turned it down. Locker 66.
</p>
<p>
	"Stupid rama fama jump scare son of a cliche ass movie trope" he said cursing away as the Bro Skeleman kept saying "BRO BRO BRO" or whatever.
</p>
<p>
	Sid sidestepped over a few lockers and opened the acctual locker 69. Against the well in the back he knocked. It sound firm in some spots and hallow and wet ready to gaped open in other spots.
</p>
<p>
	As he knocked he heard a  CLICK. Using his rogue reflexes he did a Katherine Zeta Jones in that movie with Sean Connery and artfully dodged as a smattering of poison darts shot out from the locker. As he did a back flip he saw the glint of a release button inside the locker. As he twisted to land he threw a single kunai Ninja Guiden style and hit the switch dead on.
</p>
<p>
	CLICK CLACK the wall behind the locker gave way to a long dark staircase.
</p>
<p>
	"BRO BRO BRO THAT WAS SICK BRO YOU SHOULD GO TO MY GYM BRO WE HAVE A PARKOUR COURSE AND THEY SERVE GREEN SMOOTHIES BRO" the skeleman said from within the other locker.
</p>
<p>
	Sid looked over at locker 66. Walked over to it. Opened it up and took out the Bro Skeleton.
</p>
<p>
	"BRO YEAH LETS GO LETS FUCKIN GO BRO PARKOUR TIL OUR ARMS ARE SORE BOI"
</p>
<p>
	Then with a single toss down the stair case Sid threw the skeleman.
</p>
<p>
	"BRO WHAT THE FUCK BRO OUCH OH FUCK BRO OH MAN BRO NOT COOL MAN RELAX BRO IT WAS A JOKE BRO" The skeleman screamed as he hit every flame, dart, acid, and jizz trap all the way down the stairs.
</p>
<p>
	"More than one way to skin a cat" Sid said smiling
</p>
<p>
	"MEOW" Socks cried from his back.
</p>
<p>
	"Sorry buddy....More than one way to reskin ...uh....a skeleton? Is that better?"
</p>
<p>
	"MEW" Socks agreed.
</p>
<p>
	Sid walked down the long stairwell to find himself in a room that was as stupid as it was big. In every direction he could see doors. A big circular room with just liike 20 god damn doors.
</p>
<p>
	"Fuck this" Sid said. He reached into his sack of tricks and pulled out a green glowing dusts. Later alchemists would come to find out that this stuff was in fact powdered radium and anyone who used it was being dosed with HUGE amounts of radiation but like Sid was a Troll and they have like immunity saving throws against that shit or something. Sid blew the dust and as it hit the ground he could see the marks of footprints. He slowly followed the prints withi his keen eyes careful not to move and trigger more traps.
</p>
<p>
	"Socks" he said turning around. "CAT-A-SCOPE"
</p>
<p>
	MEW" Socks agreed turning himself into a telescope and landing in Sids hand. Sid held up socks and then asked "Do I even want to know what end I'm looking through?"
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" Socks replied....from the front of the telescop.
</p>
<p>
	Sid looked through anyway and saw at the end of the trail of dust was a door that had a hidden lock pad.
</p>
<p>
	"Jackpot" he said. Moving slowly he and Socks, who was back in sword form, walked over to thee door with the pad. Sid reached into his pack again and pulled out a moon crystal and held it up against the numbers. "9....4...0...2....6" he said quietly.
</p>
<p>
	"Heh" he laughed. "Classic" He then typed in the correct code 69420. CLICK CLANK CLONK. The door didn't open but instead a small hand sized hold sprung open from the center of the door.
</p>
<p>
	"Glory Hole?" he said. Slowly Sid reached his hand into the hole. He gritted his teeth waiting for the sting of a bite or the burn of flame or the flesh to be melted off his hand by acid or for the sticky warmth of jizz.
</p>
<p>
	CLICK
</p>
<p>
	"Oh shit" he said trying to pull his hand out.
</p>
<p>
	"OH SHIT" a voice from the other side of the door said as Sids hand tuggged toward the new voice.
</p>
<p>
	"Gunk?!?!" Sid said surprisesd.
</p>
<p>
	"Who the....oh for the love of FUCK" Gunk replied obviously not happy to hear Sid. Just then the door CLICKED again and began to lower itself into the stone floor below.
</p>
<p>
	"Uhhhhh" Gunk said as he looked through the now sinking hole in the door. On the other side he saw Sid lower hisemf down with the speed of the sinking hole. "What do we do?" Gunk asked in a panic.
</p>
<p>
	"There's gotta be a release or something. Can you see any candle sticks or like weird rocks or like a painting?"
</p>
<p>
	"There's a candle stick up on the wall...." Gunk said.
</p>
<p>
	"Ok....try to turn it"
</p>
<p>
	"Very funny tall man" Gunk said looking up at the out of reach lever.
</p>
<p>
	"Well I guess we'll just have to lose our hands. I'll miss you lefty..." Sid said blowing a kiss to his hand with his other hand. Both men lowered and lowerd until the door sank so that the chain between them was just about to be clipped by the end of the hole. They winced and braced for flesh to tear from their hands and for their arms to ripped from their sockets. And then....nothing. The door passed right over the chain.
</p>
<p>
	"A fucking illlusion" Sid said shaking his head. "Fucking hells bells"
</p>
<p>
	"Great" Gunk said as the door disappeared. He could see Sid. It was the first time they had seen each other since the Battle of Graal. The first time since Duncan...well...you know.
</p>
<p>
	"YOu mean to tell me that we didn't even need to stick our hands in this fuckin glory hole!??" Gunk yelled. 
</p>
<p>
	"Guess not" Sid said as he examined the chain that linked the two adventures.
</p>
<p>
	"Well rogue...can you get us out of this" Gunk shook the chain and it rattled.
</p>
<p>
	"I dont think so. This is Paladanian Steel. It's protected by holy magic so we'd need a Paladin or a cleric or maybe someone with metal claws to get us out of this. Oh and WHAT THE FUCK are you doing down here anyway?" Sid demanded to know.
</p>
<p>
	"I AM DOING MY JOB" Gunk yelled back. "As leader of Gunk's Crunks I heard there was crazy good treas down here."
</p>
<p>
	"Gunks Crunks?" Sid said raising an eyebrow. "Thats a terrible name Gunk''
</p>
<p>
	"I KNOW IT IS!" Gunk yelled " But Duncan was the names guy I...."he stopped. "Fuck you Sid"
</p>
<p>
	"Who the HELL told you there was treasure down here?" Sid asked.
</p>
<p>
	"WHO THE HELL TOLD YOU THERE WAS TREASURE DOWN HERE MR INTEROGATION!?" Gunk yelled getting more pissed.
</p>
<p>
	"Nobody...The Mayor...there's NO treasure down here. I came down here because the Paladins were up to something down here. I came to investigate."
</p>
<p>
	"By yourself?" Gunk laughed. "Fuckin moron"
</p>
<p>
	"You're by yourself" Sid pointed out.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah but I'm not a pussy ass babies foreskin" Gunk said laughing.
</p>
<p>
	Sid squinted. "Who told you about this place....?"
</p>
<p>
	Back at the Flamingos headquarters Chic Pea was sitting at the bar drinking a giant tropical drink as she turned and winked at the camera.
</p>
<p>
	"NONe YA" Gunk said.
</p>
<p>
	"yeah yeah Non Ya business. Good one old man."
</p>
<p>
	Sid looked into the room that Gunk had been in. Inside he saw a room much like the one he was standing in. So much so that it was exactly like the one he was standing in.
</p>
<p>
	"What is this place?" He said out loud.
</p>
<p>
	Gunk looked around Sid and saw that Sid was also in a room that looked like Gunk's side of the room.
</p>
<p>
	"I dont know but I want out of this Twin Peaks ass infinite loop metaphor for hell before a gnome starts singing backwards or some dumb shit"
</p>
<p>
	Both men both took a step forward from their respective perspectives. The chain CLANGED as it reached it taught point stopping both men from moving.
</p>
<p>
	"Where are you going this is the way out" Sid said.
</p>
<p>
	"I wass JUST in there and its the way I came from so this is the way out" Gunk said.
</p>
<p>
	Sid laughed. "I assure you I jusst came from there. Is this your first puzzle room? You can't go back you can only go forward."
</p>
<p>
	"THATS WHAT I"M DOING BITCH" GUnk yelled spitting on the ground.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly just as it seemed teh two adventurers were going to come to blows all the lights in the rooms turned themselves out as if a great gust of wind had blown through. Except gusts of wind down't usually relight candles with red flames. Usually.
</p>
<p>
	"What the fuck is this place?" Gunk asked out loud.
</p>
<p>
	Then the laughing began. Ear piercing laughter. It sped up to a high pitch. Then it sped up more to a frequency only dogs and your ugly unfuckable ass mama could hear. Sid grabbed at his ears as Gunk strained to pull his arm back from Sid pulling at it.
</p>
<p>
	In agony Sid looked up to see a single candle was still lit with regular boring yellow light. He winced as he streeeetched to grab it. Finally with one thrust he reached the candle and pulled it.
</p>
<p>
	CLICK CLICK
</p>
<p>
	The screaming stopped. It was silent.
</p>
<p>
	"That was weird" Gunk said with a chuckle.
</p>
<p>
	And then they fell. The ground didn't give out but instead the 2 phased through it like the floor was too an illusion. They yelled and screamed. Sid tried to acrobatically adjust himself in mid air. Had he not been chained to a bowling ball with lips he could probably survive this fall.....then after like 20 seconds he thought "ehhh maybe not". And then SLAM. The two stopped inches from the ground. Gunk was upside down and spittle and drool rolled from his beard as he cursed and said things that your uncle probably said last Thanksgiving. Not racist but like....not NOT racist ya know?
</p>
<p>
	Sid floated down on his feet gently landing.
</p>
<p>
	"That was fun. Kind of like that tower ride at Pizzney Land"
</p>
<p>
	"WELCOME TO MY LAIR" a voice interupted as an organ discordantly blared a chord that was simultaneously in a minor key and a major key.
</p>
<p>
	Up on a thrown sat....a vampire.
</p>
<p>
	"Hello my friends" he said playing another awful chord.
</p>
<p>
	"Bro you suck" Said a skeleman in the corner of the room. "Bro like for real you are bad at this"
</p>
<p>
	The Vampire lord held out a hand and shot lightning out of his fingers like Palps himself dusting the skele-bro.
</p>
<p>
	"HEY BRO IT WAS A JOKE BRO JUST RELAX BRO  HAVE A GOOD TIME BROOOO AAAAAHHHH"
</p>
<p>
	"THANK YOU" SId shouted. "FUCK THAT GUY"
</p>
<p>
	"I know right like...don't tell me to just 'relax bro' I'm a vampire we invented relaxing"
</p>
<p>
	"So uh....." Gunk interupted. "What uh...what are we uh...doing here and do you have any treasure you want to get rid of?"
</p>
<p>
	"BOY DO I HAVE AN OFFER FOR YOU" The Vampire flourished his hands as an all see ball projected a power point presentation onto the wall above him.
</p>
<p>
	"Have you boys ever thought about the lucritive and exciting world of Thralling?" As he said this a royalty free midi version of Enter Sandman began to play. The Vampmre then whipped out a queue card and began to read awkwardly clearly not having practiced much must like the narator fo this show.
</p>
<p>
	"The world of Unpaid Thralling is a great way to gain experience in the blood arts as well as make life long connections to those whom you feast on their very life essences....in short IT WWILL SUCK. YOu. IN!" He finished with a sad flourish of his hands.
</p>
<p>
	"Pass" Sid said.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah pass" Gunk said. "So how do you wanna do this" He turned to Sid. "I take the bottom of the hammer and you take the top and we crush his skull or...?"
</p>
<p>
	"Nah that won't work" Sid said shaking his head. "I'm pretty sure Vampires can like blow on their thumbs and reinflate their bodies if they've been crushed"
</p>
<p>
	"WHAT?" Gunk said "Thats not true. Where did you hear that?"
</p>
<p>
	"Its like...classic Vampire lore man"
</p>
<p>
	"TIS true" The Vampire interupted. "We can also paint tunnels on walls and go through them and then like when a regular person tries to go through them they hit the wall and sometimes they hit it like pretty hard and get hurt a lot. Its pretty funny."
</p>
<p>
	Sid made the "see?" gesture at the Vampire.
</p>
<p>
	"Look guys....I'm going to level with you. Ever since the Paladins dissapeared they haven't been sending down anyone to feed me. And all of my brothers and sisters ran off when the food supply dwindled."
</p>
<p>
	"Wait...."Sid stopped him. "Who was getting sent down here?"
</p>
<p>
	"Oh you know like bums and homeless people. Some city's like build spikes on top of benches and do all kinds of fucked up shit so bums don'lt sleep on stuff. But the PODs just sent them down here and we ate them or turned them Thrall."
</p>
<p>
	"Dude" Gunk said "That is fucked up."
</p>
<p>
	"hahah yeah" The vampire said just smiling. "So that's a no on the Thralling then? Is that a hard no or...."
</p>
<p>
	"Hard no" both Sid and Gunk said simultlaneously.
</p>
<p>
	"Well fiddle sticks" the vampire lord said. "Who am I gonna talk to now?"
</p>
<p>
	"Well" Sid said. "If you want you can come up to Flamingos Headquarters whenever you want....both of you can" Sid said turning toward Gunk.
</p>
<p>
	Gunk looked up thinking for a moment. Sid then used his rogue tricks and unlocked the chain that was binding them. Gunk simply looked down and then up at Sid.
</p>
<p>
	"You son of a bitchless whore" Gunk said. "You could unlock it this whole time!? I'll fuckin KILL YOU" He said as he spit on the ground.
</p>
<p>
	"AWWWKWARD" The Vampire lord said sipping out of a juice box that said BLUD on it.
</p>
<p>
	Just as Sid turned back to look down to where he should have seen Gunk he saw a fist. And then blackness.
</p>
<p>
	Sid woke up on a couch inside of Flamingo HQ.
</p>
<p>
	"Good morning sunshine" Chic Pea said.
</p>
<p>
	"What..."
</p>
<p>
	"Some pale guy dropped you off and said you hit your head....pshhh as if"
</p>
<p>
	Sid quickly sat up checking his neck. 
</p>
<p>
	"Looking for hickies?" Chic Pea smiled. "Hawt" she said as she blew out a puff of purple smoke from a hookah.
</p>
<p>
	Sid sighed.
</p>
<p>
	"Don't worry Romeo....just rest today we got this" She patted him on the head like he was a puppy as she sashed out of the room. Sid sat with his head in his hands.
</p>
<p>
	"Duncan would have just unlocked the cuffs...." he said shaking his head.
</p>
<p>
	FIN
