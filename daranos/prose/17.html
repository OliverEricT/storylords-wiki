EP 17


8 Years Ago

	The southern regions of Daranos were hot. Like a two nickel whore on a Saturday night just lookin for a John to give a Mayonaise Hanglider to under the at the local sports bar. Heat waves rippled off of the dunes of the endless desert. Giant worms shot up  from the early morning sun to feast on mushcrabs as they scurried from their nightly hidy holes. Vultor birds circled around dying men as they gasped their last breaths in the unforgiving indiference of the wastelands. Outposts littered the desert and were home to some of the most villainous and smelliets degenerates ever seen since the last night I spent with yo mama at the local sports bar.

The Indiferent Wastes as they were named on maps gave way to a more colloquial name, The Shit Box, on account of this is where the Cat People reigned for thousands of years. Not many had been seen recently and their where-abouts where or lack there of, were a source of great dispute. Their number slowly dwindling.

The Bog Hole was a tavern located within one such of these outposts. It's western style swinging doors were symbolic of the swining ass BALLS one had to have to even enter this particular stink pit.

"OI" said the barkeep to a group of ogres fighting. "If you're gonna play grab ass at least go up stairs with the other whores I'm trynna sell GROG here". The ogres stopped and turned red as the entire bar laughed and cheers. "They love each other" a small gnome said in the back.

"Is that true" Said one of the ogres to the other.

"It always has been" replied the other and then they looked lovinglly into each other's 4 eyes. After that the entire front row of tables were slathered in ogre spit as they 4 way french kissed, each with two tongues, like this was some kind of even more pointless and idiotic Gallagher show. That's a reference you should ask your mom about but keep it down she probably has a headache from sloppin my top last night. In fact, go get your mom a powerade she's gonna need it.

Suddenly a howling wind blew through the entire building causing the ogres boners to shrink fast than my self esteem after looking in the mirror. The double swinging doors of the tavern blasted open causing a hush to overtake the rowdy patrons. Light spilled around a figure in teh door blinding all who looked. A silhouetted man...NAY a silhouetted CAT man stood in shadow as all could see his rippling ungulating biceps. Some wept at the shear bulk of this creature. Some dropped to their knees and asked whomever or whatever their particular god was for forgiveness positive that this would be their last day on this realm and they would never see a more manly and awe inspiring sight. The two ogres who were making out nutted instanstly.

"Mew" said the traveler as he dropped a giant mourning star down onto the wooden floor causing the floor to splinter and crack. 

"Buffcat" whispered one of the men and then passed out in the middle of his dice game of Cumquats.

Buffcat strolled up to the bar while his mace tail, which was dragging along the floor. The only other sounds that could be heard were the gasps of the awe struck patrons and 8 simultaneous slide whistle sound effects as the make out ogres 8 peeners (4 each) reached the end of their refractory period and again became hard as cold steel on a frosty winters morning.

"Mew" he said to the now cowering bartender. Just as quickly as he finished his sentence a mug of Shit Box grog slid across the bar into his ready and meaty hand. He picked it up and with 4 or 5 quick laps of his ripped as shit tongue, he quickly finished the drinking slamming the mug down on the bar causing everyone in the esteblishment to jump as if a gun was fired but that one rat from that other episode wasn't even in this episode.

Suddenly the swining doors flew open once again. The crowd again gasped expecting to see another legendary hero from before I got fired but instead all they got was a skinny dirty looking human man with a blade of grass in his mouth and a wide brim sun hat.

"Oh howdy yall" said the human farmer.

"Awwwww" the crowd said as they went back to their business and again the noises of the bar picked up like business as usual.

The farmer made his way to the bar and ordered.

"One ice cold milk please" he said to the barkeep. The barkeep just shook his head as those around in earing range just chuckled.

Buffcat slammed his paw down on the bar. "MEW" he said to the bartender and again another mug instantly slid across the bar this time filled with the same milk the farmer had ordered. Buffcat raised his glass and knodded at the farmer lapping up the creamy fluid so that droplets flew everywhre even on his cutie whiskers.

The farmer acknowledged the knod and also slammed back the cool milk leaving only a mustache of white similar to what your mama had last night after supping upon my new england manchowder.

"I'm lookin fer a brave adventurer" the farmer said loudly for all to hear. Again the crowd jeered and laughed.

"For what!? To clean out your cluck cluck coops ya damn farmin dingus" said a voice from the back. The crowd laughed.

"My Hammies have been goin missin and I think someone's a stealin them" the farmer replied undetered.

"Have you checked your mama's BUTT!?" said another heckler as the crowed OOOOO'd like it was 1980s Night at the Apollo.

Again Buffcat slammed  his paw down silencing the now raucus hecklers and witih a simple and firm "MEW" he looked at the farmer.

"Yer willin to help? Thats wonderful" the farmer said taking another swig of milk. Buffcat slammed the rest of his cream and the two left the saloon.

"Mew" Buffcat asked

"The names Calhoun" said the farmer as they arrived at his farm. It was an old and delapadated silt farm that was once used to sift silt for the once mighty Cat Empire to be used in their litter boxes. The finest silt was reserved for royalty to literally shit into but the pride of silt farmers never died even though their business had gone south since the disapearance of most of the Catkin.

"Mew" Buffcat said as he took up a position nearest to the barn. Inside were hammies and whoolies and gloats. In the rafters Buffcat could see Batples hanging and sleeping in the daylight sun. He had to restrain the natural intict to "Eckeckeckeck" at them but managed.


"I've been having to keep theses here hammies locked up all day and night on account of the theif just hornswaggling up and yoinkin them from out under my hair ass nose." Calhoun said with a chuckle. "I got no idea where they're coming from. I stayed up all night to try and see where or when they show up but they're like some kind of ninja school training spectre. I never see nothin and then POOF I open up the barn and some hammies gone AWOL."

"Meeewww" Buffcat said rubbing his cutie chin with a curious paw.

'If'n ya don't mind I should like to stay up with ya and keep watch tonight" Calhoun said "After the missus feeds us that is, then we can take up position and wait"

After a delicious dinner of left over hammie hocks and hooves stewed in silt broth the two men again took up position across from the barn in a trough hut. Calhoun whittled away at a stick he was carving into a smaller recreation of the stick he had been whittling on. Buffcat used this time to sharpen his claws as quietly as he couldd on the wooden pillars of the hut.

"So's you from around here?" Calhoun asked

"Mew" Buffcat said.

"YA don't say?" Calhoun replied excitedly.

"Mewmewmewmew" Buffcat went on

"Well dang son. I never thought of it like that. Really gives ya something to ponder over don't it?" Calhoun said setting down his whittle work. He squinted into the darkness as the chill of hte desert night started to effect him. Buffcat sat still and calm. His ears perked back listening in all directions for any sound out of the ordinary. Calhoun went to light his pipe but BUffcat held up a paw and thwacked it away. 

"Mewmewmew" he said shaking his adorable petable and marketable head. Through his eyes he could see everthing in the night. He had superb night vision and a smoldering cherry of a weed pipe would only serve to dampen one of his most hightened skills.

"You're right my bad friend" Calhoun relented and then put a wad of chewtack into his maw. The two sat in silence as Calhoun spat out blork onto the ground.

Suddenly Buffcat saw a flash from INSIDE of the barn. He squinted and looked through a cracked knot in the barn wall. Inside he saw a glinty golden shimmer.

"MEW" he said as he pulled on Calhoun's shirt. Calhoun, who was knodding off, woke with  a start and almost pissed pants if not for his sleep boner. The two then ran over to the barn. Buffcat snicked his claws out like a cooler more marketable Wolverine. Their metalic coverings shown bright in the moonslight as Calhoun fumbled with the barn lock. As he opened the door the two men jumped in expecting to see the culprit still holding a hammie, but instead there was only Gus the Gloat and silence.

"Baaaaah" Gus said as he chewed on a can.

"What in TAR FUCKIN NATION IS GOING ON HERE?" Calhoun said as he threw his sunhat to the ground and stomped on it like a stereotypical hill person from the stupid ages.

Buffcat sniffed the air and narrowed his eyes looking for any sign of the intruder. 

"They took Margereet, my prize hammie that won the hammie beauty pagent 2 years ago" Calhoun said as he started to cry. "That pig was prettier than my mama and she was a looker. Made a fortune doing 'under the table' work at the sports bar"

Buffcat moved over to a pile of hay. Usually he would enjoy rolling around in the hay and getting all the hay all over his orange fur but there was no time for that kind of carry on. With one swift swoosh of his mace tail he cleared the hay and low and behold lay a tunnel.

"Well paint my taint" Calhoun said in disbelief. "Never thought to look INSIDE the barn. What in the Hillstreet BLues could have made this tunnel? Sandworms don't come near people and they don't eat hammies..."

"Mew" Buffcat said.

"GULP" Calhoun gulped. "Ok let me grab a torch"

"Mewmew" Buffcat stopped him. He reached into his pouch and pulled out a small elongated jar of Fairy Flies. Inside the little bugs glowed a light green. As they were held the heat of buffcat's paws excited them to life and their green glow became a light to which they could see in the darkness.

"After ya'll" Calhoun said nervously.

Inside the tunnel the sand around hte walls was someone heated to a point where it became like glass. Calhoun ran his hand over it and it made a squeak sound.

"What in the Dildo Swaggins..." he said quietly.

"Mew" Buffcat responded with a claw to his lips.

As they went further and further down into the tunnel system they saw many forks and twists. Each time Buffcat would sniff the air and choose, hopefully, the correct path to unknown parts that awaited them.

Calhoun, being a farmer, was not used to this type of adventuring and was now chawing on his chaw at an 8th grade level which for hillbilly farmers is the equivalent of like 4 PHD's. I'm not judging because god damned if I remember how to do algebra. X equals who gives a fuckin fuck ya fucks nobody uses this shit.

Hours went by as they spelunked down into the unknown. Just like my dick did last night in your mama's cave system. Spelunked her natural wonders all night long. Finally the air began to become less musty and cum smellly as the two rounded a turn into a gigantic cavern. The walls shown clear and smooth. Expecting to see his lost hammies or at least SOMETHING Calhoun let out another exasperated hillbillism.

"Well cut my peener off and shove it up my own b-hole and call me self fuckin sally..." he said with a spit.

"Mew" Buffcat said scanning the room. Calhoun moved closer and held up the fairy fly lantern. The twinkling bugs zitted and flitted around inside the glass orb causing light to scatter randomly over the walls. The refletions of bugs hit the glass walls and shadows made for a play of frantic skittering insects. In the center fo the room was a lone pedestal. On it sat a carved stone tablet. The two moved closer to the pedestal but as they got closer they could see that it was not made out of any stone. Instead it was a fossilized dragon claw that had been severed from an ancient and powerful dragon. In its splayed fingers sat the tablet etched with ancient markings in a language no one spoke nor cared about. Kind of like French.

"Can you read this gobbledygook?" Calhoun asked.

"Mewmewmew" 

"Well LA DI DA Mr Fancy Pants Kitty Cat can read ancient texts AND lick his own b-hole. Must be nice, CITY BOY" Calhoun said jokingly although deep down dude really wanted to lick  his own butt. He could take or leave the reading part though.

"Mew mew mew mew mewmewmemwmemwmew" Buffcat began to translate as he ran his metalic claw over each passing word.

"It's a prophecy!" Calhoun shouted.

"Mew mew" Buffcat affirmed.

"You want me to read it in Daranosian English just in case anyone is listening who can't speak Cattish?" Calhoun randomly said for some reason who knows why?

"One Shall Emerge from the East

As a great foe from the deep

Covers Darans Land

They will emerge onto sand"

"Well put a cat suit on me and call me Cat Daddy while you spank me with a riding crop" Calhoun said.

"Mew" Buffcat replied.

As Buffcat finished reading he heard the faintest CLICK. The tablet clicked down into place. Suddenly the dragon claw clenched its ancient fist around the tablet AND Buffcats right paw. He wrenched his arm back pulling a shoulder muscled but remained stuck in the ancient grip of the titans stoney hand.

"SHIT BUTTER" Calhoun said coming closer to Buffcat's aid.

"MEWMEW" Buffcat shouted as he held out his other free hand urging Calhoun to stay where he was 

"Bootytraps..." Calhoun said. But it was too late. Calhoun had himself set foot too close to the pedastal and as the ground began to quake softlly at first, the sands on othe ground receeded to reveal a seal. Calhoun and Buffcat looked down to see an ancient symbol to which niether of them knew the origin of. As if on queue a whirring of mechanical noise started to sputter to life. Like a giant wind up toy the momentum of whatever was set into motion began slow and slowly picked up speed and intensity. Buffcat could only stand there helpless waiting for his fate. Calhoun however was starting to panic. He desperately wanted to save his new friend but he had a wife and hammies to look after. He looked at Buffcat and then turned to look at the entrance from which they came. He was torn but what COULD he do? If the strongest cutest cat in all of Daranos couldn't get away from the dragon's claw's grip how was he going to help?

Buffcat could see the terror and pain the decison was causing Calhoun and with a single bow of his head he could only say..."Mew".

"I can't leave you here!" Callhoun screamed over the now 150 plus decibel torrent of sound filling the room.

"MEW" Buffcat yelled. Calhoun looked at the entrance and back at his new friend who had been kind of enough to help him even though he didn't  have to. Finally he relented and turned to the exit and began to run looking back one more time as the sound itself began to ripple the air inside of whatever this room was. Fear took over as soon as he exited the room. He couldn't even piss himself since his own piss was being converted to adrenaline in the fear engine that was to fuel his mind and body. 

Back in the room Buffcat was pretty screwed. He was using all his strenght but to no avail. He tried using his mace tail but this dragon claw was fuckin hard as a midnight boner in spring time. He had one option left. He began to gnaw through his own forearm to free it from the claw. He bit down. Agony shot through his arm and injected itself into his brain. Primal pain and fear hit him. He continued to chew but he was just too buff. It would take some kind of steak eating champion to bite through all this manly muscle meat.

Then he began to think about his friends. The Steak Daddy himself Fred, his best friend. Ugla and Sid who he hadn't seen in a year. He thought about his kittens. His 69 lives flashed before his eyes. All of his adventures and triumphs. All of his disappointments and failures which now in the last seconds of life seemed like triumphs in and of themselves. Blood ran down the pedastals claws and hit the seal below. Drip drip drip.

Suddenlly the seal began to glow a brillian saphire. Buffcat closed his eyes both to shield them from the light and to shield his mind from the innevitable. 

"Mew" he sighed. All at once a blazing blue beam of magical superheated fire shot up from the entirety of the seal reaching to the cieliinig hundreds of feet above. Buffcat closed his eyes one last time.

In the tunnels Calhoun looked back and saw only the most brilliant blinding light he's ever seen. He began to cry out of fear and acknowledgement as to waht he knew in his heart was true. Another Catkin was gone.

He sprinted trying to remember through the fog of terror which way they had come from. He stopped in the middle of a room with 4 choices of tunnels. He panted and fell to his knees trying to remember which one was the way home. The sound of his breath and the ringing in  his ears were soon the only things he could hear. He panted and tried to get back up but suddenly he heard something else. A skittering.

At first it was quiet but all too soon a wave of primal fear shot through his mind again in direct proportion the wave of sound echoing through the tunnels. Like a million spiders running, clawing, groping over one another for purchase on the slick glassy walls. The blue of the light was now replaced with red. Thousands of red lights danced against the walls just as the fairy flies danced harmlessly on them only moments ago. The wave pushed in all directiions. Calhoun just stayed still no longer sure it mattered what directiion to go in for in every direction he heard death. And soon he saw it.


Fin.
