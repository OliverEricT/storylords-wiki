	EP 18
</p>
<p>
	The Pukes of Grahlzard
</p>
<p>
	Grahl is one fucked up sesspit of cum and villainy. Like the step dad you never asked for but then you hear him banging your mom. It's fucked up but deep down you respect it. But below the surface of Grahls pocked and pitted outer visage lay the seedy underbelly of its politcal arena. That's right fuckers. We're going attack of the clones over here so strap on your world building boners and lets get so beaurocratic it'll make your mama say "Boys, you need to file form 6969-420B in order to listen to Jerry bang me and don't forget to use only Black or Blue pens because we're gonna go all night long or until the union stops paying for Jerry's overtime".
</p>
<p>
	"DETECTIVE ROMAN" Screamed a portly old Dwarf from behind his playschool size desk. "GET IN HERE! NOW!"
</p>
<p>
	Detective Chad Roman of the P.O.D.s (Paladins of Daranos) along with his Dogman Partner Stank Dankleson walked into Mayor Grog Hoggly's office and stood at firm attention. Stank's occasiaonal nervous twitch the were only movements for what seemed like hours as the two got ready for the reaming of a lifetime and once Chad went undercover at the Ream Dream a pegging club.
</p>
<p>
	"You two have really done it this time" The Mayor began as he stood up to tower below the  2 by a good 3 feet.
</p>
<p>
	"And by really done it I mean really HAVEN"T DONE SHIT ABOUT ANY OF THESE GANGS TAKING OVER MY CITY" He yelled as frothy spit flew from his mouth and landed on their knee area. The two nevertheless squinted and winced as the spray of what could only be described as "hot mold" hit their bare legs since the PODs recently switched to Hot Pant style shorts for the summer months.
</p>
<p>
	"Sir if I may..." Chad tried to interject
</p>
<p>
	"(WHINY MOCKING VOICE) SIR IF I MAAAAAY WAH WAH WAH. CAN IT ROMAN. All of our fronts have been exposed. These FLAMINGOS are poised to take over the entire underworld. They've recently dispatched the Dogmen and they've been pulling jobs like this was Rubby night at Sir Tugs-o-lot Massage and Happy Ending Emporium"
</p>
<p>
	Both Chad and Stank side eyed each other both thinking they'd have to look into whether or not this was a real place or not just as the Mayor slammed his meaty fist down onto his desk causing them them to startle and snap back into attention.
</p>
<p>
	"Grahls been nominated for 'Most Corrupt City and/or Borough 8 straight years in a row and I'll be DAMNED if we're not gonna win it this year. We can't have some vigilanty group running around making the Paladins look like they can't do their jobs or that they only are interested in donuts or that their fascist pig dogs who racially profile or that they'll stab anyone with their flaming swords for even looking at them twice or that we recruit sub 75 IQ level Paladins so they don't ask too many questions about our draconian tactics or...
</p>
<p>
	This went on for another 20 or so minutes as the Mayor listed every reason that we here at Bros always say ACAB. 1312 mother fucks.
</p>
<p>
	"I want results Detectives. And if you two can't get those for me I'll be forced to fire you WITH FULL PENSION so that you can sit around for the rest of your miserable lives living off of people's hard earned taxes thinking about all the times you got away with illegal shit and doing whatever you want as free men basically getting paid to sit at home and contributing nothing to the force when you COULD BE out here busting skulls for laughs."
</p>
<p>
	The Mayor breathed in deeply to catch his breath.
</p>
<p>
	"Uhhh boss that doesn't sound too ba..." Stank began.
</p>
<p>
	"Dankleson I SWEAR IF YOU FINISH THAT SENTENCE I'LL CUT TONGUE OUT AND USE IT AS A SHAMMY TO WASH MY YACHT"
</p>
<p>
	Stank gulped and fell back into a stiff attention.
</p>
<p>
	"The annual Poonta Eve race is this weekend and I swear if those Flamingos even get a stanky WHIFF of the finish line alive I'll use both of your scalps as mirkens" The Mayor huffed and puffed as he relit a Old Stogey which had already been half smoked.
</p>
<p>
	"So you two better stop playing GRAB ASS out there and figure out how to make these guys deader than my wife's labido and get your damn dicks out of each other's mouths"
</p>
<p>
	"YEAH BECAUSE ITS POONTA EVE NOT POONTA STEVE" Shouted Stank as both the Mayor and Chad Roman slowly turned to him in disgust.
</p>
<p>
	"ANYYYYYWAY" the Mayor went on. "Get out of here before I'm sick of looking at your stupid idiot faces."
</p>
<p>
	"YES SIR" the two lackies say in unicen and leave the room as the Mayor unzips his tuxedo pants and starts to jerk off to his Mayor sash.
</p>
<p>
	Back at Flamingos headquarters a loud CLANG followed by "MOTHER TRUCKIN SHIT!" could be  heard coming from the garage.
</p>
<p>
	"You're like...supposed to use that wrench on the van not your toes" Chic Pea said to her brother who was under the Bone Van.
</p>
<p>
	"Thank you sister. You are so much wiser and smarter than me." Peppercorn replied.
</p>
<p>
	"Don't forget hotter." She said as she spun around on one of those little round shop chairs that spin around.
</p>
<p>
	"Isn't it the idea for a criminal gang of organized well...CRIMINALS to stay out of hte public eye and not draw attention to ourselves" Fred said as he rolled out from under the bone van on one of those shop rolly things that let you sleep under cars.
</p>
<p>
	Duncan sat in the corner working on some rudimentary tube based electronic device. It sparked as he put it down.
</p>
<p>
	"Joey thinks its time we made a bigger splash here in the Big Batpple. Poonta Eve will get our names out there and I konw we have the best getaway driver in the whole damn city so we can win this thing. Besides we're bonding" 
</p>
<p>
	Gunk rolled out from under the van right next to Fred.
</p>
<p>
	"Duncan's right. I am the best getaway driver in the whole WORLD" he said proudly
</p>
<p>
	"He said city" Chic Pea corrected.
</p>
<p>
	"Motion to ban Chic Pea from the garage forever" Gunk said holding up a hand
</p>
<p>
	Chic Pea rolled her eyes and went back to the important job of spinning in her seat.
</p>
<p>
	"When we finsh these upgrades our baby here is gonna be a force to reckon with" Duncan said slapping the side of the bone van. As he did he ran his hands over the old decal they had on the side that said "Flamingo Laundry and Delivery Service"
</p>
<p>
	"She could use a new coat of paint and a new logo though" He went on.
</p>
<p>
	"Pin Up Girl" Fred said immediately. "Chic Pea could model"
</p>
<p>
	"You like couldn't afford my modeling fee" She said mid spin.
</p>
<p>
	"Same" Gunk said from under the van.
</p>
<p>
	"ROLL HER OUT" Stank said with a weird doggly giggle
</p>
<p>
	Chad Roman revved the mag-busticle mana engine hard as he grabbed a human skull gear shifter and shifted into a forward gear. All around outside of POD headquarters motorpool every officer stood waiting for the departments new toy to be unveiled. This is how they were gonna get those filthy flamingos they all thought wihtout questioning why they were even going after these guys because they were all bootlicking piss babies.
</p>
<p>
	As the vehicle exited the garage their piss baby mouths were agape at the shear size of the object they saw moving slowly toward them. On the side painted in blood red were the letters TRGW.
</p>
<p>
	"Behold" the mayor said from a pulpit talking into an all see ball. "The Truckasaurus Rex Galvanized Versitile Vehicle" As he finished he flourished his tiny arms toward the TRG...W? Wait a minute...
</p>
<p>
	"Dankleson its supposoed to be 2 V's not a W you absolute cock licking ass for brains" The mayor scolded.
</p>
<p>
	"Whats the difference boss? 2 v's make a W I was saving time. It's like math or something" Stank said as he tongue panted.
</p>
<p>
	"Dankleson" another officer said. "You're not one of those degens who makes pointed double u's for the lower case W are you."
</p>
<p>
	"Sure why not?" 
</p>
<p>
	"You make me sick Dankleson" the officer said after a moment and then spit on teh ground near Stanks foot.
</p>
<p>
	This thing was massive. The TRGW was the size of a monster truck and made out of the ancient bones of a flightless dragon some called a "Dinosaucer". It's hull was almost impenetrable. On the front was the gaping maw of the terrible lizard who's visage was now merely a hood ornament for this instrument of destruction. It was painted all black and flew the Daranosian flag behind it but instead of the usual colors of the rainbow it was black and blue and said "POD lives Matter". 
</p>
<p>
	As the truck rumbled and revved the PODs each began to shout "POD POD POD" like the USA chant but stupider somehow. You know at least one of those guys was chanting it thinking they were chanting for the early 2000s christian numetal band P.O.D.
</p>
<p>
	"Awwww I was" Said an officer from the back as he kicked a rock and left with his head down his armor clanging.
</p>
<p>
	Back at the Flamingos garage Gunk turned the skeleton key and the Flamingo Bonevan stuttered.
</p>
<p>
	"Don't mana drain it!" Fred shouted from under the hood
</p>
<p>
	Gunk turned the key again and delicately used his foot on the mana pedal which was in the shape of a bigfoots foot. Soon the van started to life and rumbled loudly slowly purring.
</p>
<p>
	"SHE'S LIKE BRAND NEW" Peppercorn shouted from inside the van at his all see-puter station. Fred slammed the hood and patted it with satisfaction. Duncan stood outside as he heard his beautiful bone beast baby  rumble to life. Chic Pea was using magic to form a portal from which Joey Pizza walked out of.
</p>
<p>
	"I see uh you're van is lookin straight outta da A Team" He said chewing on a pepperoni for no reason whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
	"The what?" Chic Pea asked raising an eyebrow.
</p>
<p>
	"You know da A Team. They were Grahls first Poonta champs. They won like 69 times and then went completely vigilante justice after coming back from da Vietgnome War."
</p>
<p>
	As the van rolled out of its garage Duncan smiled proudly. She was jacked. Her ass end was lifted up with fat booty ass tires like your mamas ass end was lifted up last night when I filmed our yearly all see xxxmas card with her. Granny's in for a surprise this year.
</p>
<p>
	She was pure silver. No paint. Just the bones sanded down to the bone metal. Oh yeah everthing made out of bones is also metal. Like figuritivly and literal as in, its metal that things are made  out of bones and that the bones themselves are from ancient horrors whose bones were literally metalic in nature. This isn't kiny garten you get it.
</p>
<p>
	On the side the crew indeed went with the pinup motif. There stood half naked on a beach a busty comely orc babe in a bikini with a stein of mead in one hand and holding onto a stripper pole in the other. And behind her was the legendary bird The Flamingo pulling at her g string and pulling it down just so you could see her green ass crack like that suntan lotion giving you the reminder that  you should have a boner because her ass crack is hot.
</p>
<p>
	"Sweet Orc Jesus" Joey said looking to the side like in Star Trek.
</p>
<p>
	Duncan smileed and patted Joey on the back. He ran toward his bone baby and got in the front seat as Fred climbed into the back. Chic Pea waved her staff and closed the portal as she herself got into the sliding door on the side of the van and off they went.
</p>
<p>
	"Wait a second" Joey said looking around the now empty lot. "How da hell am I gonna get home? I got chores do to." He said confusingly as dust flowed around him.
</p>
<p>
	"Aye Mallone" he said looking from side to side like that Pulp Fiction gif.
</p>
<p>
	As the racers lined up on the corner of 1st and 2nd streets the bustle of the city nearly came to a halt. Everyone gathered to watch the annaul illegal drag race that was a staple of Grahl. Since the  Daranosian Wizard council didn't sanction this event on account of htem not being around anymore, anything went in this race. You could literally do anything to win. "Drag Race" was merely a suggestion as you could take side streets or even go underground if you could. Nothing mattered. This race was gonna be like Thanksgiving at your inlaws. Long and innapropriate.
</p>
<p>
	The Flamingos pulled up in their designated positions and revved the newly rebuild Semi 420 Mana Induction Combusticator in such a way that surely some panties got wet and some boners released some pre cum.
</p>
<p>
	The remaining Dogmen crew rolled up in their smaller but more manueverable dog house karts. Kind of like Snoopy's house mixed with a mario kart. On the back they had a co pilot who would be dealing out major damage with lances and staves and swords and anything really that could hurt or kill you. The Orc Mafia showed up in their black bone-limos. They never tried to win they just sat in the back hot tup and sipped champy and tossed out candy and jewels to the kids. It was kind of like a parade for them. 
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly the  ground began to rumble. The crowd fell silent. 
</p>
<p>
	"GROUND QUAKE" yelled a drunk hobo as he ran and braced himself up against his cardboard shanty's doorway. Piss leaking from his peener. But from around the corner everyone heard the COP national anthem "Bad Boys: Theme From the Show Cops" by Inner Circle. It got louder and louder until finally a tank of a bonetruck rolled up to the starting line.
</p>
<p>
	Over the All Noise loud speaker Chad Roman began to speak. "NOTHIN TO SEE HERE FOLKS MOVE ALONG MOVE ALONG" 
</p>
<p>
	"I dont know about all that" a bystander said as everyone began to grumble.
</p>
<p>
	"LAIDES AND GENTLEMEN AND PODS" the announcer began to speak. "START YOUR MANA COMBUSTICATORS!!!!!"
</p>
<p>
	As he finished the roar of bonecars filled the streets. The smell of burn mana and oil stung everyones nostrils. Except for the Pixie Consortium who's bubble cars only emitted a scent of fresh laundry and strawberries and creme.
</p>
<p>
	"LETS KILL THESE MOTHER FUCKERS" shouted a pixie driver as she lowered old timey goggles over her cute little face as bubbles popped and sputtered out of her bubble car.
</p>
<p>
	A hot orc stood in front of everyone with hankerchief. She was ready to drop the flag and start the race when she accidentally dropped iit too early. 
</p>
<p>
	"Ooopsy" she said bending over seductively as her donkey badonk hiney pointed at the racers. She gave that big booty a slap and shorty started the race race race race.
</p>
<p>
	"YEEEEE HAW" shouted a Hillbilly as he hamboned it up in the crowd like this was a real life NASCAR race in real life America circa now.
</p>
<p>
	The PODs new destructo craft was slow to start though. Allowing eveeryone to pass while sitting idle at the starting line.
</p>
<p>
	"I don't know about all that" said that one guy again suspicioius as one should always be of anyone in authority.
</p>
<p>
	The Flamingos were off to a great start however. They edged passed the Pixie Bubble Car and used the natural draft of their fragrant bubbles to pull up right behind one of the Dog Man Karts. The dogman on the back turned around and began to wildly hack at the front of the bonevan with an axe. It did nothing.
</p>
<p>
	"Be sure to spay and neuter your pets" Duncan said as he climbed out the side window and aimed his pistol at the Karts back right wheel. With a single shot he hit his mark sending the dogmen flying off the cart as the kart itelf flipped over like that one nazi guy in Indiana Jones 3 when he gets that post stuck in his front wheel. It probably would have been more humane to just shoot the guy but eeh whatever. Years later the dog man's puppy son would be addicted to Giggle Dirt and resort to turning tricks on the street for gold. Like he would sit or stand on command and do that one trick where he keeps a treat on his nose until the person says its ok to eat it then he would eat it off of his own nose.
</p>
<p>
	The Flamingos were in good position as they passed the Dwarf district. But that was about to change. From behind them Peppercorn was seeing chaos. The TRGW had indeed began to move and was now trailing the entire race field by only a few yards.
</p>
<p>
	"What the hell are they doing" Chic Pea wondered out loud looking at her brothers all see screen. On top of the van a magical turret held an all see ball so that Peppercorn could scan around them 369 degrees.
</p>
<p>
	"GET EM GET EM" Stank shouted in the passenger seat as the TRGW rolled up behind the Orc Mafia's limo. The enormous tires of the Truckasaurus literally tearing up the road as they went. 
</p>
<p>
	"Da hell is that?" Said an Orc turning his head to look behind him careful to  not spill his bubbly into the hot tub. But it was too late. Just as he saw what it was his and the fate of the Orc Mafia limo were sealed. The TRGW rolled right over them. It smashed the rear end of the car like I smashed yo mamas rear end last night with my TRGW. And just like last night there were no survivors.
</p>
<p>
	The  TRGW went through the limo like hot jizz through one ply toilet tissue. One child who was gathered around for the candy the orcs were throwing picked up the severed hand of the Orc Don, it still clutching a piece of candy as his big giant diamond ring glinted in the sun.
</p>
<p>
	"Cooooooooool Orc Don Kissin hand" the kid said as he kissed the ring.
</p>
<p>
	"We have a problem" Peppercorn shouted up to the cockpit. Duncan turned around to see behind them. Not only were there about 2 dozen dog men karts hell bent on revenge for what Dunan himself did to their pack leader but the entire PODs force was behind them having been joined by every POD squadbonecar in the city.
</p>
<p>
	People began to cheese it hard as the fuzz was now up everyones assholes ruining  Poonta Eve. A dude swallowed  his entire cache of giggle dirt in one go and saw his ancestors. 
</p>
<p>
	The PODs were out for blood. What else was new thought Duncan.
</p>
<p>
	"FRED!" Duncan shouted to the back. "ITS TIME"
</p>
<p>
	"Oh HELL YEAH" Fred said as he shouldered a giant steampunk ass looking tube. It was one of Peppercorn's newest inventions. The Blunderzooka. Using Chic Peas portal magic he could fit any number of objects, usually trash, into a shell that when fired would spray anyone with death. Literally it was 10lbs of shit in a 5lb bazooka shell.
</p>
<p>
	Fred lined up the sight and fired at the nearest dog kart. The THUMP of the zooka shook even Fred's sturdy manly musclular body as out of the front of the weapon appeared a bowling ball.
</p>
<p>
	"FUCKIN BOWLING BALL BRO?" Fred turned to Peppercorn as Peppercorn just shrugged.
</p>
<p>
	As the bowling ball  hit the dog kart driver it smashed through his little dog windshield who's white leather interior instantly became red with brain and blood.
</p>
<p>
	Fred loaded another round as he took aim at one of the POD squadcars. He fired and out shot dozens of silver forks and knives and spoons. Fred sighed disappointed as they embedded themselves into the front end of the bone car doing no damage.
</p>
<p>
	"That was like our Gam Gam's fine cutlery!" Chic Pea shouted at her brother.
</p>
<p>
	"We were  never going to use it Chic. We're Willenials!" Pep shouted back.
</p>
<p>
	All around them more and more POD cars were pouring out from the side streets now chasing the clear leader of the race The Flamingos. Behind them Chic Pea saw the TRGW getting closer and closer now mowing over even their own guys with the recklessness and uncaring thought only a Pig could have.
</p>
<p>
	Chic Pea looked over to the side of the van where a big red glowing button shown through the darkness of the inner van.
</p>
<p>
	"Fuck it" she said and used her staff to hit the button high above her.
</p>
<p>
	"FUCK YESS" Gunk said looking in the rear view all seer.
</p>
<p>
	Chic Pea stood near the side sliding door with her arms out in a T pose. Through the open back doors she could see the TRGW coming closer. She closed her eyes and her brothers magmum Opus began to assemble itself around her.
</p>
<p>
	Clanking and clicking and whirring stirred as the sliding van door slid open. A soft seat cradled her as she slid out of the door on a turret. In front of her the mechanisms of Peppercorn's genius mind unfolded in perfect construction. Soon she was sitting in the Staffling Gun. A mirriad of 12 different magical staffs put together in a circle spun as she warmed up the weapon with the push of a trigger. The TRGW closed in range just as the Staffling Gun began to fire. Out shot fire bolts, Ice bolts, lightning bolts, arcane magic missile bolts, and bolts of varying magic that even Chic Pea didn't know Peppercorn had added. 
</p>
<p>
	A lowely POD car manage to get in the way of the hellstorm of bolts and was struck with like 56 different kinds of magic at once. The bonecar explooded as the TRGW just rolled right through it taking the bolts on its front end. Ice lances stuck out of the hood (or BONNET if iyou're some kind of British weirdo) as the TRGW rolled closer and closer. Chic Pea again pulled the trigger and let loose another barage of magical death. One stray green bolt ricochetted off of the TRGW and hit a POD riding a bonehorse instantly turning him into a frog. Years later just as he would begin to come to terms with his new life as a frog some random Rat would do a drive by and kill him with a GUN!??!? Where the hell did this rat get a gun would be this frog guys last thought as he died alone. As a frog.
</p>
<p>
	"SHIT" Chic Pea said as she retracted the Staffling gun backinto the van.
</p>
<p>
	"We're almost at the city limits" Gunk shouted.
</p>
<p>
	"This is nine ways to fuckday" Duncan said.
</p>
<p>
	As they reached the city limit the TRGW and all the other PODs began to slow
</p>
<p>
	"KILL THEM BEFORE THEY GET TO THE CITY LIMIT" Shouted the Mayor over the all see ball.
</p>
<p>
	As the Flamingos passsed the city limit sign that read "Grahl The Big Batpple: Hope you enjoyed your stay!" But with the word stay crossed out and replaced with the word "GAY" they had won the Poonta race. But they had lost a home. 
</p>
<p>
	The TRGW came to a skidding halt as both Chad Roman and Stank got  out and threw their metal Paladin helmets onto the ground and kicked at the dirt.
</p>
<p>
	"SHIT BALLS" Chad shouted.
</p>
<p>
	"SHITTY SHIT SHIT SHEEEEEIIIIIIITT" Stank added as he kicked his helmet and broke his toe.
</p>
<p>
	The Flamingos sat in silence in shock as to what had just happened. Since when were the PODs THIS openly corrupt? Grahl was by no means perfect but the PODs usually let everyone just chill and be cool. Now they were narcing out like the lances up their butts just got shoved up there another 12 inches.
</p>
<p>
	"The Mayors gonna be pissed" Chad said looking at Stank.
</p>
<p>
	"Wanna make out about it?" Stank said waggling his eye brow
</p>
<p>
	"Not until we get home" Chad said shooing him away.
</p>
<p>
	FIN
</p>
