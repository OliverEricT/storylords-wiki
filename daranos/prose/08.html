Prompts: Masks & Autopsies
by Josh Henderson

The nights in Daranos were long. Longer than my totally real giant peener. They were also dark. Darker than my totally real Big Black Cave that I often sit in and cry. Manly tears. You know...tears for fallen brothers in combat or because its 1am and I haven't even started my story for Bros B4 Prose yet. But mostly manly tears. The cave is dark my friends. 

Outside of Daranos's many city walls safety was not to be found. To be fair inside the city walls safety was often not to be found. Like that time Gliberty Trunkle, a local Blobbit, tried to set her pubes on fire in protest to the Daranosian voting height limit. "YOU MUST BE AT LEAST THIS TALL TO VOTE AND TO RIDE THE DONKEYS" said the signs all over the city. Needless to say Gliberty burnt down much of the city of Kaz A'Doodle and is where the term "fire crotch" orignated. But ANYWAY....

Out in the forests anything could happen at any time. Monsters crept through the woods at night and did whatever the fuck they wanted. Cutpurses were ever present and they'd steal your gold faster than I stole your mama's sweet coochie loot last night. The faries and brownies all were careful to hide away in their little tree and mushroom houses or whatever whimsical fucking bullshit they like to live in. Murkmunks didn't dare shout out of their tiny windows for fear of what they may bring a callin' plus their son has swim lessons in the morning and if he doesn't get a good 16 hours of sleep you know how cranky HE gets. 

The only creatures stirring late into the night were usually those up to no darn good. Except for the Nightscrub brothers. Artleby and Galem Nightscrub were Wood Elves. But unlike their other kin they did not spent time in trees doing elf stuff like eating leaves or putting moss in their pantaloons because fuck it who's gonna stop em? No...these two brothers owned a small cottage where they ran their "business". What was their business? Well...anything and everything. No questions asked. Some say they were graver robbers and others say they were...well they said they were grave robbers too but also they did other things. Galem was a practiced alchemist and Artleby was good at like...digging and filling in holes? A pretty good skill to have when you're cottage is in the middle of nowhere and nobody is around to ask questions like "Where is my dead uncle's body?" or "Why do you have a stack of severed feet next to your firewood" or "Hey you grave digger elf...why aren't you as cool and big as the Monster Truck Gravedigger?"

"Art!" yelled Galem from the dank basement. "Art. Bring me the raw leech cum. I need to seal up this nasty wound"

Art fumbled down the wooden ladder that served as bobo ass stairs to the basement tripping at the final leg due to he being on his final leg. He lost his leg and now a wooden stump replaced the space where his other, favorite leg once was. But why wasn't he a pirate? Jesus not everyone with one leg and one eye and one hand has to be a pirate. You see any oceans around these woods? Get your shit together you fuckin racists.

"Here you are brother" said Art handing Galem a vile of nasty ass leech jizz. On the table next to him lay an uncouncious orc with a gash over his eye. Green blood was oozing out of the wound which was already begining to stink of decay. Art held back a gag as the smell hit his elfish nostrils. Elfs could smell as keenly as dogs some have said but if you ask me I'd rather have an elf  hump my leg ANY DAY of the week.

Galem thumbed the cork off the vile and slowly poured the yellowish fluid over the orc's cut. Immediately the bleeding was slowed as the leech seed began to coagulate into the cut and sizzled as it killed any germs and any last shred of dignity this orc ever had since he just got money shotted by a vile of leech cum like it was Spring Break at Degenerate Camp.

"Alright wake him up" Galen commanded Art.

"OI WAKE UP" Art shouted into the orc's ear hole.

"Not that way you idiot. Use the salts" Galen said as he slapped Art's arm and pointed to the cabinet.

Art fumbled over to the cabinet and took out a jar that said "Boner Salts". He held the jar under the orcs nostrils until he shot up awake with the hugest boner his 6 dicks ever had.

"That'll be 5 gold Glonk my boy" Galem said holding out his hand expectidly.

"Here's a tenner" said the Orc as he ran his hand over Galem's seductively. As he made his way out he turned around and winked. The Boner Salts had kicked the fuck in.

"We need more jobs" Galem said as he put the gold piece into his Boar Bank labled "Galem's $ $ COOL S"

"We could always make a trip to the late night body dispensery?" Art said waggling his eyebrows.

"Nahh. The townies are getting suspicious. I sold Old Missus Gumbrow back her dead husband's wedding band. I dont think she noticed on account of her being a complete moron but we gotta keep a low profile out here, Arty" 

Suddenly a loud thud was heard upstairs on the large wooden front door. 

"COME QUICK" a child's voice yelled.

The two brothers rushed up the ladder and opened the door. There stood little Chilly Wiggins, a troll boy who lived down on Clump Lane. Kid was a spaz. Are we allowed to call fictional characters spaz's? I dont know anymore.

"You guys" Chilly said out of breeth. "You guys wanna see a cool dead body?" He wheezed out.

Art and Galem followed Chilly down to the river. The riverbed was as dry as your mama's coochie loot. Nobody could remember a time when the river or your mama had been so dry. Not in recent memoroy anyway.

"Look" Chilly pointed down into the dry river. "A cool naked dead lady"

Down in the dry river lay the most beautiful elven goddess anyone had ever seen. This, of course, was before All See Ball Porn so seeing a naked lady alive or dead was a newsworthy event.

The moon shown off of her pale white skin almost reflecting it back in irredecent flecks. Like her skin was crystal. He hair was short and but golden. For the sake of respecting the dead lets just say she was a solid New York 12. 

"So what will you give me for it" Chilly said holding his hand out.

"How about I don't tell your mama your'e down here at night practicing your necromancy" Galem said kicking Chilly in his butt. "Now get out of here"

"Awwwww" Chilly said kicking a rock down into the river bed. "I was hoping I could practice some alchemy or maybe even necrophelia with you guys"

"No its....GET OUT OF HERE" Galem yelled.

THUD!

The body was heaver than it looked. It slumped down onto the basement workshop table.

"Should we look for gold teeth?" Art questioned.

"Nah no point. Light Elves don't get cavities." Galem replied. He covered the body up with a dirty tarp and wondered what they were going to do with this creature.

"I wonder how she died..." Art stared into her closed eyes. It was like she was sleeping. Her body wasn't stiff from rigor nor was it even cold. She couldn't have been dead long.

"WELP" Galem said breaking the silence. "As the town's Official Grave diggers and unofficial coroners I say we perform an autopsy"

"Ok but why would anyone want a body with our signatures on it...besides I can't even read all good" Art said like an idiot.

"No...we cut the body open to see how she died" Galem said firmly.

"Ok should we sterilize ourselves and put on masks?" Art asked.

Galem and Art looked at each other and finally both began to howl with laughter.

"Ahhhh man wear masks" Galem final spat out whiping a tear of laughter from his eye. "Good one brother"

Hours passed as they readied for their makeshift basement surgery. Hatchets and bone saws and all kinds of pokey and proddy little metal spikes were laid out. Galem took a large sharp knife and slit the corpse down the chest making a large Y shaped cut. He spread her skin off over her ribs. As he did he saw the bone cage glisten in the candle light. 

"Whoaaa" Art said stunned. "Her bones...they're gold"

"Yes" Galem agreed. He took a large plyer and gripped one of the ribs. With all his might he tried to pry the "bone" out of the cage but it didn't move. It didn't even scuff. This was like some kind of hard as fuck gold.

"I've heard legends of Light Elves who are truly ancient having bones like this. When they would get really really old they're bones would turn into precious metals. They were said to be unkillable...at least really hard to kill."

"But Gale" Art thought hard for a second which was longer than he had ever done before. "She can't be old...she's not stiff...and I mean...she might not be stiff but I sure am look at her! She's a fuckin Graal 13 and that's with her chest skin flapped over the sides of her."

"I know Art" Galem sighed. "Lets...we need some help with this one. Lets get some shut eye and wait until morning and try to find out where she came from."

Art and Galem washed their hands in dirty water that was now golden with blood. Yes. Golden with blood. As the blood solidified it slowly turned to flecks of gold. They slowly blew out the candles in the workshop. The room became dark. A draft blew through the window. As they approached the ladder upstairs a loud THUD was heard.

The two brothers stopped dead in the tracks. Eyes as wide as your mama's booty hole last night. They slowly turned their heads back toward the body.  THUD!

"HEY BOYS" a voice from upstairs shouted. "Sorry for the late night delivery but here's those giant stones you ordered for quote "keepin secrets where they should be kept Down in the swamp" said the voice.

"You're probably sleeping so I'll just leave these giant stones on the cellar door" THUD THUD.

"NOOOOOOO" the brothers yelled in unicen. But it was too late. Old Trog, the local delivery Ogre had his iBall phonagraphs in his ears and couldn't hear them. He whistled as he walked out  of the door.

The two brothers looked at each other. One afraid and one annoyed.

"Great now we're stuck down here" Galem said pissy like a bitch.

"What if we starve to death!" Art said begining to freak out like a bitch.

"Quiet" Galem said slapping his brother across the face. "We have plenty of food down here besides we can All See Ball someone to teleport us out of here in the morning. We'll sleep on the cots we put patients on. You get the bloody one" Galem said taking the clean cot.

After a while the night became quiet. Like too quiet. Nothing could be heard outside. The onlly sound was Art's snoring. Galem tossed to face toward the still open cadaver on the table in the center of the room. 

"Stupid Art and his stupid deviated septum stupid snoring stupid ogre"

Art let out a loud snore and then a fart and then gigled to himself in his sleep.

Galem settled back down and adjusted a blanket over himself. His eyes fell on the beautiful creature on the table. Sleep began to take him as his eyes closed slowly....slowly.....slowly. Just as he was about back to sleep he saw it. The tarp...PSSSH. It moved. Galem's eyes shot open now more awake than if he had gone on a gigle dirt bender. Did...did the tarp move? Nah he was just sleeping. He was seeing things.  He readjusted his position and again tried to will himself back to sleep. Slowly....slowly.....slowly his eyes got heavier until finally sleep.

BANG!

Galem's eyes shot open again. Ok...what the fuck was that? He looked over to the table and saw the body was still there. Exploding head syndrome? Yeah that was it. But wait....he thought. There he saw it. A pristine beautifully manicured feminine elfish hand. But the  tarp was over the whole body. No. He was asleep he was dreaming this. WAKE UP he demanded of himself but he could not move. Not at all. Not physically. 

Galem reset his eyes back on the now exposed hand. It twitched. Galem gasped. Fear krept into his throat. Slowly like acid it burned its way up to his vocal chords where when it reached seemed to burn the scream right out of his lungs. The hand twiched again. Galem felt piss swell in his balls. Slowly the hand began to move more freelly. Galem was still paralyzed with fear? Or maybe a spell? It didn't matter he was not moving when every atom in his body said "GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE DUDE".

The hand stiffened itself and made like a claw. A beautiful hand now stiffened to the point where the bones were visable and thats when it rotated. Not in the natural way a beings hand would turn but the counter clockwise on the joint. The sound of cracking and scraping metal muted only by a thin layer of the softest skin anyone had ever touched. The hand turned and turned and turned. It went around 360 degrees then slowly it raised a lone middle finger at Galem. Like the hand SAW him. 

Finally Galem let out a scream. At this the body lurched upward. SItting upright like it was alive.

"SHUT UP GALEM I'm eatin the cake" Art said in his sleep.

The corpse mechanically moved its head toward the two brothers. Stiff quick movements. Like a cart wheel that had seized up and been greased. The head jutted toward Galem its eyes still closed. The body wrenched itself upward again. Like it was stretching off a thousand years of sleep. It's arms moved robotically. It's spine contracted and expanded. The tarp now falling toward the floor as the body rose off the table.

Galem was now fully piss pants terrified. The corpse walked toward him as if frames of reality had been deleted. It moved so unnaturally yet smoothly that reality itself began to melt around Galem just like the corpses once amazing breastes now melted off the corpse like wax from a burning candle. Inside the body red light eminated from the chest cavity. The red light slowly throbbed up into the neck and then into the head until from behind the closed eyes Galem could see only 2 red dots. Then the eyes slowly opened. The dots were now beams of red piercing into Galems brain. The right eye melted out of the socket like a Hershey Kiss in a kids pocket on a summer day. Golden viscous liquid ran down the once beautiful cheek like a tear. 

"what.....what the fuck are you" Galem finally got the courage to ask.

The corpse wheezed and sputtered like it was adjusting a gear.

"Ooooooold" it finally said. "I am OOOOOOOLD"

More of the flesh was melted off the body now. The smell of burn hair and metal and skin was finally enough to wake Art

"WHO BURNT THE CAKE" he yelled himself awake and then little girl screamed so high pitched that a glass broke in a murkmonks house but like I said before he wasn't gonna yell about that some shit was going down tonight and my dude wanted NO part of it.

"Give me your light" said the corpse. "Give me your light" "Give me your light" "Give me your light" it repeated. "Give me your light"

Suddenly every candle in the workshop lit up ten times brighter than seemed possible. The smell of burning flesh and metal now mixed with the smell of burning wood as the candles lit the cottage aflame.

Art and Galem finally finding an ounce of courage ran for the cellar door. They pounded on it. They BEGGED it to open. They knew it was futile.

"GIVE ME UR LIGHT" the being said again and again.

Art and Galem's fingers bled raw from scratching at the door. Lines of bloody and nail and skin carved into the wood. They didn't even feel it as the panic and fear overrid any sense of pain. Their very bones scraping away spinter by splinter the door that lay between them and whatever horror this was.

Finally the flesh had all fallen ot the floor. Now stood a golden skeleton of meat and sinue. From within the hissing and chittering and sounds of gears clanging could be heard. The red eyes now moved down what was left of the throat inton what was left of the chest. With whirring power it pried open the 4th and 5th rib. Long Golden legs reached out. Eight of them. 

The End.

Some say the brothers had a fued and burned their own cottage down in an arguement. It was the talk of the town for awhile. Of course that didin't explian the hole that was left in the ground. It also didn't explain where their bodies were. Sure the fire could destroy them but thats one hot fire and the brothers didn't have a smelt. In reality its probable their hearts exploded from fear saving them from whatever fate the thing had in store for them. Or...not.
