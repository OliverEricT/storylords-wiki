	As the sun rose...rised? Is it rose or rised? Risened? Anyway as the sun peaked over the horizon of <a href="/daranos/locations/daranos">Daranos</a> nary a <a href="/daranos/creatures/mirkmonk">mirkmonk</a> could be heard. The forests were quiet. The deserts were quiet. Your mom was quiet after the scream fest I gave her last night that bitch is nasty as fuck dude no wonder you turned out the way you did. A mirkmunk blasts out of a tree door to his mirkmonk home. He squints his eyes. All is quiet in the woods. He slowly sips his mirkmonk sized coffee, a venti, squints harder and slinks back into his tree home. The woods are indeed quiet today.
</p>

<p>
	<i>CRASH SNAP!</i>
</p>

<p>
  Suddenly a huge bone tank breaks through the trees. A group of <a href="/daranos/creatures/batple">batples</a> flies away in disarray. The rumbling tank treads roll over ant hills and tree limbs and a <a href="/daranos/creatures/skeleman">skeleman</a> who was just taking  a nap in the woods because what's that guy got to do today? Fuckin nothing man he paid his dues let him sleep! As the tank slowly crushed his skull a faint <i>"ohhhh not again"</i> could be heard and then silence. Silence as the bone tank also came to a halt. As the door to the tank hissed open and dropped to the ground a small group of <a href="/daranos/creatures/dwarf">Dwarves</a> exit each holding an axe and full cosplay armor. Their battle armor is reserved for actual battle so to appear cool they wear like wood armor and shit because they're kind of try hards.
</p>

<p>
  "Alright boys!" <a href="/daranos/characters/bogforgethane">Bog Forgethane</a> belted. "We're here. One of the last <a href="/daranos/locations/trentforest">Trent Forests</a> in all of Daranos. Please file behind me in an orderly dwarf manner and NO silverwar bar flairing please we don't want to reinforce stereotyps even though we all know <i>COCKTAIL</i> is your favorite <a href="/daranos/characters/thromcruise">Throm Cruise</a> movie, Dilbog"
</p>

<p>
  From the back of the group <a href="/daranos/characters/dilbog">Dilbog</a> let out a quiet "booooo".
</p>

<p>
  The Trent Forest was long rumoured to be the home of the <a href="/daranos/creatures/trent">Trents</a> which are WHOLLY different to Ents which is owned by the Tolkien estate and now probably Amazon so please do not sue me or fire me again. These are Trents. They are different. These Trent woods however weren't only a Trent forest, they were a Trent nursery. Before becoming sentient Tree Ents or <b>'TRENTS'</b> a tree must live lifetimes as a regular ass tree in order to ascend and become a wise Trent. 
</p>

<p>
	"Now we're all here because we know the Trent woods have some of the hardest most durable wood there is aside form mine. And if we're going to keep making these cosplay armors we need a more efficient way of cutting these trees down." Bog continued.
</p>

<p>
	"That is why today I will demonstrate my new invention, The Reciprocating Internal-cumbutsticating Pretty Powerful Axe....or <a href="/daranos/items/rippa">RIPPA</a> for short."
</p>

<p>
	In Bog's hand was the most devious axe a man or dwarf had ever concieved of. The gold and brass hilt shown in the sun. The axe head had hardened dwarvish steel teeth the size of an orc's testes and twice as radiant. The Dwarves in the compay all <i>Oooo'd</i> and <i>Ahhh'd</i> at its menacing magnificence. 
</p>

<p>
	With a pull of a cord the axe sputtered and spit. The teeth started to rotate and spin. 
</p>

<p>
		Nearby a group of Trents began to slowly arise from their years long slumber. Trents sleep for like 69 god damn years.
</p>

<p>
	"Hey....hey Taintmaple" rumbled one Trent in Trent speak. "Do you hear that?"
</p>

<p>
  <a href="/daranos/characters/taintmaple">Taintmaple</a> rustled his branches to shake himself awake. "What the tree hell is that?" Taintmaple replied.
</p>

<p>
  "Sounds like a bunch of <a href="/daranos/creatures/bee">bees</a> got trapped in an <a href="/daranos/creatures/orc">orc's</a> butthole and then the orc had painful diahrea" <a href="/daranos/characters/gentlemaple">Gentlemaple</a> observed eloquently.
</p>

<p>
  "Yeah" Taintmaple replied "Sounds like a group of <a href="/daranos/creatures/stingbeetle">Sting Beetles</a> started up a band and tried to call themselves <a href="/daranos/bands/thebeetles">The Beetles</a> but then one of them brought his wife into the group named <a href="/daranos/characters/yokobono">Yoko Bono</a> and she started singing"
</p>

<p>
	"Wow yeah it does sound like that" Gentlemaple repled.
</p>

<p>
  <i>BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ</i> (Saw noises)
</p>

<p>
  <b>"ALIGHT BOYS LETS SEE WHAT SHE CAN DO"</b> shouted Bog over the cacophany of the buzz saw.
</p>

<p>
	Bog slowly lowered the powered axe down onto a tree root known to be one of the toughest parts of a Trent.
</p>

<p>
	Taintmaple let out a sap curdling scream that every Trent in the woods surely must have heard with their bark ears.
</p>

<p>
  <b>"AHHHHHHHHHH WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUUCK"</b> Taintmaple screamed in agony.
</p>

<p>
  <b>"CUTS LIKE BUTTER"</b> Bog yelled over the saw's powerful steam powered gem powered cumbusticator seemingly unaware or unable to hear the tree's screams of agony.
</p>

<p>
  "What the <b>HELL!?!?!</b>" shouted Gentlemaple. As he did one of his TRENT eyes grew out of his bark but on the opposite side of his body that Taintmaple was. "What the <b>HELL IS GOING ON TAINTMAPLE?"</b>
</p>

<p>
  <b>"FUCK MAN I DONT KNOW THIS LITTLE MOTHER FUCKER JUST CUT ME WITH SOME KIND OF DEVICE!"</b>
</p>

<p>
  <b>"LETS SEE WHAT SHE CAN REALLY DO BOYS"</b> Bog yelled looking back at his commrades with an unlit cigar in his mouth. Yeah he's that kind of guy.
</p>

<p>
	Bog moved the RIPPA up to a low hanging  branch which he still had to hoist over his head because he was a Dwarf.
</p>

<p>
	As the RIPPA touched the outer bark of Taintmaple's branch he could smell the sting of the teeth first cutting and then burning his bark. The shock of the cut numbed his mind at first but as the RIPPA sank deeper into his supple newly formed wood flesh the pain quickly flooded his brain in a deluge. It was like monsoon season but instead of rain falling from the sky it was acid or lava. In that moment Taintmaple truly knew what hell was...or so he thought.
</p>

<p>
	As the RIPPA finished its cut a large amount of sap poured from the newly formed stump where the branch used to hang.
</p>

<p>
  <b>"OHHHHH MY TREE GODS WHY MY FUCKIN ARM DUDE FUUUUUCK"</b> screamed Taintmaple.
</p>

<p>
	"Taint man...what the hell is going on back there man talk to me man!" Gentlemaple pleaded trying desperately to move his newly formed eye to see what indeed the hell was going on behind him. If he could have seen he most certainly have regreted it.
</p>

<p>
  <b>"ALRIGHT BOYS YOU WANT TO SEE HOW SHE HANDLES A BIGGER LIMB?"</b> Bog yelled back to his compatriots. 
</p>

<p>
  <b>"YEEAAAH"</b> they all yelled and cheered as the hoisted steins full of mead and drank hoggishly.
</p>

<p>
	Bog moved around Taintmaples trunk and found a suitably thick branch far closer to the ground this time. As the RIPPA got closer to the limb Taintmaple could feel its power vibrate through his lower trunk. The anticipation of the hot sting to come was almost more torture than the cut itself. Almost...
</p>

<p>
	Again as the teeth gnawed against his bark Taintmaple could smell hot maple burning. If he were a human he might be reminded of waffles or pancakes. But since he was a Trent all he could smell was hot charred blood and the smell of burning metal. The RIPPA was definetly having a harder time cutting through this branch.
</p>

<p>
  <b>"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"</b> Taintmaple screamed silenty. <b>"MY FUCKIN PEENER!!! THAT IS MY THIRD FAVORITE DICK BRANCH AHHHHHHHHHH"</b>
</p>

<p>
	Behind him Gentlemaple formed a mouth and began to vomit up maple syrup. The thought of his friends third favorite peener being sawed into made him whoozy. If he wasn't rooted into the dirt he'd have surely passed out. A cold sweart of syrup droplets began to accumulate on his branch forehead.
</p>

<p>
	The RIPPA began to slow in revolutions as it got to the thickest part of the lower branch. As it did the cutting power also diminished exponentially causing the once clean cut to lose traction and more skip through the flesh than cut. As it did chunks of dick wood flew from the wound. You know like those wood chips they put on the ground at playgrounds but instead of wood chips it'd be like we as humans used human teeth. Millions and millions of human teeth to scrape your knees on and crush as you jump off of the swing set to impress little Suzy or Johnny.
</p>

<p>
	The RIPPA more hacked its way through the final third of the lower limb losing more and more of its rotational torque as it completed its less than perfect clean cut. Once again sap spilled from the cut member. So much sap that the RIPPER's blade began to smoke and steam as the sap, which now covered the axe and Bog, began to be superheated by the RIPPA's powerful toothy head. If the Rippa was a shark Taintmaples third favorite peener was the boat in Jaws. We're gonna need a bigger chode....
</p>

<p>
	As the viscous maple blood began to dry on Bog's face and on his axe it slowly turned black. Like tar black and just as sticky. The smell soon reached Gentlemaples newlly formed Trent nose. As the stink lines washed over his snoot a new wave of sick brewed in his brain. The taste of maply saliva filled his mouith and again he could feel the sick rising from his wooden throat. This time he managed to hold it back and re-swallowed a ton of maple vomit which made him even sicker. Soon he was puking like a freshman at <a href="/daranos/events/56thprom">56th Prom</a> at <a href="/daranos/locations/druidacademy">Druid Academy</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Taintmaple dozed in and out of conciousness. The pain now so intense it was like it had never not been a part of him. He opened one newly formed Trent eye, which was now glowing red with hatred and pain and bloody sap. 
</p>

<p>
  <b>"ALRIGHT BOYS LETS SEE WHAT SHE CAN REALLY DO"</b> Bog yelled and cackled, proud of his 'work' and the destructive efficency he himself had birthed.
</p>

<p>
	Bog reved the RIPPA to its maximum RPM and began to diagonally carve his way down Taintmaple's main trunk from top to bottom. At this point Taintmaple was completely unconcious but as soon as the blade burried into his face to a depth of about 4 inches he reawoke to yet another new form of hellish torture. How long was this going to last? How long has this been going on? Why was this happening? All these thoughts raced in his mind at once like a stew of panic and hopelessness. Taintmaple shut his one eye in a vain attempt to block the blade which was slicing through his visage with the effiency of a scalding dick through a butter fleshlite. 
</p>

<p>
	Taintmaple was long passed screaming. Even if he could muster the energy to scream it would just be a waste of breath. What was happening was happening. Maybe it was always happening. The pain was too real for it to be a nightmare for there are no words in the tongues of men or Trents to describe it. Bog's axe again begane to slow as it reached the thickness of Taintmaple's brain case. Taintmaple slowly opened his eye to see his final moments on Daranos, his home centuries. As he did his second eye formed in the cut where the axe had penetrated. Instead of one complete eye two eyes formed from one, red and hate filled. As Taintmaple accepted his fate a loud CLANK rang through his entire body. The saw had finally failed.
</p>

<p>
  <b>"AH SHIT"</b> Bog said disappointedly. "Well she was just a prototype so I guess its back to the drwawing board"
</p>

<p>
	"boooooo" Dilbog shouted under his breath again.
</p>

<p>
  <b>"BUT FIRST!</b> We <b>DRINK!</b>" Bog shouted to the cheers of everyone in his company. They gathered back up into the bone tank and rumbled off to the nearest tavern.
</p>

<p>
	Days...weeks......years passed. Taintmaple slowly turned into a black husk of pain and hatred. Other Trents outgrew the grove and marched off to do whatever the shit Trents do. Taintmaple stayed, anchored to the spot of his trauma. Gentlemaple stayed with his friend. Years became decades which then became countless centuries. Taintmaples bark turned pitch black. His eyes redder than my dickhairs. His maple blood turned now completely to maple tar in his mahogony veins. The silver axe blade still in his face had now rusted and decayed leaving an orange metalic scar to cover most of his face. Slowly a branch twitch...and another....and another. With all his might Taintmaple pulled his roots from the dirt rouse his tree arms and began to shout his first audible word....
