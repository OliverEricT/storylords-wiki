	EP 14

R1-C1-1

	The world is old. I can feel it in my back. I can feel it in my scrote. I can smell it in that old man ear smell that you get when you don't take a shower for like 3 days which is totally fuckin nasty take a shower you dirty ass bitch ass bitch. Daranos is ancient and so are the dwraves who plunder her caverns deeply and greedily. Hungrily even like they were plundering all night long and so deep that the cavern will have to make up a saying that they put on t-shirts that says like 'Once you go Dwarf you'll be wet as a wharf' or something I dont know we'll workshop it. Plundering and lootin so hard and long just like I plundered your sweet mama's back cave last so if you heard a lot of noise and squelching sounds that was what it was now go do your homework because no step son of mine isn't making honor roll.

Then the camera pans up over the lush forests of Daranos and we helicopter over the mountains as the title screen comes up that says "DARANOS: A Very Special Prequel" and then dwarf language appears at the bottom of hte screen only to morph into english that says "-6969 BF (before firing)" The First Age.

CLINK CLILNK CLINK. The sound of a pick axe rings against an ancient stone. The manly as hell hands holding it are drenched in manly sweat. The hands are rough and dirty like maybe this guy could start a match with his hands like they do in the cartoons?

"Ehhhh F'fej" yelled the dwarf up from a long shaft longer than the shaft that gave your mom an ameteur colonoscopy last night if ya know what I mean. " Throw me down another Ale Bomb brother" Vek Strongbong said wiping the hot manly grease from his brow as the candle from his adorable head lantern show off his goggles and made a twinkle sound.

"ONE ALE BOMB COMING UP" F'fej yelled down and then tossed a wooden ball with a makeshift fuse attached to it along with a rudimentary mechanical box powered by a gem within was trapped the soul of a Pissing Welp. Nasty things those Pissers.

"If I may sir", interuped R1-C1-1 or 'RICH' for short. "I don't believe drinking on the job is safe nor productive in our endeavors here" He said in an adorable british accent. "My calculations state that the integrity of these rocks, though ancient, may be unsuitable for the weight of even a dwarf such as you and your brother." Rich finished.

"OI ROBIT. QUIET UR TITS" F'fej said as down below Vek grabbed the device and cracked it open. Inside the ale was frothy and deliciois and cold. The Strongbongs had invented the devise not as an explosive but a self sustaining cold ale recepticle that shook the ale just enough to give them an advantage in the ancient dwarven tradition of the "Belch Contest". Vek finished the ale in a single gulp and let out the manliest belch ever heard in the land. The shockwave of the burp erupted upward out of the shaft as birds flew for cover from the dead trees all around the mountain. 1000 miles away a Mirkmonk sat on his porch enjoying his evening pipe when the shockwave hit. His eyes exploded from the initial shock of the sound wave traveling at over 200 miles per hour. The  whiskers on his cutie face were singed and then completely burnt off as his flesh melted from the combination of stench and shear force of the gutteral discharge. 

"FOOKIN KIDS" his skeleton said as his bones crumbled into dust. He did  not survive. 

Rich and F'fej stood atop the shaft opening bracing for something to happen. Vek in the shaft gently moved his feet to see if the ground below him was stable.

"See Rich" F'fej said. "Nothing to worry about my boy" he continued as he pat Rich on his little robot head. Rich's monoball tread moved closer to the hole as he looked down.

"OI that was a good one" Vek shouted upward. But just as he finished the ground began to rumble and rocks started pouring down on him like rain drops from hell.

"AHHH FUCK ME" Vek said.

"VEK" F'fej shhouted down as he and Rich were now themselves struggling for purchase on what was now surely a death trap. The mountain groaned and shook like it was taking a whicked hangover piss and had to get all the piss out of its peener but standing at the toilet was just too much for him this morning. Suddenly the entirety of the ground gave way as the  Ffej, VEk and Rich plummeted into the dark below. As they hit the ground the last thought goinog throu Vek's mind was "I hope I don't land on my dick" and then THUD. All went black.

Now I know what you're thinking. "Hey Daranos Narrator, weren't these characters introduced on the critically aclaimed and hit podcast Original Original Characters hosted by our own beloved Jeff Pennington and Kevin Cole?" Well you would be correct. But you may also be thinking "Hey Daranos Narrator who definitely isn't Josh and who's opinions are wholy their own, weren't they named something different in that episode?" You would also be correct about that but that podcast is over 2 hours long and I'll be damned if I remember their names let alone when I started talking about them. So we'll just retcon the fuck out of this one and say that that episode was a part of our "legends" collection or something equally insulting that way everyone on the internet can argue about how their names were better in the legends lore giving us free advertising. Divisiveness is so hot right now even though its exhausting and like watching 2 toddlers fight over the last baby pullup diaper for their poopy dirty baby buttts.

"ARRRRGH MY DICK" Vek yelled as conciounsess returned. Rich sped his monoball turret around and righted himself as he dusted off his little joints with a metalic hand.

"BLAAAARGH" F'fej yelled. 

"Is anything  broken brother?" Vek asked

"Just my pride" F'fej said as he blew dust from his beard. All around they could only see darkness. As they looked up they could no longer see the hole in which they fell through. Rocks continued to fall and clatter to the ground as the group slowly recovered and gained their footing.

"Where are we?" Vek asked Rich.

"I do believe we have fallen into a shaft created by your gastrointestinal outburst" Rich said.

"Well no shit dingus" Vek snapped. "But what is this cavern? Are we close to " but just as he was finishing F'fej shushed him.

"SHoosh. Do you hear that?" They stood still in the  darkness as the silence became defeaning.

"Nooo?" Vek said as he grabbed the handle of his maul from his back.

"Listen....." Ffej held his hand up in front of him almost like  he was bracing for the sound to hit him again.

"help....help me...." they all heard faintly from the cavern ahead of them.

"Welp...this has beeen really fun and all but I think  its time we skidaddled  back to Kaz Adooodle for some chippy bois" Vek said as he turned.

"help...help...." said the voice of a woman. Maybe a young girl. It sounded quiet but desperate.

Rich then turned on his light eyes and lit the cavern up with a red yet dull hue. All around them were millions of tons of rock but in front of them lay a single opening in the cavern which was about as tall as a Daranosian Yeti when fully erect and yes I DO mean that kind of erect.

"We have to help her" Ffej said looking back at his brother. Vek unslung his maul which was of ancient dwarven make but at this time they just called it dwarven make because to them now is  now and not that time I said earlier on the screen I mean in your imagination yeah thats the ticket. The hammer of the maul was covered in the spikes of the fabled FireDiplodoucus of Fiploduke. The spines were said to be stronger than any steel and could cleave even yo mama's chastity belt intwain.

"Fine" Vek relented. "But we're not here for that remember. We have to keep focused."

Ffej unsheathed his large bastard sword and held it up. As they passed through the cavern entrance the warm air of the inner mountain hit their faces. Rich's bot eyes quickly became as useless as 7 fireplaces in a single home as the darkness gave way to a giant room with just one long stone bridge connecting to another opening on the other side which was like a mile away. Rich's bot eyes looked down and the red was quickly soaked up by a new pit of darkness and had he been cabable of it, the fear of heights that would make any man or automobot piss their pampers like a cry baby bitch at the fair. 'It's ok I'll hold your purses I dont mind' youd say as piss trickled  down your pantaloons.

"Whoa" Vek said as the smell of dust and old damp minerals hit his hairy nostrels.

"help...help me" the voice said again in the same almost monotone desperation as before.

"HELLO!?" Vek yelled across the void. His voice echoed off of chamber walls that hadn't felt vibrating air since the age of Darren.

"Hello?" the dainty female voice returned.

"WHERE ARE YOU?" F'fej shouted again his voice echoing to nothing in the darkness.

"Where are you?" The small voice said again with a giggle.

"uhhhh" Vek said gripping his maul tighter.

"WE'RE COMING TO GET YOU" F'fej shouted back into the darkness but as he did he noticed no echo this time. Just silence.

"WE ARE THE ONES COMING TO GET YOU MUAH HAHAHAHHA" Laughed entirely new and scary voice that probably wasn't from a little girl but how knows. As it finished the darkness below them began to swell and convulse like a living black ink shot out of some kind of evil squids ink hole. The black rose and roiled over the bridge towering above the trio as it crashed down behind them breakin the bridge off from the entrance they had wandered through moments ago.

"RUN!" Rich shouted as he did a cute little skid burn out with his monotread and hauled monoass toward the opposide side of the bridge.

The vicious apendages of the blackness billowed upward and flexed before one after another they crashed down destroying the ancient stone bridge behind them. As we all know Dwarves are naturaly sprinters who are wasted on cross country so the brothers along with their  robot companion scooted across the bridge beating out the destruction of whatever the hell that thing was. As they reached the other side they slid under an unsealed door and turned aroundon their stomachs to see only darkness through the  slit of the door. The bridge no longer there but nor was the destruction they had just witnessed.

"What the fuck is this place?" F'fej asked aloud.

"We have to be on the right track" Vek said with a new sense of excitement either from the heart pounding action scene with the BBC (Big Black Cavestroyer) or from picking up the trail they had set out to find so long ago.

They trio wanded until they came across another opening in the ground. Below they could hear pounding.

"Drums?" Vek asked the others almost confirming that he himself wasn't crazy.

"Drums." Ffej said. "Drums in the deep..."

As they roped down into an entirely new gigantic cavern the air became hot and musty. The smell of burning oil and natural gas shot up their hairy ass dwarf nostrils. The darkness gave way to an orange light. As the heat intensified so did the glow. They could hear pounding and screaming. Clanging of metal and thudding of drums. The sound of bones hitting skins. The sound of screams so ear piercing it made the blood in the brothers' ears run hot and pound inside their heads.

As they repelled down and broke into a new cavern they could see a sea of writhing goblin flesh. Goblins playing drums. Goblins wailing on guitars. Goblins wailing on double guitars and triple basses and drum sets that were ALL bass drums. Goblins howled and head banged to the fuckin sick licks and pure metalic rage coming out of their instruments. The brothers watched mouths agape as the goblins surged forward as one and the biggest mosh pit ever seen exploded into a full roar. Goblins were pickin up change while others flailed their arms around punching anyone and anything in range.

"uuuuuuuhhhhhh" Vek said looking at his brother.

Suddenly a record needle scratch sounded as everything went quiet and all goblins froze mid freak out.

"Hi" F'fej said waving his free hand as he spun around on his rope dangling above the goblins.

"Sup" said the Goblin King sitting at a 347 piece drum set as  he held 2 guitars in his 4 other hands. "So uh....you guys here for the rehearsal?" the King asked politely.

"Uh no we're uh...." Vek trailed off.

"Jerry you IDIOT" The King cut him off. "We HAVE to get this right or we'll never win the talent show. I could hear your out of tune b string from all the way over in Cumswind you fucking idiot! Tune it up or get out!" The king yelled as Jerry only sat there crying trying to tune his guitar. Fuckin Jerry.

"Look" the King brought his attention back to the 3 weird dwarves hanging from  his cieling. "We don't mind if you watch but it's gonna be hard to pass through this area of the cavern because well, as you can see, there's like a thousand of us."


"Yeah I mean..." Rich began to query. "Why do you guys have so many people in your band?"


"We were going for like a polyphonic spree vibe mixed with a Slipknot vibe" The King began to explain with a sigh. "I mean, as you can see, we wouldn't even need scary masks since we're all ugly as all fuck". As he finished all eyes shot over to Jerry who was decidely the ugliest of the Goblins because he had like tumors and growths that looked like dicks on his head. He called the dreads but they were head dicks. He began to sob uncontrolably as he felt the eyes of thousands of his friends looking at  his head dicks.

"So do what ya gotta do to get through" the King went on. "Honestly I dont even care if you kill some of us because we dont' need 798 guitarists."

"Coooool" Ffej said as he and his brothers feet hit the dirt below.

"ALRIGHT BOYS 1 2 3 GO" The King double bassed so hard the dwarves could feel it in their thick hairy sturdy man chests.

All around them the band began to play and push the trio around like they were at Ozfest 99 and Crazy Town had just left the stage so everyone was super  horny for some real metal. 

"BROTHER" Shouted Vek as he disapeared into the maw. RICH scurried up Ffej's arm and took position on his rucksack using his gllow eyes to find Vek.

"FUCK THIS" Ffej said as he drew his bastard sword and began to hack down anything under 5 feet tall. Blood and viscera of the carnage flew into his face as he almost felt pleasure killing this sorry excuse for a multimilellial piece band. As he gored  his way through the crowd the devastation left in his wake seemed to only fuel the goblins metal lust. They cranked out solos and riffs so wicked nobody would see the likes of them again until Wife Bones would h it the scene several ages from now.

The King pounded beats so impossible that when an underling got too close to his octuple bass drums his head instantly exlpoded and made the sound of a party popper. Vek lay on the ground getting bum rushed by the pit. As he grabbed for his maul time seemed to slow down as the breakdown of the goblin song began to slow. Vek thrust his maul into the noses of a Goblin who was laughing so hard spit was flying from his nose and mouth. As Vek landed the devastating blow to his now broken nose the beat kicked back in and all fuck broke loose. He swung at everything that wasn't him until he reached the side stage where he saw Ffej and Ricch waiting for him. 

"That was intense" Vek said wiping bits of goblin off himself. As they exited into another tunnel they heard the Golbin King speak as the song stopped.

"Ok guys that was a really good rendition of our National Anthem entitled 'Hatred Will Prevail (Blood 4 Blood). Now lets move on and we can practice our song for the talent show"

After what seemed like hours the brothers finally reached a stone door.

"This has to be it" Vek said as he ran his rough sexy man hands over the  stone like I wished he would do with my hard rock if you know what I mean.

"Could this be it?" Rich went up and ran his robot hand over the  stone mimicing his dwarven friend. "The lost city of Vulgar Maldur". As he uttered the words the stone began to creek and open as smoothlly as I opened yo mama's ass last night. I put my peener in her butt yall is what I'm getting at.

Inside a blinding golden light scorched through the dust and made the 2 dwarves blink as tears rolled down their faces. They both put on their goggles and stepped into the light. As their eyes adjusted they could see a single pillar of light which within held a shield with a glowing red jewel at the center.

"There she is..." Vek said in awe.

"I dont recall the legend saying anything about a shield" F'fej said suspsiciously.

"I do not believe that is a shield" Rich said correcting him. "That appears to be a breastplate. But to what I do not have that information at this time."

As they rounded the dias that held the hovering artifacts they could see arm sockets and tubes and gears of various sorts inside the breastplate as if someone or something was being built.

"Why leave this  here?" Vek asked himself as  he began to approach the  hovering artifacts.

"I do not beleive that touching that is a wise decision" Rich interupted.

"Help me..." the dainty female voice again spoke this time BOOMING throughout the room. The brothers covered their ears as the gem at the center of the breastplate now pulsed in time with the spoken words.

"Help. MEEEEEEE" The voice screeched as it became so loud and shrill that all sense of reality was burned from the minds of the two adventurers. Just as suddenly as it began the sound stopped. Silence.

"Help me...." the dainty girls voice was now back again trembling with fear.

"Help me grab the gem, F'fej" Vek said as he began to climb up on the dias.

"Wait...brother look" Ffej said as he pointed up to the structure above. Above them a solid gold dome had been constructed. 

"That is a solid gold shield of some sort" Rich said "I believe this room is some sort of fail safe or containment unit for whatever they were building"


"A weapon?" Ffej asked.

"Possibly. I do not have sufficent data to asnwer that request."

Vek still slowly moved up the dias holding out a hand for Ffej to grab. 

"Come brother we have searched for DECADES for this gem. Help me get it out so we can both share the glory!"

"This is a fucking stupid idea" Ffej said but Vek looked his brother in the eye and that same glimmer glinted off his goggles as he smiled that pure micheivious smile like he just hit a nat 20 on charisma. 

"Fine" F'fej relented. "But this is a bad idea. Worse than the time we invented that mechanical fleshlite that you said was safe."


"Yeah well...we made a fortune on those at the torture auction by selling them as peener rippers" Vek corrected.

As the brother's approached the jewel it glinted off the golden light spewing from all around them like hot piss on a cold winters morning.

"Help......meeeee" the girls voice rang through the chamber as both brothers reached for the gem. "HELP.....M" the voice boomed and suddenly, as they both touched its surface, the voice stopped.

The room turned blood red and the hissing of ancient pistons and machines wirred to life. The dome above creaked and rattled as it shook a thousand lifetimes of disuse off of its bearings. The brothers looked up in awe not quite realizing that this indeed was probably "a fucking bad idea".

"I believe the dome is closing around the curaise" Rich said obviously. But as the two brothers tried to move the internal wirings and hoses grabbed at their feet and tugged them backwards causing Vek to hit his chin on the metal below him, his teeth flying out of his mouth along with blood. 

"Oh shiiiiiiiiiiit" Ffej said as he was being enveloped by rubberized hoses and copper.

RICH scootered over to a control panel and began pressing buttons.

"There should be a release here" He said about as frantically as a mindless british...I mean robot could sound.

"I dont think they built this thing to keep it safe." Ffej said grunting against the strain of wires. "I think they build it to keep THEMSELVES safe"

As the dome lowered Vek could see his blood drip slowly down into the inner workings of the machine that was now strangling every muscle in their bodies. Drip....drip........DRIP. When the final droplet hit the structure below the entire room filled with the sound of alarms and klaxons and not the cool ones from rap songs. The scary ones from nuclear war movies. All at once the dome collapsed down sealing the two brothers inside. Little port round port holes made with some kind of strong solid clear glass were their only view to the outisde. Rich scooted over to the porthole closest to his friends.

"I can not open it" He said sadly as he pressed his little metalic hand against the not glass.

Ffej struggled but managed to free his left arm as he grabbed at the wires holding his brother down.

"NO" Vek said. "Get in the breastplate....the....gem...its powerful magic....can protect.....us" Vek was not choking on his words as the air was being drawn out of his lungs. Ffej grabbed for the plate chest and used all the strength he had left to rootch himself inside. Once inside the wires all around him let go. 

"I'm in brother. I'M COMING FOR YOU" He yelled as he stuck  his head out of the top. But when he looked down he saw Vek was being devoured by the wires like he was a rat in a pit of snakes.

"NO" Ffej shouted as he concentrated on what little magic he knew to try and awaken the sleeping gem. As he did he felt a tickle up his forearm. And then another on his back shoulder blade. Then more up his spinal column until PRICK. SNAP. The wires in the breastplate began to sink into his flesh. But not just his flesh  his bones too. They cracked and splintered inside of ohis body causing an agony he had never even dreamed was possible. At the same time the wires holding Vek seemed to regurgitate him back to the surface. He  gasped for air as he broke out of the writing mechanical morass.

"Ffej....help me" he said but it was too late. Ffej was now bleeding from almost every orifice of his body. Blood stained the gem and the chest plate and his face. And thats when it got really horrible. 

Suddenly the mechanical snakes lifted Vek toward his brother and began to bite into him and sink their mechanisms into his musclulature and skeletal structure. He cried in pain as he too felt his bone snapping like twigs inside of hismelf.

On the outside of the dome RICH could only watch as his two squishy meat friends were being ripped apart from the inside. Though he was saved from the  horrors of their screams from the domes protective windows it was almost worse watching them in silent agony pound on the not glass desperate for a miracle to break the glass or ANYTHING to  releive their pain. RICH put his hand on the window and held it there as Veks hand was snatched away by a wire leaving only a bloody hand print. The dome itself filled with blood. The blood of thousands. RICH watched in morbid fascination at the amount of blood. Who did it belong to? Did they store it? How did they keep it from rotting? His robotic brain thinking of a million questions in some sort of robot version of shock having just watched his friends liquify in front of him, their various pastes and matters mashed together like play dough.

Realizing it was too late RICH hauled monotread toward a nearby hatch. Using  his fire appendage he lit the gate melting it from the wall and scooted in just as the entire room behind him began to steam and creak. The dome wasn't enough to hold whatever was inside of it, either by poor design or age and disuse. The last thing RICH recorded on his crystaline brain was the room and tunnel he was in collapsing.

For hundreds of years he lay there. Sometimes he'd log on and see if anything had moved him. There was always a chance erosion or some other unlucky treasure seeker would find this place and dig him out. He could warn them! Maybe he could even find his friends....or what was left of othem. He logged off.

He did this over and over for years. Millennia maybe. He didn't know. There was no way to know. As time ticked by his power began to fade. He'd log on less and less for less and less amount of time to still see pitch blackness. This was his tomb. With the last of his power he logged off one last time....

Drip...........drip.........dripdripdrip. Red liquid pinged against his outer chasis as it slowly drpped through the tiniest of cracks in the wall above him. RICH didn't have the power to log back on and probably didn't know it was even happening. The dripping stopped after only a few seconds which in contrast to the eternity he had spent down in this rubble was like a nano second. The most interesting thing to oh appen to him in millenia and it was over in seconds. Like virgin on prom night.

Suddenly the rocks moved.....above ground an earthquak or some kind of shifting of sediment rattled the mountain that had once slept peacefully for as long as anyone could remember. Thats when a single metalic hand reached up out of hte dirt dragging its broken body behind it. As its one remaning eye peaked out of fhte dirt it glowed blood red as copper wiring and tubing hissed behinid it like a medusa. 

THE END
