<p>
	Boris Bloodsuck, formerly known as Vampire Lord, sat at the bar face down singing and humming his favorite shitcom song as Fred whiped up the bar. Fred, with a single finger, lifted up Boris' head and swiftly whiped the drool and god knows what else from under Boris and let his head slam back down onto the hard surface. Boris hardly noticed.
</p>
<p>
	"Alright Vampire Lord" Fred said sarcastically. "You don't have to go home but please don't ever come back here ever again for the love of the gods you are so annoying and are a bad singer and you smell like how a rusty spoon tastes."
</p>
<p>
	"ONE MORE BLOOD COCKTAIL MY GOOD SIR" Boris shouted as he slid off his stool.
</p>
<p>
	"I told you before we don't serve that here." Fred said as he turned around to an empty stool.
</p>
<p>
	"Then what have I been getting white girl wizard wasted on this whole time" Boris said as a single hand popped up from below the counter waving an empty cocktail glass.
</p>
<p>
	"Girly Temples" Fred said matter of factly.
</p>
<p>
	Just then Graals bell tower began to ring as the morning Hell Cock began to crow.
</p>
<p>
	"SKEEEREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELKSOIDFOISJDFOISDJOSIDJFOIJOIJEOIJSKSJJJHELLNOISES GARGLES"
</p>
<p>
	"Look buddy" Fred said. "I appreciate that times are hard right now and you don't have a clan? Are you guys called clans? If so you should probably rebrand that its got a bad connotation. But you can't stay here all night every night just. This isn't an Inn. Why don't you...I dont know hit up a library to sleep in like most homeless vampires do?"
</p>
<p>
	Thats it. Thanks for the show today guys. We did it. Got both prompts in on the first page. Editor Josh queue the music. I'd like to thank Weezer for being the musical guest tonight! As always thanks to Rich for hosting his 29th episode in a row. We got a regular Christopher Walken on our hands here. Stay tuned for 4 straight hours of Girls Gone Wild infomercials!
</p>
<p>
	"But...but..." Boris pleaded. "It's the dawn! I can't go out there the sun will kill me!"
</p>
<p>
	"I saw you on the roof the other day rubbing Peppercorn's JO lotion all over yoruself sun tanning dude! You're a daywalker. We all know it. NOW GIT" Fred said as he picked up a broom and started sweeping the Vampire Lord out the door.
</p>
<p>
	"FINE FINE. I go" Boris relented. "But only cause I wants to and not because mean man with adamantite abs and soft supple rag whiping hands wants Boris to. Good day to you SIR". With that Boris waved his hands and drew a tunnel on the wall and stepped through it as is classic vampire lore and  a real power they have don't look it up.
</p>
<p>
	Immediately Boris was transported back to his favorite spot to sleep and hunt rats for their blood and milk. The back alley of the Flamingos Hide Out.
</p>
<p>
	Boris made a record scratching noise with his mouth and started to narrate in the third person.
</p>
<p>
	"So's. I bet you all wondering how Boris got into this situation. It all began in episode 27 where I was a bit character and mainly comic relief for a boring story that was headed no where. All alone in this world Boris can't even find thralls to narrate story of his life. A pointless tale much like episode 27. Nobody will ever remember Boris or his amazing singing voice...." 
</p>
<p>
	Boris sat down next to a rat. The rat looked up cutely at Boris as it chewed on a piece of cheese.
</p>
<p>
	"Ah Mr. Rat...you got any milks for Boris?" 
</p>
<p>
	"GIVE ME ALL YOUR FUCKIN MONEY PUNK" The rat yelled as he pulled out a gun? What the hell?
</p>
<p>
	Boris woke up in the same ally around dusk. His head hurt from being pistol whipped by the most gangster ass thug ass hard as nails ass mother fuckin rodent in all of Big D. And that's saying something because I have literally seen a rat eat its own foot off just because it was bored and in a cage for too long. Rats don't fuck around. Rats will eat you from the inside out and then make a little house of your rib cage where they'll just breed with each other Alabama style until all your skin has been devoured and there aren't any more nutriets to sustain their Borg-esque rat pool they've formed into a moving wave of disease and death. Like the floor is actually moving like those things in airports but its rats.
</p>
<p>
	"Boooooorrrrriiiiissssss" a gentle whisper blew threw the wind. "Booooorrrrrrriiiiiiiiiissssss"
</p>
<p>
	"HUH!" Boris jerked upright like I jerked your dad upright last night. Yeah that's wasn't him in the garage jackin the car up taht was me jackin his dad handle. We're going to a ball game next weekend. The Padres vs The Padre Fuckers you're not invited.
</p>
<p>
	"Natasha!" Boris shouted reflexively.
</p>
<p>
	"Boooorrriiiiiisssss. Come to the Libary" the voice said.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm sorry...did you just say 'libary'?" Boris said witha  wince
</p>
<p>
	"The libary Boris....set me free....I will make your dreams come true"
</p>
<p>
	"I mean that sounds great but I need to know. Are you saying Libary on purpose or are you like doing a bit here? This could be a deal breaker. I dont know if I can have my dreams fullfilled by a dissembodied voice that can't even say LIBRARY. I'm a Russo Vampiric Stereotype and even I learned how to say LIBRARY with two R's. Is not hard. LIBRARRRY"
</p>
<p>
	The voice fell silent and only the pounding of Boris' aching jaw and head could be heard in the still of the night.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh ok I guess we're done. Not gonna answer me I guess. Cool. Good talk lady. Guess I'm going to the LIBARY"
</p>
<p>
	As Boris reached the massive building that once housed the library he glanced upward to see the ancient script written in the stone blocks of the building. Like a temple that was once revered the writing had stood for a thousand years only now one of the R's was blown apart and not visible.
</p>
<p>
	"Graal Libary" Boris said outloud. "Well I'll be damned."
</p>
<p>
	Boris walked into what once was a gigantic and grand repository of knowledge but was now only mainily used as a toilet. One which he himself had used many times. He had been here before of course back when he was a young vampire. He'd study the ancient ways. Deep in the stacks he'd practice sucking blood out of the necks of his victims on a pillow cushion. Don't shame him. We've all been there am I right guys? Editor edit out those cricket sounds pls.
</p>
<p>
	Now all that remained of this once majestic knowledge factory were ruins and dusty tomes thrown to the ground. The Paladins had let the library decay and rot under their rule since reading books was quote "for soyboys with nerd boners". After the revolt in Graal many looters took most of the tomes. Especially the erotic ones that were kept behind those weird library cage things? Like you know the ones. Those like medieval jail doors they have around books that only make you want to know what the hell is in that section even more. Instead of just having them accessible to everyone and being adults about human sexuality or pictures of tits or boners or that the holocaust actually did happen or whatever controversial thing people think in this god forsaken hellscape of a joke of existence......ANYWAY.
</p>
<p>
	"Hello!?" Boris shouted into the darkness. The echo of his voice traveled far down into a cavernous well of book stacks below. The Graal Libary was once so caked up with knowledge that the ancient city fathers built the temple into the ground. A swirling double helix of stacks and stairs slowly twisted and arched downward until not even Boris super vampire night vision could see the bottom.
</p>
<p>
	He walked slowly down one of the spiralling ramps and randomly plucked a dusty book from a shelf.
</p>
<p>
	"My Top 10 Favorite Defenistrations by Aldus Mudspine" He said aloud. "Pass" Boris said as he threw the book down the into the pit. He waited for the sound of the heavy leather bound tome to reverberate back up to him but....nothing.
</p>
<p>
	"Wheeeeeew" he whistled. "That's a big hole. Just like yo mama's hole hehe" He laughed at himself "Man I really need to get some friends"
</p>
<p>
	He picked up another book. This time a heavier gold bound tome with lots of pretty pictures on the cover. "M.I.L.F. by Reeses T Wize" he said aloud.
</p>
<p>
	Under the title in parenthesis "Mummies I'd Like to Find". It was just a list of mummies that this guy apparently would like to find and have dinner with? "Pass" Boris again said throwing the book down.
</p>
<p>
	"USE the caaaaaaaaaaaaaandle" the female voice was back. "The candle in the libarrrrrry" it said spooky as all heck.
</p>
<p>
	"What candle what are you even saying to me WOMAN SPEAK WHAT TRANSLATES TO ENGLISH FOR OUR AUDIENCE FOR FUCK SAKE"
</p>
<p>
	A green glow could be seen from below in the pit faintly on one of the ramps leading down into the pit. Boris squinted and could barely make out its shine. Even in pitch blackness the glow was dull and the distance was great.
</p>
<p>
	"UGH now I have to go down this stupid ramp for a candle. These stupid ghosts and their riddles and fetch quests. Gather 5 Flesh Tulips. Find my lost prized champion Mirkmunk bone car drivers. Bring me a dime back of giggle dirt. Drink a whole gallon of rats milk without puking...." he went on and on as he decended into the inky blackness. It was as if the pages of every single tome spilled their words out into the void and covered the whole area in shadow. 
</p>
<p>
	Boris slowly made his way down and down into that shadow. He'd be out of breath if he had lungs that still needed air. As he reached the green light he could see a floor full of candles. Most were unlit save one which glowed an erie green. 
</p>
<p>
	"Ok ghost now what" he said looking up in several directions.
</p>
<p>
	"Use the caaaaaaaaaaandle" the voice said again.
</p>
<p>
	"Are....are you trying to say KINDLE?" Boris asked.
</p>
<p>
	"Caaaaaaaaaaaaaaandle....C.A.N.D.L.E. Caaaaandle" the voice repeated passive aggressive as fuck. "Put a book above the CAAAAAAAAAAANDLE"
</p>
<p>
	Boris looked around the ground for a book. Under a pile of broken shelves he found a random tome. He blew the dust off of its cover and flipped it over trying to find a title.
</p>
<p>
	"G.I.L.F.s by Reeses T Wize. Boy this guy sure had a genre." Under the tittle again in parentheses was written "Gelatanous Cubes I'd Like to Fuck". Boris shrugged and brought the book over to the lit green candle. He held the book above the flame until he felt a pull. Almost like a magnet locking another magnet onto itself the book stayed horizontal just above the candles flame. After a second the green flame engulfed the book and vaporized it within millilsecond. Stunned Boris looked around like "WTF was that shit" but soon he could see green text being printed in mid air above the candle. 
</p>
<p>
	"OHHHHH CANDLE! I get it" he said realizing this lame jokes payoff wasn't even that good but here we are!
</p>
<p>
	He read a few lines....
</p>
<p>
	"One Cube in particular seems really fuckable" the text read. "The milky white geletane of this cube is caused by all the jizz it consumes because of its fuckability"
</p>
<p>
	"What the hell is this shit" Boris said. But he couldn't help it. Almost against his will he kept reading. His eyes grew heavy as the words he read spilled into him like jizz into a white geletanous cubes flesh orafice. He felt himself swaying back and forth and tried to close his eyes. It didin't matter. The images flooded his brain until ZOOOOOP.
</p>
<p>
	He woke up in a dungeon. He tried to look around but saw with new eyes. He was a geletanous cube himself.
</p>
<p>
	"WHAT THE ACTUAL FUUUUUUCK" He said but the words only came out as glorps and slorps and bubbles of spittle. Suddenly he noticed a female cube who's acid spittle smelled like rotting flesh. He was turned on. Boris would go on to live a full life with his cube wife. They'd have twins. Glorpinox and Splork. Splork would go on to become a cube senator and represent Delve District 349 while GLorpinax would follow in her mother's footsteps and become a boss in a hidden room full of gems. On Boris' deathbed his lovely wife held his schlorp appendage and wheeped tears of pure sulfuric acid. He reassured her this was not the end but merely a doorway to the next life. As he glorped his last blork his gell turned to grey dust and every single coin, bone, and spoon he had in him evacuated all at once out onto the bed.
</p>
<p>
	Boris gasped as he returned to the library. He was sweating bullets if they'd been invented yet. Yes I know that rat has a gun. And I'm ASSUMING it shoots bullets. Save it for the wiki ya dorks.
</p>
<p>
	Boris had lived an entire life as a cube. Where was he? Who was he? He still felt the love of his wife Glorbonzo deep in his heart? He had a heart. He was Boris. He was a vampire in a library reading a magical book on a magical Candle that could transport you into a story. A lot like a holodeck but for fantasy nerds. Yeah. Didn't think I could put holodecks in a fantasy story did you ya dinguses? Dont' ever question my superiority and genius again! 
</p>
<p>
	"Did ya check over there you stupid son of  a dickless bitch" another female voice said from below. 
</p>
<p>
	"Shit" Boris thought as he gathered himself. "MIST FORM" he whispered as he turned into a black mist and hovered up into the stoney cieling above nestling into the shadows.
</p>
<p>
	"Did you 'ear dat" a gravely voice said.
</p>
<p>
	"Keep looking ya turd muncher" another voice said. "We need to find this tome or its our asses on a pike. And I do mean like ON a pike not like we're gonna get spanked with the pike like you like so much, Slit"
</p>
<p>
	Boris could see the faint light of a torch moving toward him. Instictively he inched backward into the shadows more. Soon he saw a tall dark haired woman wearing a very revealing gown. Like full blown nips were showing. Like they were half moonin' over the itty bitty top of her gown. She had to know those aereolas were getting aired out. Behind her were 3 goblins. Each as nasty and buck wild as the next.
</p>
<p>
	"I do like me a good spank and prod, Slash" said Slit.
</p>
<p>
	"Ur mum got a good spank and prod from my pike last night" said the third.
</p>
<p>
	"Skate, you ain't never even met my mum. She lives in Blobbington with my step dad Larry so there's like ZERO chance you got to fuck her. But I do recommend it if you get the chance. Being filthy goblins we do that sort of nasty shit and all but you know that ur a goblin I'm just expositing for any potention eaves droppers and lookers on."
</p>
<p>
	"QUIET MORONS" the woman said. "We are not alone....AMELIUS BEDILIUS" she shouted raising a single finger. Suddenly a bright flash of light hit Boris right in his peepers. 
</p>
<p>
	"AH FUCK OH SHIT" Boris said as his mist form faded and he fell from the ceiling.
</p>
<p>
	"Looks like we got ourselves a wee vampy" Slit said licking his lips.
</p>
<p>
	Boris shielded his eyes and tried to squint the bright light out of them but he was seeing those shapes you see when you rub your eyes a whole bunch. Like little animals and shit.
</p>
<p>
	"Now why would a pathetic little vampling be skulking around a library in the middle of the night?" The woman said as she glided over to Boris. She held a single finger still blazing with holy light under his chin and got her boobies like really close to his face. Like he took a peak because I mean...they were right there ya know?
</p>
<p>
	"Its pronounced LIBARY" Boris said defiantly.
</p>
<p>
	"Doooooon't let her find meeeeee" the disembodied voice said
</p>
<p>
	Both Boris and the Dark Woman looked up. THey both heard the same voice.
</p>
<p>
	"You can hear her can't you" said the Dark Woman.
</p>
<p>
	"Mistress Axewound" Skate said. "Uhh like it would be totally bodacious of you if we could snarf on this Vamps flesh and just pig out on his innards ya know?"
</p>
<p>
	"SILENCE" Axewound said snapping her head around without turning her body. Just her head just like fully Exorcisting around. This freaked Boris out because that is not usually how necks work.
</p>
<p>
	"We can use this Vampling. Take him down into the pit" Axewound snapped her finger. As she did a black crab handed spiderling appeared and chittered its way down her fingers. She held out her hand as it lay in wait in her open hand. Boris froze. Not with fear but with rigid unatural magic like that time I took 2 viagra because "fuck it why not we got this hotel room all weekend I'm gonna party like its 1999"
</p>
<p>
	The spiderling crawled and clawed its way into Boris ear canal. He tried to scream but honestly, honey, this wasn't the weirdest thing thats ever been in his ear. Springbreak 6969 BABY BABY!
</p>
<p>
	FInally with a CRUCNH the spiderling snapped into Boris' thoughts.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh hi I'm Roy I'll be your thought parasite for the duration of this quest. If you need to think anything or have something you'd like to share with our Lord and Queen the Great Axewound please just think it and I'll translate those thoughts into dark magic and transmit them right away"
</p>
<p>
	Boris was silent. He tried to think of anything but the voice he had heard. Boobies. Axewounds boobies. Aeriolas. Nipples. Triple H Hangers. Where was he gonna hang out later? Axewounds voice. ASMR VIDEOS. THE VOICE of the WOMAN GHOST SHIT
</p>
<p>
	"Gotcha little man" Axewound said as the Goblins dragged his narc sorry ass down into the pit.
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
