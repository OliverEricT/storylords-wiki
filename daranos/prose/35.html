Cryptids and Passages

A Very Daranos Holiday: Battle at Crash Canyon

 A quiet whoosh washed over Daranos as the wind softly cut through the pussywillows. The BBW's (Big Blowing Willows) rocked back and forth like corndogs on sticks or like when you use your peener to knock on someone's door because it makes a louder noise than your fist. TRGW's love this one weird trick.

A single snowflake fell as the weather began to chill. The streets of Graal were silent. Everyone was inside by their hearths probably drinking cider or doing it doggy style or something. The cold only highlighted the quiet as a shadowy figure skulked on the rooftops. On his back was a hefty sack just like the one your dad carries around after I'm done with your mama because she ain't giving him no doggy style for the holidays because I satisfied her sexual needs so completely.

The shadowy figure grunted as he dropped the satchel. It hit the roof with a thud.

"GASP". With a start Tina awoke in her bed. Her eyes were wide as she was mostly pretending to be sleeping. The exitement of the 8 days of Jawnica had been her source of insomnia for a week and this, the 7th night of Jawnica, promised to be a real good one. Everyone knows you get the best presents on the 7th day. Tina listened closer. Maybe she had imagined the noise on the roof?

Jawnica of course being one of the most celebrated holidays in Daranos. One who's history is said to go back to an ancient mechanized city of advanced peoples who lived by the wooders of the Smellaware River. A diverse people said to eat the flesh of animals with yellow cheese and who would crush any and all hitchiking automobots that entered the city. Go Birds FUck Dallas.

THUD. Another noise a little louder and farther toward the living room this time.

"I fuckin KNEW IT" Tina whisper yelled as she shot upright in bed. She quickly pulled off her little Dickenzian sleeping hat to reveal 2 pointed ears that were now twitching in anticipation and searching for more auditory evidence of HIM!

She quickly grabbed a candle and lit it with what little magic she knew. Slowly she krept out of her room trying to anticipate and avoid any creaking floor boards. If her moms knew she was out of bed they'd surely put her back to bed and maybe even use some sleeping powder on her that her mom, Trudy, took sometimes at night to quote "make the all see ball calls go away". Hey...parents used to give their kids heroine when they had a fuckin sinus infection so I don't want to hear any pissing and moaning. Trudy and Judy are doing the best they can.

Tina creeeeeept quitly into the living room where the 7 of the 8 Jawnica Bongs were lit making the room glow in a festive green haze of merry Dankment. Tina slowly looked over the couch, her eyes squinting to see. There he was....in all his hairy glory?

"REESES CLAUSE!?" Tina whisper shouted.

"OH FUCK ME IN THE DICK HOLES" the figure said as it bolted upright. It turned around to reveal an 8 foot tall....something covered in black and brown hair from head to toe. Tina could barely make out his yellow eyes and yellowed teeth.

"Uhhhh YES....YES its me...(cough) Reeses Clause here to.....inspect....yes inspect your presents this year little......"

"TINA!" Tina replied in excitement. "I didn't know you were so hairy Reeses. I always thought you were an elderly old man with some kind of heavy metal poisoning" she finished.

"NOW HOLD ON A MINUTE" Reeses shouted at his all see ball from inside of his castle's living room. "I'm going to get my advocate on the all see horn and sue the pants off of these writers. This is libel bordering on slander bordering on hot goss bordering on pure hearsay" he said as he sat next to a giant vat of liquified silver metal with "Quicksilver" written on the side. 

"What was I saying oh well time go stand in the middle of the aisle at the grocery store and then use the self check out lane with 2 full carts worth of groceries."

"OH noooo little Tina its me....Reeses the Clause. Like I said just packing up these gifts here so that I can check if they are uh....WORTHY of Jawnmas or whatever I called this holiday." The figure said.

Tina squinted suspiciously but after giving it 2 miliseconds of thought she decided that was plausible because all kids are dumb as fuckin rocks.

"OKAY!" She said excitedly. "Reeses don't forget to drink your beer and cocktail onions" Tina said pointing over to a glass of warm beer and some old cocktail onions in a jar.

"Ohhh yes thank you little Tina I wouldn't want to miss out on those hu hu hu" the figure said pretending to take the jar.

"Are you gonna go up the chimney now!??" Tina said clapping her hands and hopping up and down.

"Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuure" the figure said hiding his lockpicking set within her black fur. "That is definitely the way I came in and definitly the way I am going to leave...."

Tina's smile was wider than a Batman character hopped up on Smilex. She was breathing heavily through her teeth watching ''Reeses Clause" try to fit up the chimney

"OH fuck me this is....this is how that dad died in Gremlins" he said as he struggled to get his legs under him to push himself up into the chimney.

"Do you need any help!?" Tina shouted up the chimney at him.

"NO no little Tina Reeses Clause has this....just go....just go back to bed like a good little elf....for fuck sakes....this....this fuckin sucks. This worse than crawling out of your sweet mama's love hole. Dirtier too. And with way more carcinogens." he said.

Tina lay her head back down on the pillow and closed her eyes. "Goodnight Reeses Clause" she whispered as she fell into a peaceful sleep knowing that the next day Reeses will have inspected her gifts and made sure they were perfect.

"HEY WAIT A MINUTE!" She shouted in sudden realization.

12 Hours Later:

"Alright Angels. The city needs you to find the this so called Jawnica Jester. This mook has been stealin gifts from all over da city" Mayor Joey Pizza said through the all see ball.

"Mayor Pizza please stop calling us your Angels" Sid said with a sigh.

"I kind of like it." Peppercorn said

"No can do Siddo." Mayor Pizza went on. "This is too important a case for me to start changing up tradition. Besides, I already got Gary to be your Bosly."

Gary waved from the corner wearing a tie and jacked along with a balding man's wig skullcap. "I'm helping!" he said.

"Find dis here pilfering piece of piss and QUICK" Joey went on. "I won't have my first Jawnica ruined before the first automobot beating even starts. Get it done Angels" with that he shut off the All see ball.

"Who would steal presents from little kids on Jawnica?" Chic Pea asked as she let out a long puff of Daranosian Dank from her little pipe. "I mean I can see stealing presents from princes and kings and shit but little kids? They don't even have any good loot!" she went on. "Unless they're rich kids in which case.....hmmmmmm" she took a long thoughtful drag of dank and squinted her clearly plotting eyes.

"FLAMINGOS PLEASE PLEASE HELP" a little girls voice shouted. Suddenly a little elven girl burst through the door of Flamingo Secret Hideout LLC. "PLEASE FLAMINGOS HELP" she said panting out of breath as she leaned against a bar stool.

"Hey...you 21 kid?" Fred asked sternly.

"I'm 12..." Tina said.

"Close enough" Fred replied as he went back to washing dishes.

"SLow down little girl. First things first what is your name?" Sid said trying to calm this little yapping child puppy.

"I'm Tina!" she said as if he was supposed to know that.

"hey TINY TINA I GET IT" Chic Pea said from across the room.

"I know...." She sighed out out of breath. "I know who has been stealing all the presents!"

Gary gasped over dramatically. "Another case solved well done Angels" he said.

"Who....who is taking the gifts" Sid said with a smile humoring her.

"It was....BUGFOOT!"

Gary gasped over dramatically. "I have never heard of him but I assume this is a big deal?"

"(snort laugh) Bugfoot is not real little girl. In all my years of cryptozoological research I have never seen a complelling argument to suggest such a monster could or does exist." Peppercorn said condescendingly. "Besids...Bigfoot? Sure they're all over the place. Bugbears? Sure they sometimes wander into cities to lick street signs and do whatever weird ass shit they're into....but BUGFOOT (Snort laughing)."

"I saw him" Tina said defiantly. "I saw him dressed as Reeses Clause and he stole my presents. My mom's said they got me Crash Canyon! The board game where you drive monster trucks up a mountain!"

"I believe her." Chic Pea said not even looking over at them.

"Can you describe him?" Sid said taking mental notes.

"Ok...OKAY YEAH!" Tina sat at the bar and took out a colorful quil and began to draw on those bar things that have ads on them.

"He looked like this!" She saaid as she held up a blackened furball of a creature complete with yellow eyes and teeth.

Sid examined the sketch. "Well that sure doesn't look like Reeses Clause..." he said flipping the picture upside down.

"YEAH!" Tina agreed. "Plus he smelled like hot piss and regret" Tina quickly grabbed the picture adding stink lines.

"So it COULD have been Reeses" Peppercorn laughed to himself.

Somewhere in Reeses Castle, Reeses himself was still watching this holiday special on the all see ball. "OH COME ON" he shouted. "THIS IS JUST PURE HATERADE AT THIS POINT" he said squirting a tube of canned cheese into his mouth but missing causing most to go into his now orange beard. "If I wasn't so busy with....magic...I'd go on all see book and post the MOST TRUE AND SCATHING post about these so called Joey's Angels."

Suddenly a scream echoed from outside.

"EEEEE HELP SOMEONE STOLE MY KID'S ROUND WHEEL AND STICK PUSHING GAME" a woman shouted.

Both Fred and Sid shot up and bolted out the door. There, on a rooftop across the way, they saw a black figure with a hulking sack duck out of sight. Both men looked at each other and knodded. Sid took off toward the fire escape while Fred, who never skipped leg day, did a powersault up onto the rooftop in one bound. Sid soon arrived at the rooftop and unsheathed Socks. Fred ran toward the figure and slid to a stop as the roof gaveway to the streets below. On the streets the mob was already gathering for the Automobot Hunt and Hitchihiker round up. The figure leapt  from rooftbop to rooftop like he was Neo in John Wick.

Fred slid to a stop not sure if he could make the jump but Sid flew past him, leapt into the air, did a front flip and landed perfectly in a run. He swung socks and cut a pipe in half that was in his way. Not to be outdone, Fred jumped Hulk style and landed on teh other side taking out a few tiles with him. The figure turned around to see Sid hot on his trail. He took a gift out of his sack and threw it back at Sid hitting him right in the face. It squeaked as it hit his tusks.

Sid dropped Socks but he quickly turned back into a cat and was running full sprint next to his friend.

Fred got to another rooftop's end and sighed. "How many of these things am I gonna have to jump?" he said readying himself for another leap of faith. He backed up a bit and used all his strenght to jump this void, which was much farther than the last few. Midway through his jump gravity took over and...."SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT" he said as he fell down 3 stories and crashed into a dumpster.

He rolled out and grunted as he hit hte ground.

"THERE'S ONE!" Shouted a member of the angry mob. Soon a streetfull of angry rioters waving clubs was decending upon Fred.'

"What no I'm a man you stupid cheesesteak eating jabronis" he shouted, but soon realized he was covered in boxes and metal vents and tubes making him look like an automobot.

"Well piss" he said as the crowd starting clanging away on his metal frame.

Up on the rooftop click click click was the sound of a magical blunder buster being loaded by the mysterious black figure. As he jumped to another rooftop he deftly spun mid jump and fired one shot at Sid.

Sid's eyes went wide as he realized he was also mid jump and couldn't change direction. With a THUD a bolt of white hot magic hit him right in the chest sending him backward back onto the rooftophe had just leapt from. SLAM. He slammed down onto the tiles and grabbed at his chest. Socks skid to a stop and turned to look at his friend.

"Its ok Socks...." Sid groaned as he pulled open his tunic. "It was only a level .22 caliber bolt....its merely a flesh wound." Socks still licked his friends face as healing cat lick magic leeched into Sid's body healing him quickly.

Both Sid and Fred returned to the hideout.

"Welp....Bugfoots real and he's a dick!" Fred said as he grabbed a block of ice for his many many club bludgeoning bruises.

"You guys smell like butts that farted out poop" Chic Pea said as she was dolling up Tina's hair into a style remincent of Chic Pea's own hair style.

"How do we find this piece of holiday SHIT!" Sid said seething with anger. Nobody shoots Sid. Nobody shoots Sid and lives to tell the tale. Nobody shoots Sid, lives to tell the tale, and lives to sire a child to pass down their SID SHOOTING GENES!

"If we had a lowly creature we could like....use it to find its scent. If it smells half as bad as you idiots should be easy" Chic Pea said laughing. Tina laughed too and popped a candy ruby into her mouth.

"Wait....." Sid said as he smiled widly. "I have an idea".

The back garage door opened slowly as Radar Love began to play. Inside 2 bonercycles revved and shot out of the passageway at lightning speed. Atop one Fred sat with a cigar in his mouth. Sid was on the other. Both had sidecars for Chic Pea and Peppercorn who wasn't with them having said and I quote "Good luck on your nerd hunt nerds I have an all see camgirl to woo".

Chic Pea sat in Sid's sidecar wearing goggles and cackling like a maniac.

"ALRIGHT LET HIM LOOSE" Fred shouted to Chic.

Chic Pea then whipped out her staff and swirled it around teleporting Flyman on a leash up into the air.

"Oh not again" he said as he began to fly reflexively. "USE THAT HUGE SNOOTER TO SNIFT OUT SOME OF THAT GROSS MUSK" Chic Pea ordered.

"A leash? Really guys?" FLyman whined. "This is just like my honeymoon.......just kidding we never went on one because she was too busy at work and honestly we could spend that gold on better things like life insurance and plus I soon turned into horrendous monstrous fly person so..."

"SILENCE MULE!" Chic Pea said with another maniacal laugh. "USE THE LAMP ON YOUR HEAD TO SEE ANY HIDDEN TRACKS" She commanded. Flyman sighed and lit up a red lantern on his head like those old coal miner dudes had.

"ON FLYMAN ON DICKSWAN ON KRISTIN" Chic Pea yelled using a small whip to whip Flyman.

Tina chuckled as she lay hidden in Fred's side car underneath the cover. She peered out and popped another candy ruby into her mouth smiling all the way.

The bonercycles came to a slow halt at the foot of a large mountain.

"Mount Spooky Brought to you buy Chudweiser..." Fred said ominously. "Why did we let mega corps name things again? Seems like a bad idea now...."

Flyman landed exhausted from both the sheer amount of sniffing and the whip marks on his tiny bug booty.

"Ya did good, mule" Chic Pea said as she slapped him on the butt.

"GOOD JOB FLYMAN!" Tina said emphatically as she popped out from her hiding spot.

Each member of the Flamingos turned slowly to see a little tiny elf girl with red sugar all over her face smiling at them.

"Well piss" Fred said.

"Kid....this is dangerous you SHOULD NOT have come with" Sid scolded.

"Its ok she's an orphan no one will miss her" Chic Pea said.

"I'm not an orphan I have moms that love me" Tina said.

"Classic orphan denial...seen it a hundred times...maybe I'll adopt her and teach her my ways" Chic Pea said not listening to anyone but herself. "I will rename her CHICTUNIA and we will be unstoppable"

After a long climb up the mountain the adventurers found a large open valley. Inside the valley glowed like one of those drivethrough xmas things that people drive through and turn on their radios to listen to music. They might not have those in England. Cars that is. I'm not sure what you guys drive to work. Lories or some kind of tamed bears?

In the middle of hte valley Bugfoot was dancing and wrapping garland around himself. Goodbye Horses was playing as he twirled and twirled.

"Would you bug me? I'd bug me" he said weirdly to no one.

"This dude's fuckin weird man" Fred said getting up to turn back down the mountain.

Sid grabbed him. "Look...all the gifts. He's just hoarding them like a Smaug."

"Crash CANYON" Tina shouted. 

Just then the record scratched and stopped. Bugfoot looked straight up and saw the adventurers spying on his private "dancy me time" as he liked to call it.

"Awwww piss" Sid said with a sigh. He and Fred slid down the skree of the mountain said and landed in the valley ready for a fight.

"Do you guys want to see my favorite present I got this year!?" Bugfoot said. He pulled out a set of skeleton keys and hit the skeleton key fob. BWOOP BOOP.

Suddenly a huge monster bone truck ROARED to life from undernearth a mountain of gifts. It shot flame and black acrid soot from its horn like exhaust. He growled in an idle like a demonic cat until VROOOM it reared forweard inch by inch. Bugfoot was already inside of the truck before Fred or Sid could fathome what in the actual jumping the shark had happened.

Chic Pea was still atop the mountain guarding Tina. "Shit I need to make a call stay here kid...don't get double orphaned"

The monster bone truck revved again and shot out from the gifts. On the side was a picture of Bugfoot and it said BUGFOOT in huge lettering. Bugfoot laughed as he drove straight toward the two.

Fred and Sid both dodged, the truck barely missing them. It easily stood 2 to 3 stories above them. Flames singed their nostril hairs as the bone truck turned on a dime on 2 wheels and came at them again.

"I thought this was going to be a classic Grinch situation" Sid said diving agian out of the way.

"Yeah I thought this guy was gonna like grow another heart and become bipolar just like the Grinch does in that story" Fred said leaping left.

"You FOOLS" Bugfoot said laughing. "I dont want to learn the real meaning of Jawnica. The real meaning for ME is ME GETTING GIFTS! Do you know how many gifts a mythical creature gets for the holidays each year?"

Sid and Fred both said "3? or like 2 or 3" they said over each other.

"ZEROOOOOO" Bugfoot shouted. "IF NOBODY THINKS I'M REAL WHY WOULD HTEY BUY ME A PRESENT! WHY WOULD HTEY BUY ME A PRESENT, BART?!?!?!"

"Who's Bart?" Fred asked Sid.

SId and Fred both braced for the end. This truck was going to run them over and it was gonna suck. They squinted and braced for the impact but.....

Another set of headlights shot onto them and Bugfoot.

"Mazel TOV motherfuck!" Gunk said from atop his own bonetruck. Inside Chic Pea and Tina were strapped into seats.

Bugbear turned around and the two bone trucks sat at either end of the valley. This skeletal mechanical joust was only going to end one way. With one of them in the dirt like the dirt that they were. Jawnica wasn't about presents. It was about bone trucks and fucking up shit with your friends and loved ones. And saving a kids Jawnica because you'd want your jawnica saved too.

On the side of the once communal bone van of the Flamingos were the words "Gunkasaurus FLEX". Both behemouths revved and lurched forward. Pure horsepower and torq made the ground shudder as they both released the brakes and hurdled toward their destiny. Chic Pea and Tina's smiles grew wider and wider the closer and closer they came to impact. Headlights blared into both cabins of the trucks almost blinding both Bugfoot and Gunk until....

(transformers sound)

Gunk hit a special red button causing the van side doors to burst open revealing 2 gargantuan automoton arms. The arms flexed and grabbed Bugfoot stopping it cold in its tracks. The arms then manouvered around and flipped Bugfoot upside down as the Gunkasaurus Flex did a front flip off of some presents and pile drove the Bugbear into the dirt silencing it forever.

"CRASH CANYON BABY!" Tina yelled laughing in excitment.

"What the hell is that!?" shouted an orc on the street of Graal. Coming down the street was a gigantic bone truck with a dwarf atop it along with Chic Pea and Tina.

"HO HO HO MOTHER TRUCKERS HAPPY JAWNICA" Gunk said from atop the truck as he threw presents down to the boys and girls of the crowd. Everyone cheered as this beared jolly man and his elv and gnome friends helped save Jawnica.

"You think this changed anything for him?" Fred asked Sid pointing to Gunk.

"I hope so....but for now he's having a good time so...thats all I care about" Sid smiled and cheered as Tina held up Crash Canyon the board game.

Meanwhile back at Mount Spooky brought to you by CHudweiser.

"Guys....guys are you coming back for me?" Flyman whined.

"ohhhhh I guess I'll walk...this is just like my honeymoon....."
