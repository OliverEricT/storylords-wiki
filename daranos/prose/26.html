	Echoes and Fathers
</p>
<p>
		Drip drip drip. Water slowly began to drip down into a murky puddle of god knows what that had been there for gods know how long. It was probably a mix of piss and jizz with a splash of poop. Or what I like to call "Fair Juice". You ever been to a fair on a really hot summer day and you walk by one of those big green trash cans? And then you hit a whiff of trash but its hot wet trash? And the next thing you notice is your shoe is kind of wet so oyou follow the water back to the green trash can. Low and behold you have discovered "Fair Juice". What is it? NO ONE KNOWS!
</p>
<p>
	With a SPLASH a small size  5 foot stampeded through it at break neck speed.
</p>
<p>
	"OI THATS GOOD FAIR JUICE THERE IT IS IT IS" said an old emaciated man in a cell near by.
</p>
<p>
	"Sorry Mr. I GOTTA GO SORRY" said a young girl with ratty hair. She turned only briefly to see the old man talking to himself.
</p>
<p>
	"Shame it is it is" said the man who was so skinny he was practically a skeleman. Maybe he was talking to the spooky skeleman inside his body who was just waiting to be birthed out of this old man's skin husk. Like a beautiful butterfly metamorphising out of some gross old man's meat sack.
</p>
<p>
	The girl continued to run through the dark tunnel running past all kind of filth and decay. She hurdled over a woman who was bent down to pick up a bunch of leather sandles.
</p>
<p>
	"MY SANDLES" the woman screamed as the girl almost tripped looking back at her.
</p>
<p>
	"SORRY I GOTTA GO" she said
</p>
<p>
	"Now what'm I gonna eat?" She said disapointedly as if the sandles fallling on the ground made them somehow inedible. "HENRY" she yelled for her husband. "WE GOTTA EAT YOUR OTHER TESTICAL TONIGIHT"
</p>
<p>
	"Oh mama mia not again" Henry said cupping his one remaining nad.
</p>
<p>
	Soon the girl burst through a rickety door in one of the side tunnels only to be met by a scowling old man tapping his gross old man finger on an old wooden door he was using as a desk.
</p>
<p>
	"GAL DARNIT DEMI I TOLD YOU ONCE AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE TO TELL YOU AGAIN" the old man yelled.
</p>
<p>
	"I know I know I'm sorry Gimble" She said as she immediately began to dust the old shelves full of detritus and dross.
</p>
<p>
	"You cannot be late AGAIN" Gimble said looking down at her as she continued to sweep as if she hadn't been a half hour late.
</p>
<p>
	"The tunnels were full of people and then I thought I saw a a piece of moldy bread but it turned out it was just a gangrenous foot that someone had left behind and so I thought for a second about eating that because I mean hey...meat is meat...."
</p>
<p>
	"ENOUGH" Gimble shouted. "As punishment you will have to......" he paused for dramatic effect...."FEED THE BEAST"
</p>
<p>
	"GULP" Demi gulped. "But...but GIMBLE I'm not THAT LATE"
</p>
<p>
	"AH AH AH" Gimble shushed. "Take this bucket full of old gym socks, toe nail clippings, used doggy bags, steak fries that clearly are innedible, a used condom, uh.....some kind of green chess piece that has a flaired base and looks like one of those russian buildings at the top"
</p>
<p>
	"Alright alright fine" Demi said grabbing the roped handled of the bucket. "But if I die I'm going to haunt you"
</p>
<p>
	"Ghosts aren't real Demi. Crazy kid and her imagination. Magick and ghosts. Get real." Gimble said as he began to cut his toenails as Demi walked out the old rickety door.
</p>
<p>
	Demi skipped daintily down a darkened tunnel. Then another. Then she slowed her pace down another. Finally she crept slowly down yet another as she neared the dungeons.
</p>
<p>
	"Just....gonna feed the beast and then not die" She said whispering to herself. All around her the sounds of pain and agony echoed through the dungeon's halls. This was no place for a little girl. Hell this wasn't even a place for a fully grown ass man who's done a stint in the Big House who got passed around so much his b-hole was like if Goatse had a butt baby with with your mama's cavernous oft used wang garage.
</p>
<p>
	As she neared a singlular wooden door with just one barred window at the top she tip toed slowly and carefuly.
</p>
<p>
	"Ok Mr The Beast....just gonna bring you some yummy....uh....steak fries" She said with a gag. She tip toed up to the door and raised the heavy bucket above her head to dump its disgusting contents in through the barred window. She hefted the bucket with all her might until most of the contents spilled out into the cell as the bucket itself fell beside her with a loud wooden clatter.
</p>
<p>
	From within the cell she heard a singular huff as if a set of massive lungs was breathing out in disgust at probably the steak fries and not the toenails and condoms. I'll eat a condom for a dare but a steak fry? What am I some kind of Starch Vampire? As Demi heard the chuff she became curious. She stood on her tip toes to see into the cell's window but at a staggering 4'3" inches she couldn't quite see over the doorway into the cell itself. She sighed with disappointment. Then with one last curiousity fueled burst of strentgth she held onto the window frame and pulled her frail and emaciated body up to look into the window.
</p>
<p>
	She saw....nothing. It was blacker than black yall and I'm black yall cause I'm blacker than black and I'm black yall.
</p>
<p>
	"Hello..." She whispered into the darkness. Suddenly a slash quicker than a blur shot across the barred window. Before pain could even reach her brain 3 hot scratches begane to bleed from her face just barely missing her left eye streaking downward to the right. She didn't even feel them as she fell in a panic to the ground and scurried away from the door on her butt backwards toward safety. Then with a single breath in from its massive lungs the Beast let out a roar that rattled Demi's ear drums. In a fit of panic she curled up in a fetal position and covered her face. Streaks of blood covered her arm as she burried her head into them. Then she looked up.
</p>
<p>
	In the window she saw a single yellow eye and a tear dripping from it. She frowned and felt tears well in her own eyes.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm sorry I scared you" she said genuinly. The eye blinked out and Demi made her way home.
</p>
<p>
	"THERE YOU ARE YOUNG LADY" A-Frame said as Demi strode into their tiny offshoot of a room down in the tunnels. "I was worried sick about you little one....don't ever do that to me..." he stopped suddenly noticing the scratches across her face.
</p>
<p>
	Demi tried to hide them and look away but A-Frame had already grabbed a greasy dirty rag to clean up the blood.
</p>
<p>
	"Gimble made me feed the beast" She said shyly
</p>
<p>
	"Gimble is a pile of jizz that should have ran down his mother's jizz crack" A-Frame said.
</p>
<p>
	"You're not supposed to say taht kind of stuff to kids A-Frame" Demi said with a smile.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah yeah I'm not your daddy and Gimble is the worst scrapper this side of the tunnels. I hope his peener gets run over by an automoton's roll ball and his balls pop like...well...something that pops real good I'm not good at this stuff" A-Frame said as he turned around and tried to clean off the dirty rag as best as he could.
</p>
<p>
	Demi ran up and hugged him. "You're not my dad but you look out for me" she said.
</p>
<p>
	"Alright Queen of Being Late it's time for bed" 
</p>
<p>
	The next morning Demi woke up to A-frame whistling some long forgotten tune that nobody knew where it came from. Then he started to sing.
</p>
<p>
	"Don't STOP BELIEVING" he belted out and then went back to humming since Demi didn't think he knew any of the other words. One a chair he was sitting and stitching together something.
</p>
<p>
	"Demi Good morning. COME IN HERE I have a gift for you" He said. Demi walked closer to him. In his hand she saw a stitched together old sack that said "Potatoes" on it and it was fashioned into a cloak.
</p>
<p>
	"Here. This will keep you safe from any Beasts" He said with a laugh. Demi held onto it and smelled it. It's rough burlap itched against her face and it smelled like summer camp if she had known what that was. She loved it instantly.
</p>
<p>
	"THANK YOU A-Frame" she said as she hugged him.
</p>
<p>
	"Alright now get going you're gonna be late again for your shift" A-frame shoo'd her out the door.
</p>
<p>
	As Demi made her way through the tunnels a speaker boomed overhead and throughout.
</p>
<p>
	"ALL GOLD MILKERS REPORT TO MILKING STATIONS. REGURGITATION WILL COMMENCE IN 3 STANDARD UNITS" A robotic and framiliar voice said. "FAILURE TO REGURGITATE DAILY QUOTAS WILL BE MET WITH......PENALTIES" the voice finished and clicked off. Further down the tunnels things got quieter. Demi couldn't see any other people and usually at this time of day there were people selling their junk everywhere. It wasns't until she took a few more steps that she realized why. There stood 2 golden automata arguing with each other.
</p>
<p>
	"THIS IS MY SHINY ROCK" said the #1
</p>
<p>
	"YOU HAVE MISCALCULATED. IT IS MY SHINY ROCK I SCANNED IT FIRST" #2 said then hit number one over its metal head with a stoogelike swing around hammer fist.
</p>
<p>
	"YOU RUSTY PIECE OF NON FEROUS SCRAP. I OUTTA TURN YOU INTO ALCHALOIDS" #1 said as it then returned the jab with a bump from his roller ball.
</p>
<p>
	Demi hid behind a corner and peered around it. She giggled as the two golden bots clanked and swatted at each other. She saw with her right eye that during this slapstick clinic, the one had dropped the shiny stone. As the two clanged and boinked and zatted against each other the red stone rolled toward Demi. She looked back at the automota to see if they had noticed and quickly grabbed the stone. But when she picked it up it was light. She looked at it puzzled. It had a stick on top of it. She smelled it. It smelled GOOD.
</p>
<p>
	"What the fart" she said. She went to bite it to see if it was valuable and to her surprised her teeth sunk right into its red juicy....meat? No ....it was....IT WAS SWEET! Her eyes lit up as she took another bite and savored the deliciousness of it as cool sweet juice ran down into her growling little stomach. Then as if snapping out of a trance she perked up and looked around. Nobody had seen her take this....this....red thing. She quickly covered it in her apron and snuk away.
</p>
<p>
	"GOD DANGIT DEMI UR LATE AGAIN" Gimble said as he was reading an old book upside down. "You know what that means don't ya young lady!" He said tapping the bucket she had used just a day before with his old wrinkly foot.
</p>
<p>
	Demi rolled her eyes and drug herself over to the bucket lifting it up expecting it to be empty but instead seeing its contents were again full of toe nails and just plain gross ass shit.
</p>
<p>
	"What the HELL GIMBLE!" She finally snapped. "How is this bucket full of toenails AGAIN?!! Where are they coming from? Is this the same bucket? Do you have like...just stores of toe  nail clippings that you feed the Beast with?"
</p>
<p>
	Demi looked down at his feet and saw that there was literal no way these toenails were Gimble's considering his yellow ass fungus filled nails were nearly curled around each one of his...1,2,3,4,5 8 toes. 8 TOES??! 
</p>
<p>
	"Mama Mia Gimble" Demi said lugging the bucket out of the shop door. "Of all the duxant sons a' bit" the door slammed behind her as she left.
</p>
<p>
	Again she crept her way down to the dungeon where this time she was even MORE careful not to make a sound. After yesterday's run in with the Beast she did not want another set of scars. Although she thought, they probably made her look cool like a hero adventurer. Too bad there weren't any more of them around. 
</p>
<p>
	"Your imaginations gonna get you in trouble and so is all this talk of wizards and magick and swashbuckling" She said quitly to herself immitating Gimble.
</p>
<p>
	"8 toe'd bitch" she thought to herself PG-13ly.
</p>
<p>
	When she reached the door that she had been to yesterday she again spoke quietly to the beast.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm just here to feed you Mr The Beast...again....Pleasse don't slash my face off or kill and eat my fluids please" She pleaded. She looked once again down into the bucket. Not even anything named THE BEAST should have to eat this slop. Then she remembered the red stone. She dropped the bucket spilling steak fries every which way and hurriedly unwrapped the part of her raggety ass apron that hid the red thing. She held it up to the torch light. It's skin glowed and shown brightly reflecting the light. She smelled the sweet scent of the thing and contemplated eating the whole thing in one bite as this was more food than she had seen in a tick tock.
</p>
<p>
	But no. She held the stone up to the window and said "Here Mr The Beast. This is some actual good food"
</p>
<p>
	She waved the thing around until a single giant paw with metalic claws reached out and gently grabbed the stone.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" it said softly through the door as it retracted its muscly ass paw back into the cell.
</p>
<p>
	"THERE SHE IS GET HER" Automata #2 shouted
</p>
<p>
	"THERE SHE IS GET...I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY THAT" #1 said.
</p>
<p>
	"SHE HAS THE SHINY STONE. WE HAVE TO SHOW IT TO THE MASTER"
</p>
<p>
	"NO I WILL SHOW IT TO HIM AND HE WILL MAKE ME A REAL BOY" #1 replied hopefully.
</p>
<p>
	#2 then reached its claw like hand out and grabbed Demi by the neck. She gasped and gagged as the robot lifted her tiny body up against the door and scanned her with a red beam eminating from the crystal within its forehead.
</p>
<p>
	"DEMI. SCRAPPER ASSISTANT. USEFULLNESS: NOT VERY" it said completing the scan. "TERMINATION ADVISED" The automata then used its other arm to staple Demi's  body and arms and legs to the wooden door. The gold staples were the size and thickness of javelins and they pierced through the door behind Demi pinning her in place. 
</p>
<p>
	She let out a scream as the automota began to make their crystals glow
</p>
<p>
	"DISINTIGRATION IN 3,2,...." But they never reached one as a giant paw shot out through the barred window and grabbed the first robot's face with his metalic covered claws. The arm flexed and popped the bars out of place bending them to its will like butter on your mama's hot lap beef on a 90 degree August night. That's about 32 degrees for you Celsius fucks.
</p>
<p>
	The giant paw then squeezed. It's metal claws ripping through the gold casing of the robot. Sparks and wires zitted and zatted as shorts and connections were broken.
</p>
<p>
	"THAT IS WHERE MY BRAIN LIVES" the Automata shouted and then powered down forever.
</p>
<p>
	The paw then pulled the crystal back into the cell and with a single explosion blew the lock off the door. This also caused the door to destabilize and Demi fell to the ground as she hurriedly tried to get the gold rods off from around herself.
</p>
<p>
	There in the now destroye doorway stood a 7 foot tall ripped as all fuck cat. He roared in anger and showed his fangs. Behind him a mace for a tail swooshed around like all pissed off like cats do.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh shiiiii" Demi started but was interupted by the other automata.
</p>
<p>
	"OH SHIT" He said spinning on his ball wheel. But it was too late. The Buff Cat had grabbed it's neck and lifted it off the ground as its ball wheel spun out in place and made cartoony wheel screech sound effects.
</p>
<p>
	As the Buff Cat lifted it up it began to scream "I DO NOT WISH TO BE A REAL BOY I DO NOT WISH TO BE A REAL BOY IF THIS IS WHAT PAIN IS I DO NOT WISH TO FEEL FEELINGS" and then Buffcat suplexed the robot back into the cell room. Before the robot even knew what happened he was again lifted into the air this time by both of the beast's enourmous claws gripping the top of it's brain case. With a single tear the Beast ripped the robot intwain. It's parts spilled out onto the stone floor and clanged around like a kid dumping his hoto wheels out onto the living room floor.
</p>
<p>
	"Wow you're stong" Demi said coming into the cell.
</p>
<p>
	Buffcat looked down and saw the golden staple javelins strewn about. He also saw a tiny skinny little girl who looked like she hadn't eaten in weeks. But around her neck was a cloak. Buffcat smiled.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" he said
</p>
<p>
	"Me? I'm not an adventurer I'm just a scrapper. I've never seen ANYTHING like you before though. You some kind of Strong Feline? Are there more  of you? Where do you come from? Do you know what that thing is I gave you?" She stopped cold as she looked around the cell. All around were mathematical formulae, phrases, words in languages Demi didn't recognize from any of Gimble's nudie mags. She read one she could barely understand.
</p>
<p>
	"All Mew and No Mew make Mew Mew a Dull Mew" She read slowly. Buffcat was fast at work shaping the golden staples into a a sort of hodge podge long spear. He held out his giant fluffy paw and handed Demi a  single straightened out staple.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" he said gesturing for her to take it.
</p>
<p>
	She held it and looked at it like Babe Ruth had just given her a soccer ball signed by Bo Jackson with Michael Jordan's favorite Sharpie.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" Buffcat said pointing to a crude scratched drawing in the wall. It was of some kind of pedestal. Demi had seen one before down in the depths but rumour had it the Master had it moved to a temple in the Above.
</p>
<p>
	"I know where that is!" She said excitedlly. "But...we can't get to it or we'll die."
</p>
<p>
	"Mew!" Buffcat said 
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah its in the Above. We're not allowed up there and anyone who goes up there never  comes back. A-Frame told me he saw it once but....A-FRAME!" Demi realized that if they knew to find her here that they could have found her home. She ran quickly out the cell door as Buffcat followed behind. 
</p>
<p>
	Demi burst through the rickety door into the single stone room to see nothing but a pile of ash sitting in the middle of the floor.
</p>
<p>
	She ran over to it falling to her knees. She grabbed at the dust picking it up as if she could piece the parts back together with sheer force of will. As if she could reform the jigsaw puzzle of her friends destroyed life.
</p>
<p>
	She cried into the ash making her hands dark with soot. Buffcat knelt beside her and put a single paw on her shoulder. 
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" he said softly.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah I'm sorry too. He wasn't my father...." She explained. "He was better than any father....he let me curse" she said crying into a small laugh.
</p>
<p>
	And then something inside of her shifted. Like a gear shifting into a higher gear. She looked down at her hands covered in the soot of her dead friend. She took her 3 fingers of her right hand and smeared the ash over the scars on her face creating 3 dark lines. War paint.
</p>
<p>
	She turned to Buffcat and simply said "Lets get the fuck out of here"
</p>
<p>
	As they made their way through the tunnels alarms of all sorts blared. Over the loud speaker warnings were issued.
</p>
<p>
	"ATTENTION: BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A 7 FOOT TALL CAT AND A LITTLE GIRL. THEY ARE FUGITIVES. DO NOT HELP THEM OR YOU WILL BE TURNED TO DUST. THANK YOU AND HAVE A GREAT DAY" 
</p>
<p>
	Buffcat killed or tore apart any and all obstacles in his way. Demi cheered as he used one automata as a flail against another one using its ball wheel as a club and then ripping the surviving robots arms off so it couldn't grieve his dead commrade. That robot would later retire and have vivid robot nightmares about his dead partner but little did he know that his partner was banging his robot wife and he probably deserved to die.
</p>
<p>
	Soon the pair reached a hatch that led to the Above. 
</p>
<p>
	"This is the way up" She said with a nervous stutter.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew mew mew" Buffcat reassured her. He then gripped the giant wheely opener thing that safe's have and lifted the metal hatch.
</p>
<p>
	Above a blast of hot spicy air hit Demi's face. Sand blasted her cheeks and she was sure that it took a few freckles off. She squinted as the brightest lilght she  had ever seen burned into her not oft used retinas. She shielded her eyes with her hand and slowly became acclimated to the light. All around she saw red. The sky was red. The sand was red. In the distant giant mechanical walking automata scoured the wasteland hitting rocks with red scanning beams. Above her she saw asteroids floating in the sky freely as if they were placed there by some great hand.
</p>
<p>
	"Whoa" she said mouth agape as she looked straight up.
</p>
<p>
	"MEW MEW" Buffcat pointed toward a ruined building. It was the only structure that either of them could see. Buffcat was pretty sure that this was the only structure left on this plane of existence. Both hurridly ran toward the stone ancient looking megalythic structure. It looked closer than it was since it was massive. Just like when you put a sideview mirror next to my dick! Objects in the mirror are closer than they APPEAR BITCH NOW GET THAT MIRROR OUT OF HERE WE GONNA FUCK. WHY YOU BRINGING A MIRROR TO FUCK ANYWAY YA WILD ASS FILTHY HO SHIT?!
</p>
<p>
	Panting both companions reached an empty cavernous room. There in the middle stood the object that Buffcat had drawn on his cell wall.
</p>
<p>
	"There it is!" Demi shouted as she started to run toward it. "What do you think it is"
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" Buffcat said curtly.
</p>
<p>
	"A....a portal? To where?" She asked running a hand over its surface.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew mew" 
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly a great rumble rattled throuoghout the entire temple. Buffcat reached out to hold Demi up as she fell backward. Both struggled to keep their feet under them. A red magical haze filled the entirety of the temple followed by runic crimsom magic that swirled around. Then from the ground bubbled gold. Pure gold. It pooled together like the tar monster that killed Tasha Yar. Slowly it rose up and formed the shape of shoulders and then a head and then legs complete with feet to carry it forward. And forward it walked, stepping out of its own pool of creation.
</p>
<p>
	"You..." it said in a soft gentle voice. There it stood. A slender and muscular golden adonis. Pure butt ass nude. It's face entirely too human and his donger entirely too big for my liking. I mean...he could try to fit that thing in my b-hole but I assure you I will not enjoy it for one second. In fact he should try it! I'll prove it to you how much I hate it. Go on stick in there and see how much my innocent completely heterosexual butthole hates this golden god's giant Blacked.com size peener.
</p>
<p>
	"The Master..." Demi said as she relexively bowed down slightly.
</p>
<p>
	"My child....Scrapper #696420....Designation Demi" the golden man said gently. Red magic shot all around him lifting him up into the air off his feet so that he no longer needed to use his own fabricated legs to move. As he floated over to them Buffcat flicked his claws out and readied his gold spear.
</p>
<p>
	"My feline friend that is not necessary and completely useless" the man said as he flicked a finger melting the golden spear. The fluid congealed and shlorped itself back into the golden beings essence. He smiled as it entered him. Again...I would HATE for this man to kiss me.
</p>
<p>
	Demi looked over to see her spear was unefected but she instantly dropped it out of fear. It clanged to the ground causing the golden man to look over at her.
</p>
<p>
	She hurriedly picked up the spear again and held it outward toward the golden man.
</p>
<p>
	"Very brave little one" he said smiling. "But you have broken the rules. Not only that but you have entered my sacred temple. So if its nothing to you I will be killing you now"
</p>
<p>
	"MEW" Buffcat shouted as he placed a hand onto the altar causing it to glow red and start up with a thrum.
</p>
<p>
	"You.....you know how to use this device..." The Gold Man said almost surprised. Like as if h e couldn't even believe how he was saying the words. This creature was never surprised. He laughed a bit at this new sensation. Surprise. 
</p>
<p>
	"Don't TOUCH MY FRIEND" Demi shouted as she held out the spear again. "We're taking this portal OUT OF HERE" 
</p>
<p>
	"A portal......yes.....yes of course that is what this is. It has resisted my dark magic for eons. Alwlays defying my endless curiousity. Always leaving me with questions. Always cock blockin me if you will. I kept it around because it....fascinates me. But a portal....oh to where I wonder or.....TO WHEN!" With that the Golden Man lunged forward and grabbed Buffcast around the neck holding him up just like Buffcat had done to the drone back in the dungeon.
</p>
<p>
	"NO" Demi shouted as she pounded her fist against this golden god's leg. But it was like throwing your gun at superman's dick.
</p>
<p>
	The Golden Man laughed and shoved Demi aside just like the trash she scavenged for. She hit the stones with a thud. By now the Machine was whirring loudly. Around the circled pedestal red runes of power hummed to life. Each was a different symbol and one was the COOL S? I guess that's where it comes from then! 
</p>
<p>
	Demi felt the tears well in her eyes as she watched her new friend's life being drained from him. Then she felt the click inside her brain again. She gritted her teeth and grabbed the golden staple spear. With all her strength she pulled herself up and gripped the heavy gold object tighter and tighter. She gripped so tightly she felt like she could break it in twain. Slowy the bar got light and lighter...and colder and colder. Demi used her fear and pain and the spear got lighter and lighter. She saw Buffcat's face struggle and gasp for one last taste of air.
</p>
<p>
	Then with a scream she plunged the spear into the Gold Man's thigh. 
</p>
<p>
	With a scream he immediately dropped Buffcat as his body rolled into the center of the now fully powered pedestal. Demi shielded her eyes as she ran over to check on her new friend. He was unconsious. As she looked back she could see the spear sticking out of the man's leg. But where it was once gold it was  now frozen into a blue icy pike.
</p>
<p>
	The man howled as his arms flailed turning back into liquid gold. His body split and morphed around itself like Alex Mack on bath salts. It squeeled and hissed and bit and spit. It yelled and howled and growled and moaned. It's legs turned into spikes. Then 2 more spikes and then 2 more and so on. It's hands were claws now grasping at the blue splinter in its leg but as soon as it touched the pike it hissed in pain again. It's head slowly dripped down off of its core as it would then slurp it back upright into a head like position before the whole dance would go again. Like a howling sick yo yo this things head reared down and up before it finally got its head upright like your impotent daddy did the night he squirted you out of his dusty old jizz bag.
</p>
<p>
	Finally the last thing Demi saw was The Master's head turning slowly to look at her. But where once was a beautiful man face now was a skull. A horned ancient fanged skull. In place of eyes were red lights glowing with fire and panic and hatred. It laughed as Demi saw a woosh of red arcane energy and then white.

	Ugla sat on the beach near Reese's condo. The night sky was clear. Inside she could hear Reeses telling Squib about something called a TV show where a furry creature named ALF was adopted by a family and how it was the single greatest show ever made. 
</p>
<p>
	She sighed and ran her fingers through the white sands. One last time she looked out at the waves and saw....something. She squinted her eyes and saw nothing. As the waves pushed in she saw it again. Ok there was definitely something out there. She stood up and saw 2 bodies. One big and one small.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh...Oh my gods" she said. "RAFTOLIO" she said witha flourish. Just then a magical raft appeared under the two castaways as a magical sail billowed outward and blew them toward the shore.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla ran over to the now beached magical water craft. It slowly began to dissolve back into the ether as the two bodies hit the sandy shore. By now Reeses and Squib had run outside to see what was going on and were near the survivors.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla knelt down and saw.....
</p>
<p>
	"BUFFCAT!!!" She yelled checking his pulse. He was alive but knocked out. She looked down to see a little girl wearing a potato sack for a cape. The little girl slowly opened her eyes blinking the salt and sandn out. Her eyes were red and burnt like she looked at the suns too long. As they began to clear she saw Ugla's face and said....
</p>
<p>
	"Mom?"
</p>
<p>
	FIN
</p>
<p>
	End Credit scene

<p>
	Reeses turned to Squib as Squib's jaw dropped. Reeses then let out the longest and loudest "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" that was ever filmed before a studio audience.
