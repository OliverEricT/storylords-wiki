	Previously on Daranos TNG:
</p>
<p>
	"Give it to me straight, Doc" Flyman said sadly to his doctor.
</p>
<p>
	"Mr. Man there is nothing PHYSICALLY wrong with you. But with the amount of depression you are experiencing I'd say you have 6 weeks to live....just try to avoid any mirrors and thinking about anything at all."
</p>
<p>
	"Oh...well thats a relief, Doc" Flyman said as he exited the office.
</p>
<p>
	The doctor whispers to the nurse next to him "I give it until the end of the week"
</p>
<p>
	BOOM
</p>
<p>
	"DAD!" Darick yelled as he grabbed a bundle of mail from the mail stork. "It's here...."
</p>
<p>
	Darick eyed a glossy envelope with the initials WY in collegiate style font.
</p>
<p>
	"Well open it up son!" The Mirkmonk said smiling in anticipation.
</p>
<p>
	Darick began to read the scroll. "Dear Darick the Mirkmonk...we reget to inform you....." Daricks shoulders sank but he continued to read. "We regret to inform you that you will not be attending The Druid Academy this year.....because....." He let out a long sigh...."Because you have been accpeted into Wizard Yale which is a much better and cooler school with betteer parties and magical chicks and dudes with big tits and dongers!"
</p>
<p>
	"YOu did it son!" The Mirkmnok said whiping a tear from his eye.
</p>
<p>
	"I can't....beleive it!" Darick said smiling so wide you could see his urethra.
</p>
<p>
	Johnson, the robin from next tree over suddenly peered over the branch to see what all the commotion was about.
</p>
<p>
	"Hey Mirkmonk ya got that weed whacker I loaned you last spring?" Johnson asked innocently.
</p>
<p>
	"FUCK OFF JOHNSON I'M HAVING A MOMENT WITH MY COLLEGE BOUND SON. IF YOU DON'T GET OFF MY PROPERTY I'LL TAKE YOUR WEED WHACKER AND I'LL REALLY PUT THE ACHE IN YOUR CLOACA!"
</p>
<p>
	BOOM
</p>
<p>
	As Dant and the Red Queen walked along the edge of the lava lake they couldn't help but notice a giant dragon falling from the sky which was really an enclosed cieling inside of an immense caldera.
</p>
<p>
	"FUCK SHIIIIIT FUUUUUCK" yelled Mutt the Goblin as he fell down into the lake of fire. As he reached out with the axe it bit into the rock and held him fast on the side of a great onyx mountain.
</p>
<p>
	"I...can't.....hold" He gritted his teeth. "Take....the....axe".
</p>
<p>
	Those were his last words as he fell into lava which is actually magma because it's underground as I established one paragraph ago so you can get off my case about it now.
</p>
<p>
	Dant held up the axe and examined it.
</p>
<p>
	"What the fuck was that all about" The Red Queen asked perplexed.
</p>
<p>
	BOOM
</p>
<p>
	And now the continuation of Daranos TNG.
</p>
<p>
	Princess Axewound yanked a golden chain which led to a golden and magically imbued collar around maybe the greatest guitarist of all time and definitely the coolest dragon of all time, Axl.
</p>
<p>
	Axl tried to breath a firebolt from his brutally trained vocal chords but could only manage a tiny puff of smoke. Much like what happens to your peener when you've jerked off for a fourth time today and basically your peener is crying out for help and maybe a power ade or at least like a hot bath. 
</p>
<p>
	"Now now litle dragon....play nice" Axewound said as she pulled on the chain wrenching Axl's girthy neck forward. "I'm taking you to get your shots" she said with a smile. Axewound wound her arm around air guitar style and said the magic incantation needed to make a portal.
</p>
<p>
	"Whaaaa widdely whaaaa" she said mouthing the guitar solo from Crazy Train. A golden portal opened. It's almost hypnotic churn did little to soothe Axl's churning stomachs. In his mind he could only think of that classic line from Star Wars; "I slaughtered them like animals. Not just the men but the women and the children too." That gave him a sense of calm as Axewound yoinked the chain through the portal and off they went.
</p>
<p>
	Glut peered into her quarters just as the portal zooped out of this reality.
</p>
<p>
	"She's gone!" he yelled as a dozen or more goblins charged into her room and started putting on her make up and trying on her dresses.
</p>
<p>
	"That color looks divine on you, Clut" Glut said while applying mascara to his one good eye.
</p>
<p>
	As they exited the portal Axl had to squint to see through the complete and utter redness of everthing. All around he saw ruins. The landscape was barren. More barren than your whore mother who has been cummed in so many times and only had you a child. Are you sure you're not adopted? Adopted by your cum loving whore mother? The Cum Queen?
</p>
<p>
	Anyway...
</p>
<p>
	"What the ass happened to this shit palace?" Axl asked looking around in awe.
</p>
<p>
	"Welcome to the FUTURE OOOooOoOOOO" Axewound said making space noises.
</p>
<p>
	"Looks metal as fuck" Axl said trying to sound nonplused.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah it's metal alright...." Axewound replied. They trekked across the desolation for hours. Apparently portalling into the future is like not an exact magical science. Or maybe Axewound was just doing it to march around her new toy. Like those little dog toys with the balls inside that go pop pop pop but you have to drag them and they aren't as fun as real dogs.
</p>
<p>
	Soon they reached an ancient looking black stone temple. There were no guards. There was no sign of anything alive at all. Axl was tired. His feet hurt but since he was metal as fuck he didn't complain. But he really could go for a cig right now. It's ok for dragons to smoke since they have smoke in their lungs all the time anyway. Don't smoke kids. Or do if you wanna look hella cool and impress that girl/boy you like. I'm not your mom do whatever you want.
</p>
<p>
	As they approached the enormous doors two golden automobots with tank threads for feet rolled out of little square cut outs in the wall. One grabbed the chain while the other offered to take Axewound's coat. They may be robits but they can still be gentlemen, dammit.
</p>
<p>
	"See..." Axewound turned her head around to look at Axl. "Told you it was...METAL" she giggled at her terrible joke more than anyone listening to this awful part of the show ever will.
</p>
<p>
	"This is worse than being dead" Axl replied dryly.
</p>
<p>
	Upon entering the massive stone enclosure Axl again had to squint to shield his cool dragon eyes. Sitting up on a throne was a huge red electrified sizzling red power orb of magic that was shooting bolts of red lightning off like a Tesla Coil from HECK. Automobots of all sorts were zooming around and fidgeting with various tools and crystals and meters. Inside the red orb was a husk of a creature looking to be long since dead just like the world around it.
</p>
<p>
	"My lord" Axewound said bowing low. Axl pretended not to look at her butt but he totally did.
</p>
<p>
	The being inside of the orb didn't respond. A single automobot used an ancient looking tablet of glass to raise the throne up inside of the orb. Axl squinted to make out just what the hell this creature was inside of this red ball. He could see an elongated head. A desicated veiny body. Half of the body was scarred and missing various parts that Axl, being a rockstar and not a doctor, thought were pretty important to the everyday functions of being alive.
</p>
<p>
	As Axl focused in on the face he could see one eye closed. The other having been eaten away by time or perhaps lost in some long ago ancient battle. Axl focused more on the remaning eye and BLINK.
</p>
<p>
	The eye opened. It was pure gold. No pupil. It looked straight through Axl and spoke into his brain. 
</p>
<p>
	"Welcome Dragon..." it said. Axl closed his eyes. Scared for the first time in his whole life. Even more scared when he had to cover for Stan Halen at Metalstock when he was high on Giggledirt and didn't remember the lines to MMMMMCL.
</p>
<p>
	The red orb rotated lowered down the floor. It zitted and spat out power as it touched the cold stones. Golden Automobots then hooked up these weird futuristic looking tubes to the magical orb. Another flipped a giant Frankenstein switch as molten gold filled the red orb. Axl winced remembering that part in the Hobbit when the dragon gets all that gold on him and how he wasted it by not snorting it all and getting gold high. Fuckin Freshman.
</p>
<p>
	The golden liquid drained and inside where once a decrepit ancient being lay was now a golden god of a humanoid. I mean this mother fucker had a 12 pack. He had Jared Leto hair and Betty Davis eyes. His completely nude body was awash in liquid gold. It was like standing in front of Josh Henderson when he was just out of the shower but somehow this beings GIANT PEENER was smaller than Josh Hendersons? I didn't even know that was possible. Me being the narrator and not Josh Henderson. I dont even know that guy. I hear he's got a huge dick though.
</p>
<p>
	Axl didn't even notice the sheer girthy hognaciousnous of this beings weenerdom as he was too focused on the gold, which never solidified. He could see the flecks of particulates of gold swirling in this beings form. He was transfixed as the being stepped forward dripping gold onto the ground which too never solidified. Like golden quicksilver. Which is mercury. Don't touch mercury if you dont want to be standing in the middle of grocery store aisles checking your smart phone or if you don't want your kids to cut all communication from you because you put a giant "Lets Go Brandon" flag in your front lawn that you paid 3000 dollars for. The house not the flag alhtough you could have been scammed out of 3000 dollars for the flag too considering you gave your life's savings away to a Pakistany guy all in Wal Mart gift cards. I don't even know how the fuck that scam is supposed to work but yet HERE WE ARE!
</p>
<p>
	"My lord" Axewound said getting back to the story. "I have found a worthy ally in our pursuit of...well whatever it is you're planning as I am just a humble peon in your service oh great golden lich!"
</p>
<p>
	The Golden Lich rolled his perfect eyes at such a half assed attempt at humility. 
</p>
<p>
	The Lich strode over to Axl completely unafraid. He stood now about 9 feet tall, but with seemingly no effort all grew in size to reach eye level with the dragon who was like...37 god damn feet tall. The Golden Lich ran a finger over the golden collar.
</p>
<p>
	"Quite an ingenious device if I do say so myself" He said. 
</p>
<p>
	"He's been....tamed" Axewound said with a wink at Axl.
</p>
<p>
	"He's been temporarily made IMPOTENT" replied the Lich. "But do you not see the rage in his eyes? He would kill everyone in this room given the chance. He would slaughter us all in a fire so hot it would melt the pillars of Hell it self." The Lich shuddered in pleasure.
</p>
<p>
	"What are you some kind of....Technomancer?" Axl asked through gritted teeth.
</p>
<p>
	"TSK TSK TSK" The Lich placed a finger over Axl's mouth. "Do you want to get sued by Rich Masters INC.? He's letigious as fuck! At the very least he'd fire us. And I sure as hell don't know how to convert Pounds into real money, do you dragon? Golden Lich will be fine. Or you're majesty or 'His BIggusness Biggus Dickus" the Lich said completely making no sense to anyone in this story.
</p>
<p>
	"I am ancient boy! Even to your long lived standards." The Lich said. "I have been here for as long as there has been a here. You think this realm is yours? All these little creatures scrambling around trying to survive in the dirt. This is not their world. It is mine."
</p>
<p>
	"So whats with the T-1000 cosplay then?" Axl said with a laugh. Axewound yanked the chain as if to scold a disobedient mutt.
</p>
<p>
	"Gold is the single most powerful substance to have ever existed." The Lich said.
</p>
<p>
	"Yea yea greed and blah blah blah" Axl replied.
</p>
<p>
	"No young one...." The lich sighed. "Every molecule of gold ever to exist in every realm where it is used has been....imprinted. Imprinted with what you ask?"
</p>
<p>
	"I didn't but sure" Axl said.
</p>
<p>
	"Imprinted with the hate and malice and the blood of the wars fought to obtrain it. Every single atom is cursed. You use it. You covet it and you don't even know it's esnalving you. What wouldn't you do for this yellow metal, hmmm. It never fades. It never tarnishes or rusts." The Lich waved his hands above him a red all see ball appeared. On it was Axl the night before the concert going absolutely buck nasty Gordon Gecko wild. The kind of shit I imagine Rich gets up to now that he's a big time business tycoon. Axl looked up and smiled.
</p>
<p>
	"HA yeah that was a good night" He said as the past him on the all see ball did a huge line of gold dust off of an orc's 5th middle dick.
</p>
<p>
	The Lich smiled and turned again to face Axl. He held out his hand as if he were grasping for something...something ethereal. He cocked his head and began to pull his hand back toward himself.
</p>
<p>
	"Dude if you want gold I can hook you up with....fuck....what the OUUUUUUUCHHH FUCK MAN" Axl screamed. The Lich smiled as millions of particles of gold began to rip their way out of Axl's dragon hyde, a substance that not even Josh Henderson's huge real dick on 8 blue pills could penetrate.
</p>
<p>
	The Lich breathed in heavily as all the gold sucked up into the being. THen he let out a sigh.
</p>
<p>
	"I dont need your...;hook up" the Lich said again waving his hand at the all see ball. Axl looked up panting. Above him was a giant river of gold flowing in what looked like a sewer. 
</p>
<p>
	"I have enough...."
</p>
<p>
	Axewound smiled. 
</p>
<p>
	"So what then?" Axl said regaining himself. He was drained. Like the Lich took more than just the dozens of kilos of gold dust he had schneefed the night before.
</p>
<p>
	"I need a more...hands on presence in Daranos" The Lich said. There are heroes there that could upset my golden applecart. On the all see ball Axl saw an image of a bearded white woman and a huge buff as fuck feline. He also saw a troll wielding a katana.
</p>
<p>
	"I have no idea who that is" Axl said.
</p>
<p>
	"Then killing them won't be a problem" Axewound interrupted.
</p>
<p>
	"Why would I do that?" Axl laughed.
</p>
<p>
	The Golden Lich simply turned around and snapped his finger. On the other side of hall a stone wall rose up to reveal another dragon....a female dragon.
</p>
<p>
	"G....Gertie!?" Axl said shocked. "But....she's....you're dead!?"
</p>
<p>
	"I can unmake what has been made and make what has been unmade" The Lich said. With another snap of his fingers the Lich shot red lightning at the other dragon.
</p>
<p>
	"No....its not her....she died....." Axl screamed.
</p>
<p>
	"AXL HELP ME" Gertie said. "I LOVE YOU AXL PLEASE"
</p>
<p>
	"This is a trick!" Axl yelled. The Lich stopped his magical attack long enough to shrink back down to his normal size. He reached behind his throne to grab a dragon sized Flying V. The very same that Axl had used like 2 stories ago or mabye it was last week I dont even remember.
</p>
<p>
	Axl shut his eyes and tried to keep the feelings at bay. The Lich began to play "When You Die Worms Eat Your Face" perfectly as red lightning shot out of the head stock of the guitar and struck the female dragon once again.
</p>
<p>
	"NO......NO!" Axl yelled.
</p>
<p>
	"AXL PLEASE" shouted Gertie.
</p>
<p>
	Axewound actually winced as she saw red lightning rip through the dragons hyde and splay golden blood all over the wall behind her. The bones of the dragon were layed bare where the magic was cutting through her. She screamed so loudly that the echoes could be heard throughout all time. Haunting this place in every instance of its existance.
</p>
<p>
	Axl snapped. All the years of schneefing giggledirt and gold dust finally peeled away like a hangnail on his brain. All the years of denying he ever loved Gertie all so he could just do the simplest of tasks and get through his day. He had buried her bones so deeply in his heart and mind that he forgot the sound of her. She was here now in pain. And it was killing Axl.
</p>
<p>
	He grabbed the collar and pried it off his neck. Axewound backed up in fear. Real fear she felt for the first time in a long time. Axl roared and fire shot up into the cieling of the hall. He bounced back down into the hall just like the screams of his wife echoes throughout the stones.
</p>
<p>
	Then he was off. He flew far.
</p>
<p>
	"Let him go" The Lich said simply hodling up one hand.
</p>
<p>
	1000 miles away Automobots were detaining suspsicious looking humans. One pulled out a spray can from a satchel of a teenage boy. On the wall behind him were the words "Gold Man Sucks DONGERS" with a cool S on DOngers and a human shaped falice drawn with veins and ball hair and everything.
</p>
<p>
	"You are to be sent to reconditioning" the automobot said.
</p>
<p>
	"Man suck my human flesh rod" the kid said as he spit right into the face of the bot as a little tiny windshield wiper came out of his face and wiped away the spittle.
</p>
<p>
	Across the way in what used to be a town square were protesters. One held up a sign "Justice for A-Frame!" and another said "A-Frame was A-Framed" and other one said "It's Been 1000 years I can't believe I still have to protest this shit".
</p>
<p>
	The auotomobots were way out of their league. Much like any human cop trying to de-escliate a volitile situation but maybe slightly better since the automobots actually rely on programming and not the programming they got from Fox and Friends or form Crazy Uncle Jimbo at Thanksgiving talking about "the border".
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly a loud roar was heard on the wind. The protestors looked up to see a dragon flying at like mach 40 breathing hot ass fire from its holes.
</p>
<p>
	"Welp this gonna suck" said one protestor. Axl then laid waste to the entire town's center. After it was over the ash from the burnt flesh fluttered down like gray snow. The automobots were unharmed as the fire did little to effect them. One picked up a bone from the ground.
</p>
<p>
	"If anyone finds a femur let me know. The Master was looking for a new femur. I'm going to put a bow on it so he knows its a gift from me....automobot #3570-36RJ8314"
</p>
<p>
	Axl landed with a howl. What had he done? He looked around at the massacre and the golden mindless robots sifting through the ashes. He saw one pluck out some gold teeth from a charred skull and deposite the teeth into a receptical in its chest cavity.
</p>
<p>
	"No that is an unla. Femur is the big leg bone that these fragile inferior beings use to bipedal their way around. It is highly innefilcient and much less cooler than tank threads or a single roller ball or even like bug legs or something cool" said automobot #3570-36RJ8314.
</p>
<p>
	Axl cried a single golden tear as another bot rushed over to pick up the solidified golden tear drop and deposit it into his chest cavity.
</p>
<p>
	And then Axl flew back to the Golden Lich.
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
