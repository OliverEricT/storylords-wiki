Tournaments and Cheese

Say Cheese & DIE

RICH RUINS MY FUCKIN TITLES FUCK YOU RICH

 The morning air was dryer than yo mama's vertical crotch mouth as the suns rose on the desolate wasteland that was Daranos. Gunk yawned and stretched his arms wide and smoothly held Axewound closer to him. Axewound was still sleeping but the dry air mixed with the stench of the trash pile they had boned on the night before wouldn't keep her asleep for long.

Sniff sniff"Oh GOD it smells like yo mama's veritcal crotch mouth after she used it to gargle the entire 1985 Bears Defense's jock straps after they were boiled in a giant looney tunes style pot for some reason...I don't know" Axewound gagged.

"Good morning my completely real girlfriend who is hot and who I didn't make up this time" Gunk said with a huge smile.

"Alright!" Axewound stood up completely buck ass wild naked as a not quite yet dead automobot let out a wolf whistle. "Lets get one thing straight Dwarf" She said as she put her hands on her totally breedable hips. Is that a compliment people like to hear? Write in to ToonHounds@gmail.com with your opinions. Just any opinions whatsoever.

"We ARE NOT 'boyfriend and girlfriend'" She said firmly almost gagging again but this time not from the stench but the phrase she just uttered. "If anything I am your Dommy Mommy Mistress Master who uses you for hot dwarf dick." 

"Isn't that pretty much the same thing?" Gunk said with a wink.

Axewound rolled her eyes. "ANYWAY" she began to say but she stumbled. She held her head and closed her eyes as she stumbled backwards.

Meanwhile up in a dead tree a skeletal mirkmonk burst out of his delapidated mirkmonk tree house and began to do the Arsenio Hall "Whoop" with his arm.

"DAAAAAMN BOY YOU TWO WERE FUCKIN GOIN AT IT LAST NIGHT" He said as he now was doing the suck it thing from wrestling. "You both are gonna have to take 2 birth control potions today because the way you were going at it I'm CERTAIN one or both of you are pregnant with octuplates. SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT. I'm pretty sure I should take some just from hearing you two humping like you was trying to repopulate the earf. Yup" the mirkmonk went on. "That sure is one loving boyfriend and girlfriend if I ever saw one. You make a cute boyfriend/girlfriend couple. If I had to put money on it I'd say you two were destined to be together forever, what with the insanely amount of 3ing you two did last night. It's like I always say 'The love you take is equal to the amount of 3 you make and then plaster all over your totally real girlfriends face and entire upper and lower body' The mirkmonk finished. Just then a bone eagle swooped down and pluched him from his tree.

"YOU BETTTER PUT A RING ON THAT BREEDABLE ASS BIIIIIIIITCH" he screamed as the bone eagle took him over the horizon.

"Heh I guess we did really go to town on each other last night..." Gunk said blushing.

"No YOU IDIOT" Axewound sighed. "If anyhthing our raucus earth shattering fuck sesh would have restored my energy, but I've been using magic in this realm like I put in the Konami Code and I had infinite ammo."

Gunk pretended to know what that meant and nodded as he touched his chin.

"If we don't...." Axewwound stumpled again. "If we don't get back to the master I'll be as useless as tits on a snakeman ever though Seth looks really good with those new scaly double H hangers"

"Alright" Gunk said with determination as he forcefully zipped up his fly. "We have to get you somewhere where at least you can recharge. Get some water....if we can find any" Gunk said looking around as his eyes met the gaze of a cattle's skull and it winked at him?

"Which...might be difficult" He conceded.

Axewound was now sweating a cold sweat. What the hell was going on with her? If anything the wild butt thrusting and peen juicing of last night should have given her a boost. But it didn't. She was now feeling more hung over than a soririty girl during slut week. She did siphon some of Gunk's energy right? She racked her brain. No...the only way she wouldn't have done that is if she....she let out an audilble gulp. If she ACTUALLY liked him. The thought made her wretch like a slut week freshman.

Gunk grabbed Axewound and held her up. She steadied herself and looked down at Gunk. 

"You....youuuuuuu..." She said sounding intoxicated. "Youuuuu arrrreee cuuuuuuuute" She said as she flicked his dwarf nose.

"Alright....hehe" Gunk said with a laugh. "Lets get you moving and maybe find you some uh...soemthing. Any idea which way we should be headed?"

"The fastest way between two points on a globe is.....TELEPORTATION BABY WOOOOOOOOOOOO" Axewound said as she flashed her boobs to nobody. "This guy knows what I'm talkin about" She said as she pointed to the same cows skull.

"Can you muster enough magical power to teleport us?" Gunk asked knowing the answer already.

"Can you muster enough magical shut up to teleport that dick into my mouth big boi...." She said stumbling forward again.

"Wow....normally this would be really funny and even kind of weirdly cute but I'm pretty sure we are going to die out here if we can't get somewhere that has civilization so...."

"SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHUUUUUT UUUUUUUPPPP" Axewound said listing from side to side. She then produced a single finger and drew the shape of a cock and balls complete with ball hair and all and began to mimic felating it while she pointed down at Gunk's junk.

"Okay lets go" Gunk said pulling on her arm.

Hours later they were still walking. Axewound was not getting any more coherent nor was she getting any less white girl drunk.

"21,000 dicks in my mouth 21,000 DICKS

Suck one down slosh it around 

20,999 dicks in my mouth" she sang as the suns were now setting.

Gunk set up a fire and laid Axewound down as she was now getting worse. She shivvered and was sweating perfusely. Even though the suns were down and the desert air was sure to get cold, it was not nearly cold enough for her to shivver. She began to mumble incoherently about your mother and how she watched said your mother gobble so many dicks that it quote "was like throwing a hot dog down hallway".

Gunk stayed up and began to carve a rudimentary spear out of a dead tree branch. He held the tip into the fire to harden it. As he did he felt Axewound's forehead. She was hot. Like not attractive hot but actually hot. She was also attractive hot too though if you didn't get that by now. Don't worry, when we start selling posters of her they will come with protective laminate coveryings and optional hole in the crotch for the really sick perverts who listen. So basically all of you.

Gunk was awoken by the hootin and hollerin that only a raiding party could muster. He stood up quickly and grabbed for his spear. As he did he saw dozens of boner cycles doing burnouts and wheelies and breakies in the desert sands encircling he and Axewound. Axewound was now passed the hard F out. She was dead to the world and to the totally dope showing of amazing boner cycle tricks going on around her. I mean, you'd have to pay money to see this type of shit in our world.

"GET BACK" Gunk yelled as he poked at a nearby boner cyclist. The spear peirced their side as they fell off the bike and howled in pain on the ground and then started doing sick break dance moves because these raiders were HIGH AS FUCK.

"GRAB THE HOT ONE!" yelled a raider in a mask

"You'll never take me!" Gunk said defiantly.

"I SAID 'GRAB THE HOT ONE' not 'GRAB THE SHORT IDIOT WITH AN INFLATED SENSE OF SELF CONFIDENCE" Clarified the raider.

Gunk, a little hurt by this, held his spear at the ready and stood over Axewound. She had rescued him from that weird witch and he wasn't going to let anything happen to his new totally real and totally hot girlfriend. Just then everything went blank and Gunk's head hit a rock on the ground. Above him stood a 7 foot tall ogre who was using an old parking meter as a club.

"heheehe he not so pretty now" the ogre said smiling.

As Gunk blinked his eyes open he saw the raiders cycling away with Axewound tied up on the back of the leader's bike. He reached out his metalic hand and tried to will himself awake but it was too late. The tunnel vision was setting in and soon everything was black.

Gunk awoke the next morning with nothing but sand and dust in his mouth. He spit out as much as he could along with several whole and partial teeth. He squinted and tried to focus on the red blood that hit the sand. "Wha.....what happ...." he said to himself. And then he remembered. 

"MY TOTALLY REAL GIRLFRIEND!" He shouted as he stood up. His spear was broken in half and the trail of the boner cycles was slowly being washed away by the winds of the wasteland. Gunk gathered up all he could and made his way in the direction he thought he remembered the caravan of misfits going.

He traveled for days only eating lizards and the bones of skeleton mirkmonks who probably were actually still sentient. Finally after the 3rd day he thought he heard thunder in the distance. He held his ear to the ground....

"Hmmmm" he said listening. "I have no idea what I'm doing..." But he pressed on in the general direction of the noise. Finally he reached an ancient and long abandoned sports field. All along the edges raiders had fortified the fence and added their flair. Skulls, spikes, flame spikes, flaming skulls, and cool S's covered the walls. Inside Gunk could hear the cheers of a thousand people. With one dope leap he used his strenght to straight up jump over the fence. Nothing would stop him.

As he walked through a tunnel onto the field he could hear the Humpty Dance blaring from All Speak Balls all around the stadium. On a throne near the end of the field he saw a one eyed cat man with raider armor and a steel warhammer. His grey fur glistened in the suns as he was fawned over by the crowd. In the crowd raiders were smashing kegs on their heads and pissing in corners and ball tapping each other.

"SIIIIIIILENCE" bellowed the cat man. "It appears we have a NEW CONTESTENT!" The Cat Man pointed the war hammer directling at Gunk as Gunk gulped.

"Perhaps he would like to participate in the GREATEST SPORTING TOURNAMENT IN THE WASTELAND?!" Shouted the Cat Leader. The crowd went nuts and at least 4 burly bitches flashed him. Some had like 6 god damn tiddies.

"Who the hell are you!?" Gunk shouted up to the cat man.

"I am Ken. Ken Thunderclaw. Leader of the Free Raiders Union #42069 and MC of this most sacred tournement." 

"You can speak Daranosian?" Gunk asked.

"Yes. And you, a dwarf appear to bathe regularly." Snapped Ken. "See I can be racist and insesitive too. Words have meaning Dwarf."

Just then 2 huge ogres wheeled out a cell on wheels with Axewound tied up jesus style. A single loin cloth covered her naughty bits and boobies like in those comics. 

"Axe" Gunk said under his breath. He clenched his metal fists.

"Tell them what our lucky winners will recieve, Bryce!" Ken said as he swooped a hand over toward a hobbit wearing tin cans as headphones and speaking into an all speak ball.

"Our winners this evening will recieve either this slightly used and road tied magical sorority hooker ORRRRRRR they'll recieve this lovely 3 quarter's of a cheese wheel that our lovely raiderse found in an old cellar!" The crowd went nuts at the sight of a cheese wheel that had substantial mold covering it and stink lines coming off of it. Gunk even swore he heard a foghorn sound effect when he looked at it.

"I'm IN!" Gunk shouted as the crowd went silent.

"Ahhhh I see the cheese has caught your eye." Ken said with a wink.

"I'M GONNA WIN THAT CHEESE AND EAT IT" shouted an Orc wearing a chain mail thong.

"The only stinky cheese you're gonna get is the stanky cheese of my fastball at the company picnic next weekend, Gordon" Shouted a troll.

"We all KNOW YOU BEEN JUICIN', QUINCY!!!" Gordon the Orc yelled back.

"I TOLD YOU I WASN'T INJECTING NOTHIN' INTO MY SCROTE. I was....I was....testing out my new penis pump....yeah thats waht I was doin...." Quincy made up on the spot.

"OUR FIRST COMEPITION" Ken Thunderclaw said interupting the stupidest argument ever had. "Is...BOBBING FOR BATPLES!" The crowd cheered as another group of orcs wheeled out large kegs full of live batples. Their wings frantically flapped as they tried to escape their watery prisons. Gunk could hear them screeching and scratching the sides of the wooden kegs. Gunk got in line as raiders tied each contestants hands behind their backs. Gunk had a distinct advantage since he was just at the right height to reach into the keg. But the thought of putting a live batple in his mouth was not one he relished. He had to make sure he didn't bite into one completely. There was no telling if even drinking some of this batple water would turn him into a chair. He had to try though. For Axe.

"123 GOOOOO" Ken shouted. The crowd cheered as each contestant shoved his or her head into the batlple infestested barrel. Gunk grabbed one ginergly withis is chompers and used his neck muscles to fling the batple out of the keg with a swift motion. He felt the water enter his mouth as he tried not to swallow. But after a second of not turning into a chair he figured it was safe.

His counterpart to his left wasn't so lucky though. A human female with only a handful of teeth couldn't resist biting into the juicy flesh of the batple as she immediateliy turned into a mid century hand made wooden rocker. She rocked back in forth with rage as she was disqualified. Gunk threw batple's 3 and 4 out of the keg when Ken blew the finish whistle.

"A FARTS I onliy got 4" Gunk said disappointed.

"Seeing as every other contestant is now a chair I name DWARF the winner!" Ken said with a flourish of his hammer.

The crowd booed as raiders brought in an old bone pick up and loaded the chairs on the back and sent them to the fire pit.

"OUR NEXT EVENT!" Ken shouted. "THE HOT DOG EATING CONTEST!" Again the crowd roared with joy. Some even started jerking off uncontrolably because they were not used to social situations and were not brought up right.

Once again raiders brought out tables full of....FINGERS?!?!? Gunk looked at the new competitors next to him and said "Uuhhhhhh these are fingers!"

"Yeah?" Quincy said giving him an incredulous look. "That's what Hot Dogs are, idiot!" he said as he scoffed and looked down at his pile of dismembered fingers.

"The trick is to swallow the bones whole" Gordon said licking his orc lips. Just the thought of the hot dogs was making him salivate. "Just like mah used to make" he said licking his fingers.

"READY SETTY AND GET GOING ALREADY" SHouted Ken as he blew a giant starting trombone.

One after one Gunk watched Quincy and Gordon consume the fingers of god knows who and god knows what. The blood spurted from their mouths as they ate their "hot dogs" like they had been starving themselves for days which they probably were since this place is fucked up all to shit.

Gunk grabbed a single finger and sniffed it. "Fuck this" he said dropping it. "I ain't eatin no finger. For all I know this finger was fingering someone's slutty ass mom last night" Gunk said looking directly into the camera.

"BETTER HURRY DWARF" Ken shouted over the cheers.

"I'll give you fingers..." Gunk said to himself. He then harnessed all his chi and made a karate chop hand with his new mechanical hands. He breathed in and out focusing his dwarven chi like Krillan does in DBZ. THen with a single CHOP he slammed his karate chop hand down onto Quincy's table severying all but one of his fingers on his right hand.

"GOOOOOOOOOAAAAHHH" QUincy shouted. "THATS MAH GOOD EATIN HAND" he cried as blood spurted forth in rythm to his hearts beats. "HOW'M I GONNA PITCH NEXT WEEKEND?!?!?!" He whined as he held his hand over toward Gordon spraying his face with blood.

"Guess I lose this one." Gunk said crossing his arms.

Ken frowned as he watched all of those precious fingers go to waste.

"Shame....but it looks like GORDON wins this one" Ken said as the crowd erupted for the hometown orc.

"Our FINAL competiton this evening is....THE GELATANOUS CUBE SACK RACE!" Ken air guitared on his hammer as the crowd was in a fervor.

Yet again raiders wheeled out what appeared to be dehydrated gelatanous cubes that had been stretched into a sack like shape. They wheezed and belched as dust flew out of their mouths? Their sack holes.

"We have dehydrated them so that they will only slowly consume your flesh and bodily fluids" Ken began to explain. "But if you do not reach the finish line they will have consumed enough of your fluids to rehydrate and then....." Ken motioned over to Brice the announcer who was not using a soundboard.

"UH OH...BOIIIINNG WOMP WOMP WOOMMP" Brice said with his soundboard.

Gunk slowly stuck one foot into a pink cube. It's insides were sticky but he didn't feel it burning his flesh. He held up his foot and saw that only a small bit of steam was coming off of his boot. Beside him Quincy  was holding onto the cube with his left hand as a blood soaked rag covered his pitching/eatin hand. Gordon was all the way to the right ready to go.

"TIME TO SACK UP BOYS" Ken said as he fired a flare into the sky which exploded into a pair of huge bright tits. With that they were off.

Gunk used his new found mechanical strength to will the cube forward faster than the others. But Gordon was on his tail. The Orc was strong and big. But that might be his weakness too, Gunk thought. More muscle equals more meat juice for the cube to ingest. Quincy was in dead last urging the cube forward by begging.

"C'MON CUBE BABY I NEED THIS" he cried. His blue cube merely belched and slumped over. Soon steam began to pour out of the cubes sack hole.

"No....NO NO NONO" QUincy shouted as he tried to leap out of the cubes mouth. As he pried his way out Quincy looked down to see that half of his body was now a skeleton. He wiggled his toes as they made a tiny xylophone sound as they twinkled in  motion.

"This fuckin blows' Quincy said as he laid down and died from massive blood and body loss.

Gordon was now right on Gunk's tail. Gunk looked back to see a lot of smoke pouring out of Gordon's sack cube. Gordon screamed as he pushed his cube forward. Gunk then felt the sizzle of hot firey acid hit his foot. The sensation intesified as it made its way up his ankle to his knees to his thighs. But it was too late. Gordon was not slowing down as only a pair of hands remained attached to a now full orc skeleton piloting the cube sack. Gordon's cube stopped and slithered back into itself fully rehydrated now as it let out a belch that spit out Gordon's skull.

'FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK" Gordon's skull said right before it too died forever probably I dont know I'm not a doctor.

Gunk crossed the finish line and immediately jumped out of the pink cubes mouth. He padded himself and made sure to check if his bits were still there. The crowd laughed as he jumped into a trough and sighed in relief. As he stood up everyone saw his twig and berries in full daylight as the cube had burned off all of his pantaloons.

"Looks like we have 3 suns out today" Ken said to the laughter of the crowd. "Well, it is my honor to offer you this....one whole three quarters of a cheese wheel we found in a cellar, dwarf" Ken said holding up the cheesey trophy.

"I don't think so" Gunk said now more confident than ever. He looked over to Axewound in the cage and used his new mechanical arms to great effect as he go go gadgeted his arms outward toward the cage. He pried the bars open and broke the lock on the door as he threw the cage at Ken Thunderclaw.

"This...THIS IS AN OUTRAGE" KEn said as the crowd began to boo.

"BRYCE!" Gunk shouted up toward the announcer. "HIT IT"

With that the hobbit put on Cum on Feel the Noise by Quiet Roit as Gunk staged a raider riot that was anything but quiet.

Gunk flung ogres and orcs and trolls and humies all over the place. With his bare hands he snapped the necks of the entire company softball team insuring that the game next weekeend was going to have to be postponed indefinitely.

One of the burly raider women sitting in the front row didn't even see Gunk coming as he grabbed teh bottom of her seat and closed the entire seat onto her body sandwiching herself into the seat. Her blood poured down the stairs as she slowly died. Her last words were "Totally. Fucking.......awesome" as she death rattled.

Finally, covered in the blood of hundreds of raiders, Gunk made his way up toward Ken's throne. His lungs were on fire. He panted in the hot suns. His lungs gasping for air as his heart pumped rage blood into every muscle in his body. Ken backed away slowly and held out his war hammer. 

"Tak...take it!" Ken stammered. "You're the captain now...."

Gunk grabbed the hammer with a clang of his metalic hand. And with that Ken was off and running.

"LATER SUCKERS GOTTA GET ME!" he shouted as he ran toward the horizon.

Gunk grabbed Axewound. Her limp body was cold but she was alive, barely. He grabbed the cheese wheel and slowly crumbled some of the disgusting solidified tit juice into her mouth. She slowly ate and began to come back to a normal....ish state.

"Heyyyyyyy cuttttie paaaaants" She said still sounding drunk.

"Hey drunky pants" Gunk laughed.

Axewound gasped as she saw the old hunk of cheese in Gunk's hand.

"DID YOU GET THIS FOR ME!??!" She squeeled in excitement.

"Yes...eat it so that you can not be annoying as fuck please" Gunk smiled.

"THank you.....boyfiend." Axewound said as she hogged down on moldy old cheese.

FIN
