Red Dead Antdemption II: Pt 2 Equalibrium

 Scrabbles Dant stumbled over a loose rock right as a red ant guard poked a spear hilt between his 2 left arms causing him to faulter and land hard on his knees.

"GET UP YOU 6 LEGGED FREAK" the guard snapped whapping the back of Scrabbles' head with the spear pole.

Scrabbles spit out a bit of green blood and looked stared the guard right in his compound eyes.

"You know you have 6 legs too or can't you count past 2" Dantonio snapped back in defense of his brother.

"I have 7 legs" the guard replied while doing the jerk off motion. "NOW GET MOVING SCHNELL SCHNELL"

As the two captive brothers made their way through the tunnels of the red ant colony they saw horror after horror. Men, women, and children were all being used as slave labor to mine gold. Scrabbles heard the distant yells and cries of those being punished for one reason or another. As the decended into the depths of the hive, they saw infected worker ants spewing up some form of viscous liquid all over the eggs of presumably young red ants. Scrabbles and Dantonio exchanged a knowing look and raised eyebrows. In another offshoot Scrabbles saw a group of red guards on break watching The Masked Bard on the all see ball.

"My god" he said under his breath. "We need to get the fuck out of here".

Finally the two brothers were deposited in a large room. The guards used their spear tips to not so gently encourage the 2 interlopers into the room where they promptly shut the door and locked it with a loud CACHUNK.

Scrabbles and Dantonio looked around fully expecting more guards to shuffled them up onto their feet once again to begin the march but...nothing. The room was eerily quiet. ALMOST OO EERILY QUIET. The brothers again gave each  other a knowing look. Scrabbles leaned on his left knee to peer around a large stack of boxes and other detritis strewn across the darkened room. He listened closely and heard the faintest of voices that almost sounded like a whispered echo. He concentrated using his super ant hearing. They have that. Don't look it up. It's a real thing! 

"Yes...yes mistress". Scrabbles could make out only a few words at a time.

"Get...Done OR ELSE" He heard a female voice say.

Scrabbles quietly rolled onto his side and began to do a stealthy worm dance.

"What are you DOING?!" Dantonio whispered trying hard to wriggle his wrists out of the ropes.

Scrabbles roll technique was perfect as he turned around the corner to see a giant all see image of a golden armored big titty witch. He almost popped a bone and ruined his worm moving ability but he thought about your sweet mama and kept that shit down. In fact the thought of your mom caused his peener to go fully inverted and instead of pre cum it just shot out a "please try again later" sign like a magic 8 ball.

"If you do not achieve the goal of full automotation by the double D moons..well...."the witchy woman trailed off and looked at her nails nonchalantly.

"You can imagine how angry the master will be...."

"Yes Mistress...We are close...I just need a little more time. Maybe if you could bring me some more slave..."

"SILENCE" The witch yelled closing her hand into a fist. A green aura of a hand was now wrapped around the man's throat choking him and not in a sexy way.

"I am not your partner nor I your friend. I do not do favors and I do not want to hear a single weak plea from your disgusting mouth hole again. Get it done or I'll make sure to squeeze every bit of meat juice and moisture from your body leaving you dryer than my whispering eye when I look at your muelling puss filled face!" she finished with a sigh almost like this was getting her excited. "Besides....you wouldn't want Sethy here to get ahold of you now would you...?"

In frame a giant snake made out of pure juiced up muscle appeared, slammed a keg of meade, and crushed it against his skull with one swift motion before letting out a burp so loud that somewhere a Mirkmunk woke up in the middle of the night and let out a faint "nice" before going back to sleep.

"I promise mistress axewound....I won't....I WILL get it done."

With that the image of the big titty lady disappeared. The man on the call turned around to Scrabbles mid worm. As their eyes met Scrabbles froze in mid slide just staying stock still on the tip of his peener hoping that maybe this guy had T Rex vision and could only see objects based on movement.

"Ah Mr. Dant" the man said lowering his hood. Underneath Scrabbles saw a deer faced druid complete with antlers and a monacle? Druids have those don't look that up either. Just add it to the wiki and be done with it.

Dantonion soon rounded the corner trying his best to stealth worm but coming out looking more like he was in a belly flop competition. With each aching and painful thrust of his peener region hitting the ground he simlpy said "Ow Ouch oW OUCHIE".

"And Mr. Dantonio Dant as well. Well today is my lucky day" Said the druid as he rubbed his hooves together menactingly.

Scrabbles used all the muscles in his 7th leg to kip up and right himself onto his feet. Dantonion on the other hand leaned against the series of crates and awkwardly found his feet again.

"HI YA" Dantonio said with a flourish clearly out of breath.

"You are probably wondering what you are doing here..." The druid went on. "First let me introduce myself I am"

"DOCTOR ANTLER WE GET IT" Dantonio finished his sentence for him.

"Oh so you've heard of me...das is serh gut" The doctor preened for a camera that wasn't there like an 11teen year old who's parents either hugged too little or not enough.

"What the farfegnugon do you want wiht us you ass munchin?" Scrabbles said firmly.

"You are here to be witness to a new age my young junges. A GUILDED age as it were" Dr. Antler tittered at his own joke. On the wall he threw a frankenstein-esque lever and gears behind the walls began to whir to life. As the entire wall began to rise like a curtain to a play Scrabbles and Dantonio saw the next abominable horror on this theatre of nightmares. On the stage were golden abominations. Nay. Golden mistakes of nature. Humuculi so deformed and distorted Scrabbles could barely make out anything that used to be organic and/or natural.

All around a thick golden haze seeped into Scrabbles and Dantonios lungs causing them to reflexively cough and squint their many eyes. In cages the humuculi jeered and cheered in an almost alien language. At least Scrabbles assumed it was language it could have been the moans of dispair or even the death rattle as everything natural and whole died in these beings right in front of Scrabbles. Dantonio turned and puked.

"Now my young antling friends..." Dr Antler said through an elaborate plague bearer mask that Scrabbles didn't even notice he had put on such was his terror and disgust.

"...Now you will help me achieve my master work!" Anter began to laugh manaically as 2 golden twisted ant men dragged Scrabbles and Dantonio to a nearby cage and threw them in with the strength of 10 antmen which equates to like 5 million regular men. To scale of course.

Dr. Antler laughed and turned back to his work. Scrabbles struggled to see through the haze as he heard Antler's mask tubes pump in fresh air. He tried to follow the tubing to a source where the air was surely being pumped in but lost it near a wall. The fog was simlpy too thick just like my TRGW or so says many real people who are definitely real but you can't talk to them because they live in Canada and are probably doing a model shoot right about now. (Looks at watch) Yeah for sure doing a shoot or maybe an interview for that famous magazine people like. ANYWAY.

Scrabbles sat down with a thud as the gaseous form of this golden haze began to make him short on breath.

(Sad Trombone Noise). Said a humunculi from the next cell. Through his squinted eyes Scrabbles looked through the cage and saw the most horribly deformed being he had ever seen and he has seen your aformentioned mama. Twice!

In the next cell was a golden atrocity that violated every natural law of beauty and nature. A mans body with gold melted into its skin in patches along with his right arm fused together with a trombone and the trombone was his entire face and head.

"Sweet John PHillips SOUSAPHONE!" Scrabbles exclaimed and almost jumped back.

"(Sexy trombome noise)" said the monstrosity as it waved its left hand in greeting.

"Dude...." Dantonio said as he again wretched in the corner. He was not looking good. The golden maisma was having a worse effect on him than it was his brother.

"Hello...." Scrabbles said at first holding out a hand to shake then thinking better of it. "I'm Scrabbles and this is my brother Dantonio...."

"(Slided up Trombone noise)" he said.

"Your name's...Sackbutt?" Scrabbles could somehow understand this. Maybe it was the miasma or maybe it was just convenient for the story. WHO KNOWS!

"(Dr. Antler sings the birhtday song)"

"Scrab....I...I can't.....cough cough" Dantonio was not sweating profusely and looked as pale as my white innocent butt.

"We need to leave..." Scrabbles said as he knelt down to wipe the sweat from his brothers mandibles. Scrabbles thought quickly and stood up. On the other side of the lab he could see 2 golden antbominations doing guard stuff.

"HEY HEY YOU GOLDILOCKS!" Scrabbles shouted. "Bring your non ferous thorax over here! YEAH YOU GOLDFINGERED!"

The antbominations looked at each other and robotically on que started to march in perfect unicen toward the cage. WIth a swift CHUNK they lowered their spears perfectly in syncronicity.

"I bet you polish that golden aedeagus 'bout 4...5 times a day!" Scrabbles goaded. One of the guards raised his spear and struck downward toward Scrabbles but was met with a CLANG! Scrabbles had caught the spear mid thrust. He looked at the antbomination and winked..."

"Oh you fucked up now...." Scrabbles said ripping the spear out of the guards metalic arms. The other guard moved to skewer Scrabbles with his spear but Scrabbles parried the blow and held the second spear against the cage's bars with the first spear. He then thrust the first spear through the guard's face. It zitted and whirred as a golden liquid shot out from all directions. Now armed with 2 spears Scrabbles quickly dispatched the second guard.

Dr. Antler was still immersed in song and was wearing all see phones on his ears. He heard nothing as the guards gurgled golden viscous blork out of their faces and were put down. Scrabbles then used one spear to pry open the cage door and gathered his brother to his feet. Sackbutt was tooting excitedely as he "looked" at Scrabbles through his own cage's bars. Though he had no face and no eyes and no mouth and just a trombone for a head Scrabbles couldn't help but feel like the creature was giving him puppy dog eyes.

"Fine lets go Bone Boy" He said busting Sackbutt's cage door open. Finally, probably because the all see pod was switching songs, Dr. Antler turned around and gave out a long doc brown style gasp that was muffled by his breather.

"Hey...Herr Cocktor! Suck spear!" Scrabbles said as he javelined a spear towards Dr. Antler's breathing tube. It easily ripped through the canvas as golden haze began to suck through the piping causing Dr. Antler to cough and gag immediatly.

"NIEN!" he yelled as he struggled to reach an alarm rope. Dantonio stumbled against a table but managed to grab a sack of rotten potatoes that were being stored for the prisoners. He fumbled his way over to the pipe and shoved the whole sack into the tubing cutting off ALL air from the Doctor. Anter coughed and choked.

"ZEE OLD KARTOFLE IN ZE TAIL PIPE TRICK!" He choked as he managed to pull the alarm rope just as he passed out.

Scrabbles squinted and coughed his way through the smog to find the aperature which the breating tube was connected. It was just big enough for them to shimmy down.

"DANTONIO" Scrabbles yelled as his brother and Sackbutt felt their way over to Scrabbles.

Scrabbles ripped the tube off the wall and saw an almost organic pink meaty membrane pumping air up and out. Like an epiglotis from hell. Scrabbles sighed in disgust at what looked like a fleshlite modeled after your whore mother on account of it being so large and looking like a hand grenade blew up inside of a roast beef hoagie. Dantonio fell into the mucousy hole. It was like throwing a hotdog down a hallway.

"Into the mucus shoot, Bone Boy" Scrabbles said throwing Sackbutt down the hole.

They slorped and slid down this organic mechanism like Napoleon down a waterslide. when they reached the bottom they were in a molten cavern, hot and full of workers toiling away. A whistle blew and Scrabbles grabbed his brother, carrying him mostly through the crowds of slaves. They cheered as they passed and began to try and stop the now dozens of guards from catching up to the Ant Boys and their Brassy friend.

"Scrab....I'm...I'm not gonna make it....." Dantonio said completely drained. Scrabbles looked down at his brother and saw his eyes now glowed yellow. He was jaundiced and patches of gold began to spike through his carapace. Dantonio pushed Scrabbles and stood on his own two feet.

"STOP!" he yelled.

"Danto this is no time we have to move" Scrabbles pleaded with ihs brother. They had reached a lava bridge. A thin bridge which stood over a roaring river of molten death. Dantonio grabbed the spears from Scrabbles and pushed him onto the mouth of the bridge.

"GO!" He yelled. Sackbutt turned his horn head in confusiion.

"I'll...hold them off...." he panted and used the spear as a crutch for a moment. "GO!"

Scrabbles hesitated. Whatever was eating his brother form the inside was killing him. Maybe it was making him say this too. Making him go back to his captors and creators. But Sackbutt seemed fine with running. Maybe this affliction was making Dantonio brave. Brave enough to face his death. Brave enough to do what Scrabbles tried to do for him. To protect his brother. To save him. To keep him safe.

"GO NOW!" Dantonio yelled as he swung both axes at the charred ropes fo the bridge. It began to buckle and unravel. Scrabbles stumbled and grabbed onto the already deteriorating rope railing. Sackbutt joined him. Dantonio gave his brother one last smirk and turned to face his destiny. Scrabbles was in shock. He didn't know how he got to the other side of that bridge. He didn't remember willing his legs to move his body the 100 yards to safety. He doen't remember turning back one last time to see his brother dual weilding spears and knocking guards into the lava lake below. He didn't know how long he stood and watched his brother heroically sacrifice himself as the guards finally overwhelmed him. And he didn't remember when the tears started to fall from his eyes as he brother's body fell into the river of hell below.

"(Sad trombone noise)" said Sackbutt. This snapped Scrabbles out of his shock but only long enough to see a blazing blue arrow fly across the river of fire and strike Sackbutt right in the chest. Scrabbles gasped. Sackbutt turned his horn to face Scrabbles. Scrabbles held out his hands as if to say "what do I do now?" as he looked at Sackbutt.

Scrabbles followed the arrows path back across the river and saw the 2 golden antomitons he thought he had killed in the lab, a spear still sticking out of the face of one of them. Scrabbles instictively grabbed the arrow and wrenched it from the chest of this weird trombone boy. As he pulled it out it glowed a magical blue and pulsed like the heart it had just pierced. Sackbutt fell. Scrabbles watched as his awkard body tumbled down into the lake of fire.

"(Trombone verion of taps") Sackbutt played as his body sunk beneath the molten rock. With his left hand he held up a thumbs up as it too slid beneath the fire. Scrabbles was alone. He turned to gaze at his brothers killers as arrows and spears were loosed all around him. He stood defiantly against this barrage almost as if his grief were a suit of armor that wouldn't allow him too to die for that would be a kindness at this point. He turned into a dark cavern and fell. He fell down into a black pit. 

Sliding on the skree and rocks he slowed down enough to gently lay in a dark cavern.

After several hours he awoke to the sound of chittering in the darkness. Shit they had found him. He tried to get to his feet but his leg was fractured. He yelled out in pain quickly silencing himself and scolding himself for giving away his position.

CHITTER CHITTER CHITTER.

He covered his mouth to stifle to the pain and agony. Then in the darkness beyond he saw two red gleaming eyes. Towering above him. This was it. He closed his eyes and readied himself to meet his brother in the antferlife.

"Are....are you hurt?" a gentle female voice asked. Scrabbles opened his eyes slowly.

Out of the darkness an emaciated yet comely ant queen skulked out. She chittered slowly over to Scrabbles. She was tall. Like 8 feet tall and had a HUGE thorax. Sir Mix A Lot the famous Knight who slayed a thousand booties would surely have jumped onto Hoopty, his knightly steed, to get a glimpse at this back meat. Even white orcs got to shout. 

Scrabbles reflexively pushed himself back away from her though. She stopped and held out a hand. In one of her other many hands she held a rag.

"I...I can help..." She said calmly. Scrabbles saw that she was sick. Or she was hungry. He could sense that she was scared too. 

"Come...." She gestured for Scrabbles' hand. "I have a place we can let you rest....come come"

Scrabbles reluctantly took her hand. What choice did he have? This could be a trap. Surely this was a trap. But again what choice did he have.

They slowly limped into the darkness.
