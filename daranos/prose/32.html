</p>
<p>
	 "AHHHH FUCK AHHHHH SHIT OUCH MY NECK AAHHHH SHIT FUCK MEEEEE FUCKIN SHIT AHHHHHHHHHAHHH FUCK.....AH.......shit.......fuuuck.....shitfuck" Screamed Seth the Serpant as he fell into a magical portal like the one in Stargate. The movie not the show. Not that I have anything against the show but I haven't seen it. I know. Get off my dick about it ALRIGHT. I'll get around to it. Jesus.
</p>
<p>
	He had been falling for what felt like 8 years and if it was as if he himself didn't know himself anymore. He felt soulless and empty. Almost like he wasn't what he used to be. Or like he lets say, had been fired from life.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly with a thoomp he found himself inside of....A CASINO? 
</p>
<p>
	"WELCOME WELCOME NEWCOMER" a booming voice dripping with sex and confidence shouted over the crowd of gamblers.
</p>
<p>
	"What...what the fuck is this shit?" Seth asked slithering up on his feet? Like you konw when like cobras do that thing where they rear up? Is that feet? It's feet now. Seth looked around and saw any number of uncomely and rancid dicked nerdowellers. There was an Orc Barbarian who had a half of a turkey sticking out of his throat. There was a gnome who was smashed up real flat and when he smiled he had piano keys for teeth. There was even a guy who was just legs walking around oh wait no...there's his other half. It's by the bar. He's drinking somehow. Where is the drink going? ANyway!
</p>
<p>
	Seth looked up to where that sexy dick hardening voice had come from earlier to see a golden goddes sitting on a crystal red throne. In her hand was a staff and by her side were like 50 hot nude people just being benches and fan boys and some more bench guys. A lot of them were just benches. She wore a golden armored bikini that showed just the right amount of underboob. He grey white skin sparkled like she was the main attraction at the club on a tuesday night. Her lips were blood red and her eyes were as dark as her long raven hair. She sneered and nodded politely.
</p>
<p>
	"I am QUEEN Axewound" the hot dame said with power. At this the entire casino shouted "HAIL AXEWOUND" and Seth jumped with a startle. 
</p>
<p>
	"Welcome to HECK" She yelled and then laughed like a crazy ex who just saw you get your dick punched in by a dude at the bar because you thought he was your friend Sean but he was not your friend Sean. ANYWAY.
</p>
<p>
	"uhhhh I don't mean to critisize your hotness, but don't you mean Hell?" Seth asked trying to sound innocently ignorant.
</p>
<p>
	"PFFFFT pish posh" Axewound responded. She rose up out of her throne and floated over to the casino floor where Seth was standing. The crowd of patrons instictively moved out the way as her dainting size 6 horned heels gently touched down on the carpet.
</p>
<p>
	"This is for sure not H E double toothpicks" Axewound said as she gently placed an arm around Seth's shoulder? His shoulder area. "Tell me Snake man...what do you remember before this?" She queried.
</p>
<p>
	"Uhhhh" Seth thought hard rubbing his chin with his tail tip. "Nothing....I mean....I think I died....but I dont even really remember my name. It's as if....my history has been forgotten or like that the author of my life wrote me 8 years ago and totally forget any details of my life. Like I was just just throw away character in a short story for the amusement of the lords above.....I dont even remember my name.....If only we had a wiki" Seth finished while looking at the camera.
</p>
<p>
	"Exactly" Axewound said now moving them over toward an empty table. "And that is why I, the great liberator of inhabitions and Queen of the Necromancy-ers, Axewound, have brought you here to my new realm. Heck. It's not as bad as hell and there are literally ZERO downsides to being here. There's a party all the time!"
</p>
<p>
	With that the patrons again as if on que shouted "HAIL AXEWOUND".
</p>
<p>
	"Tell me snake man. Did you ever dream of being....more?" Axewound probed.
</p>
<p>
	"I once had a dream I had arms and legs and was running away from somebody but I couldn't run fast enough so I started using my arms to pull myself along while running but even that wasn't fast enough" Seth said.
</p>
<p>
	"Not at all what I meant" Axewoudn snapped her fingers and pointed to the table. Instantly a set of Tarot cards appeared with a crystal ball.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh god a Tarot reading....this really is Hell" Seth said.
</p>
<p>
	"This is just an illusion as to make you...more comfortable with the amount of probing I'm going to be doing. Think of it as a metaphor for me rummaging around in your brain and pulling things out without getting like brain juice and blork all over my nice table" Axewound sat down at the one side of the table.
</p>
<p>
	"Sit sit" She said padding the table top. Seth sat down as his little snake body coiled around itself. Axewound cracked her knuckles and feigned concetration as she pulled the first card.
</p>
<p>
	"OOooo the death card" She said holding up a card with a rat with a gun pointed outward placing it on the table.
</p>
<p>
	"So I AM dead!" Seth let out in a combination of panic and acceptance.
</p>
<p>
	"Not necessarily" Axewound said. "It's more of a transition card...like a rebirth" With that she drew another card.
</p>
<p>
	"Ahhh the Horny Halfling card" She said  holding up a card with a little guy using a glory hole in an outhouse."Again...a rebrith is in your future"
</p>
<p>
	"Wait how is that...."
</p>
<p>
	"Shush shush shush" she shooshed Seth drawing another card. "Oh no the Rebirth card" She held out a card with snake eating its own tail and winking?
</p>
<p>
	"Let me guess....another transition or rebirth" Seth said.
</p>
<p>
	"No no this card is actaully really bad and means you are probably going to die very painfully and meaninglessly probably sucking your own tail off like the little nasty whoroboros that you are."Axewound finished placing down the card.
</p>
<p>
	"BUT" she went on "That brings us to why you are here today. I have a proposition for you"
</p>
<p>
	"Do I have a choice?" Seth asked wincing ready for the Queen to smite him.
</p>
<p>
	"HAHAHAH" She cackled. "Of course you do! This isn't Hell. I told you. In this realm everyone is free to be themselves and do what they wish. There is LITERALLY no downside to being here."
</p>
<p>
	"Soooooo why bring me here?" Seth asked.
</p>
<p>
	"As a former villain of the realm of Daranos I am empowered to pool you all together and have a sort of 'tryout' for my new crew of evil minions. As such if you win you will be giving new powers, full use of Heck's in house gym, a really sweet stock option portfolio, health insurance, Thong Thursdays, Pizza Fridays, and Mutilation Mondays as well as your own company bonercycle. How does that sound eh?"
</p>
<p>
	Seth sat perplexed. He had never been giving a real job before and this Queen was really laying it on thick. There had to be a catch. 
</p>
<p>
	"There has to be a catch..."he finally asked suspicion dripping from his lips.
</p>
<p>
	"Like I said ther is no downside. If you don't win you are free to chill out here and play the games and have all the weird sex you want until I call upon you to be cannon fodder for the forthcoming revolution and be a pawn in my greater schemes to rule a destroyed Daranos...." She finished quietly under her breath. 
</p>
<p>
	"Look what were you doing prior to this?" She asked standing up and again putting  an arm around Seth's shoulder area.  "You were probably doing some stupild shit in a cave or something and some adventurer killed you because you were trying to trick them or something dumb am I right?"
</p>
<p>
	"That sounds....vaguely familiar yes" Seth said thinking hard. If only he had that wiki.
</p>
<p>
	"So you're in?" Axwound asked looking down into Seth's eyes.
</p>
<p>
	WIth a sigh he finally relented. "I GUESS I mean what do I have to lose right?"
</p>
<p>
	"That's my snake boy" Axewound said as she snapped her fingers. Suddenly the entire casino went dark with only a white hot spotlight lighting up the middle of the darkened room. In the center was a poker table where 3 other gladiators were seated. It was if suddenly Seth fell asleep watching Comedy Central and then woke up in the middle of the night and for some reason they are playing a poker competition? At least he didn't fall asleep to a DVD and have listen to the DVD menu screen over and over and over again.
</p>
<p>
	"Why....why poker?" Seth questioned as Axewound floated over the dealers spot suddenly wearing one of those little green visors and those little fluffy garter things on her arms.
</p>
<p>
	"Poker is the ultimate douche game." She said matter of factly. "Only a true villain can win using his brains and cunning. Plus, every idiot in the realm thinks they're good at poker. You get a bunch of bros together and bring up poker and I guarentee every single one of them thinks they can beat one another so in that way nobody thinks they're being cheated. Plus if I had you fight with swords or magic I'm pretty sure you'd last about as long as you would if you could suck your own tail, you little naught tail sucking O-face-phidian you." She said with a wink.
</p>
<p>
	"Uhhhh how am I supposed to hold the cards?" Seth asked waving his tail.
</p>
<p>
	"Do'nt worry about it. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND BEINGS OF UNIMAGINABLE HORROR!" Axewound shouted as an all talk stone lowered down from the ceiling on a cable.
</p>
<p>
	"Please welcome our contestants for this edtion of 'WHO WANTS TO BE A MINIONAIRE". The crowd roared in applause and cheer. Seth squinted to see through the hot lights to the crowd but coudln't see anything.
</p>
<p>
	"Our first contestant, from parts unknown and weighing 69 stone, please welcome TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG" With this a bright spotlight shown on a gigantic shirtless orc. His muscles were so huge he made Hulk Hogan look like Hogan's Heros. In both nipples he had peircings with he skulls of emenies he had slaughtered. His one eye was gouged out and in its place was another skull of another enemy he had slew. His top knot was held up high with a scrunchy made with, you guess it, the skulls of enemies he had slaughtered.
</p>
<p>
	"Give Tog card" he said as he smashed his monstrous meat hook down onto the table.
</p>
<p>
	"Up next, from the far east weighing 190 Freedom Units, we have SANJI MUSASHI famed swordmaster and notorious warrior!" The crowd again went nuts.
</p>
<p>
	"Hello, I am Sani. I am ready to play cards. I am speaking in a normal voice with no affectation since even though we are in Heck it does not mean we have to resort to such problematic impersonations"
</p>
<p>
	"WOOO" shouted one person from the crowd.
</p>
<p>
	"Next up we have the terror of the southern regions. The most RACIST man to ever live in Daranos.....HONKEY TONK TOM!!!!" The crowd went nuts with this one. This guy was their clear favorite.
</p>
<p>
	"YEEE HAW PEW PEW PEW" Said a man wearing an over the top Elvis like outfit. On his head was a cowboy hat with a Paladin Lives Matter bumper sticker on it for some reason as if thats something people did. He was chawing on a massive wad of chewing tobacco and spit out a large greasy wad of blork. It made a TING sound as it hit the ground.
</p>
<p>
	"Hey yall wanna know who REALLY did Stein 11?" Honkey Tonk Tom asked as the crowd quieted...He grabbed the all talk stone from Axewound, leaned in and in a hushed voice said "Orcbama". With this the crowd went NUTS. THey loved this racist fuck. Seth felt unease wash over him.
</p>
<p>
	"AND FINALLY our last contestant....a snake man who I literally just met like 20 minutes ago weighing like 3 grams its SETH THE SNAKEMAN" Axewound said to the absolute silence of the crowd. Only one person let out an awkward cough before another person let out a firm and consistant "BOOOOOOO"
</p>
<p>
	Axewound used her magiks to shuffled the deck of cards as a naked slave man got on all fours and became, you guessed it, a bench for her to sit on. With ease she threw out cards to each player as each player in turn picked up their cards and looked at them making sure to keep them secret and keep them safe.
</p>
<p>
	Seth looked around confused until Axewound got his attettion with a sublte "psst". She deftlyh pointed downward to indicate he should use his tail. As Seth moved his tail he saw it was covered in scotch tape. He looked at Axewound thankfully as she gave him a smile and wink.
</p>
<p>
	"GIVE BETTER CARDS" Tog shouted as he slammed down his cards.
</p>
<p>
	"Now Toggy you can either start betting or you can fold" Axewound said gently.
</p>
<p>
	"GIVE BETTER CARDS!" Tog shouted again then crossed his bulky massive python arms like a child and pouted as he quietly began to cry.
</p>
<p>
	"Ok so Tog folds. You're next Seth" Axewound directed.
</p>
<p>
	"Uhhhhhh...." Taped to Seth's tail were two cards that Seth was pretty sure weren't real cards he had ever heard of. "The 7 of Blue Moons and the 2 of Dissapointements?" He thought to himself. "I bet 5" he said as he pushed a little gold chip into the center of the table.
</p>
<p>
	Honkey Tonk Tom was next. He quietly studied his cards and licked his tabacco slicked lips deviously as he side eyed everone else.
</p>
<p>
	"Yall wanna know what really happened at GEMGAZI" he said quietly with a sneer. "Killery Clinton and her husband Bilbo Clinton were in on the WHOLE THING but the god damn Liberal Madia Goes to Jail doesn't want you to know about it." he said completely out of nowhere. Wait oh. I'm getting a note from my editor. Killery is a realy thing real racists call Hilary Clinton? That's...a real thing huh. Well can we still go with Biblo Clinton? Yeah I think that'll kill. Ok good.
</p>
<p>
	"What a complety rational and not at all insane thing to bring up out of nowhere for no reason" Sanji said at his foe's totally out of pocket ramblings.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh yeah?" Tom said confrontationally. "Where were you on January 69th?" He sad as he jabbed a finger into Sanji's armor.
</p>
<p>
	"Work. I was at work" Sanji said calmly.
</p>
<p>
	"CALL" Tom said as he pushed in a chip. Sanji also called as he pushed in his own chip.
</p>
<p>
	Effortlessly Axewound drew 4 more cards. "The 2 of Parental Shame, the King of Queens, the 2 of Perfect Strangers, and the Ace of Base" Axewound said. "Hmmmm interesting".
</p>
<p>
	After another round of bets Axewound drew the final card. "The King of Wishful Thinking"
</p>
<p>
	Each player laid down their hands. 
</p>
<p>
	"SETH WINS WITH A FULL HOUSE" AXEWOUND SHOUTED.
</p>
<p>
	"BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" said that one guy from the audience.
</p>
<p>
	"And with that two of our contestants with the worst hands are out. Sanji...Tog...it was nice knowing you" Axewound said as she pointed at each. Suddenly Tog began to choke and froth at the mouth. Deep within his muscular body his massive bones began to crack and splinter as vomit and froth spewed from his mouth and out of his nose like when people do tha tthing with coke and mentos. The froth soon turned red and viscous as every organ in his body was now being vomitted up one by one in the most excrutiatingly painful death anyone had ever seen. When he vomited up his own large intestine the blood turned a dark brown because he now too was vomitting up his own shit. Everyone in the audience roared with laughter and cheered this display of sheer manaical sadism as Axewound did that head wobble Bill Cosby thing that he used to do. This was true nightmare fuel Seth thought as he leaned away from the spray of blood, guts, and feces that now covered the poker table and all the chips and cards. But this wasn't the end. Next Sanji began to pull at his collar.
</p>
<p>
	"It is hot in here or is it me?" he said innocently as literal steam began to whistle like a kettle from his metalic samurai armor. Axewound gave a fake sarcastic frown as she looked over to him. As his eyes met hers everything went blurry as his eyes themselves began to melt out of his skull. He screamed in agony as his armor glowed redhot as he began to be cooked alive inside of his own armor. The smell of burning hair and pork filled the room as Seth even had to admit it smelled pretty good. His senses were again brought back to reality as he saw a man literally being cooked alive in his seat. Sanji's skin melted off of his face like hot cheese off of a pizza box lid. He went to grab his katana to end his own life but as he griped the handle his forearm bones snapped off in place leaving his hand still gripping his weapon. He instinctively tried to look at his own hand only to rembmer his eyes were now sticky gelatin on the floor. And with that both men dissappeared.
</p>
<p>
	"WHAT THE ACTUAAL FUCK WAS THAT?" Seth screamed in fear.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh...don't be so dramatic they're fine" Axewound said pointing over to the bar.
</p>
<p>
	"Hi" Sanji said quietly as he waved holding a tropical drink
</p>
<p>
	"ME HAVE DRINK" Tog said as he pointed to his drink with a little umbrella.
</p>
<p>
	"That just leaves Racist Tom and Seth" Axewound said as she shuffled more cards still covered in the horror of what just happened. Pieces of Tog sprayed and slorped around as they hit Axewounds face. She shuffled away ignoring the horror.
</p>
<p>
	HOnkey Tonk Tom again spit out a wad of spittle and again a TING sound followed.
</p>
<p>
	"How are you even making that sound?" Seth questioned.
</p>
<p>
	"The whole worlds my spittoon boy" he said eyeing up the snake man. "Say you a snake feller right?"
</p>
<p>
	"Yes obviously" Seth replied.
</p>
<p>
	"Never did like them snake fellers" Tom said giving a side eye. "I say we build slightly inconvenient 3 foot tall wall on the borders to keep yall out. Slitherin around on our ground without payin no dirt taxes using up all our sunlight to keep your cold blood warm no leg having long bodied green skinned shoulda made boots out of ya but the god dang Liberal Madia's Big Happy Family won't blame the real problems on all the snakes" Tom went on as Axewound had already given out new cards. "I say we put ya in a poster tube and ship ya back to SAND LAND WHERE YA ALL BELONG" he finally finished.
</p>
<p>
	Seth looked at his new cards. The Carribean Queen and the Jack of Offs". Again Axewound dealt out four cards of her own: The Burger Queen, The Jack of Reachers, Queen Latifah, and finally Queen's Gambit on Netflix starring Anya Taylor Joy. Each player again called. Axewound again drew the final card: Jack Starring Robin Williams where he plays a child but he's in a guys body like a reverse Benjamin Button but Diane Lane is in it. I'd do terrible things for her to be my mommy for a day. I'd even Watch Jack Starring Robin WIlliams.
</p>
<p>
	After a brief raise from each player they lay their cards out. Again Seth's beginners luck won true as Honkey Tonk Tom actually had gotten rid of all of his black cards because well....he was nothing if not on brand.
</p>
<p>
	"Awww sorry Tom but it looks like Seth IS OUR WINNER" Axewound shouted. This time the crowd finally got into it cheering and yelping. Maybe not for Seth but for the fact they they were going to witenss another disintigration or mauling or acid falling form the ceiling or maybe like a monster was gonna go up Tom's pee hole or something horrific. But that never came as Axewound simply snapped her long sexy fingers and POOF. Tom vanished.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh ok well alright" Seth said.
</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile in an ordinary room in an ordinary looking home Honkey Tonk Tom zooped into being. He tried to move his arms and legs but to no avail. He was strapped to a chair. On the all see ball in front of him was D-SPAN, Daranos's channel for watching boring goverment things. As he focused in he realized he was watching the Daranosian Senate ratify bill after bill where peoples of color or different sexualities and sexual preferences got inalienable rights and protections from the governement. He watched as the Paladins of Daranos were disbanded and replaced with actual professionals who actually helped people instead of being a militant arm of a rich white autocracy of corpo fascistic capitalistic slave drivers. And then Boo 2: A Madia Halloween was shown non stop  for 69 straight years. 
</p>
<p>
	Axewound snapped her fingers again and the casino schtick disappeared completely. Now all around were people in red robes standing vigil next to a river of blood. 
</p>
<p>
	"Kind of like my wedding amirite guys" Seth said awkwardly to nobody as again that one guy did that awkward single cough.
</p>
<p>
	"Seth...it is time for you to ASCEND" Axewound said as she again was on her crystal throne. Below her on a dias was a table with straps and all kinds of potions and needles and doctor stuff that I hate.
</p>
<p>
	Seth slithered slowly up to the dias as the red robed minions began to chant in a crazy langauge that would make your nana give you one of those little bibles for christamas thats only the new testament because thats the only part of that crazy book they seem to enjoy? Like there's cool stuff in the beginning too. A dude kills a giant with a rock and I'm pretty sure Indiana Jones opens the Ark of the Covenant.
</p>
<p>
	As he slithered up to the table Axewound again gave him a reassuring knod and wink. She had done everything for him this past few hours. He was pretty sure she rigged the game being as Seth was sure that all of those cards were just made up and no game ever uses cards like that. I mean the Carribean QUeen? That's pretty weak.
</p>
<p>
	As Seth strapped in each needle punctured his scaley skin and each potion began to couarse through his veins. He felt nausea and power all at once. And finally he felt immense pain.
</p>
<p>
	CRACK STAP. His snake spine cracked apart splintering to dust inside of him. Each piece setting itself again as a new limb. The jagged edges of his broken bones pierced his skin like  knives while his spine itself sawed through his back and extruded out in spikes not seen since the dinosaurs were being tamed by Jesus. Look it up its in the new testament says my nana.
</p>
<p>
	Seth howled in agony as the chants from the red robes grew louder and louder. The blood river itself began to boil as the stench of hot metal and iron filled the steamy air. Seth cried out in pain as he looked down to see his tail split in twain and become 2 rudimentary legs. His legs snapped back and forth postioning themselves like wolf legs. Claws sprang from his newly formed feet and ripped through the skin sending more blood into the already blood soaked humid air. Seth was exhausted but again gnarled bones cut through his shoulder area to form 2 arms. And then he passed out.
</p>
<p>
	The table slowly tilted downward as each needle exited his skin with a hiss and a pop. The straps themselves gave way as Seth slid wet and slimey down the metalic table and was dumped into the boiling blood river. The red robes stopped chanting.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly as if he was birthed from Heck itself, Seth shot up out of the hot blood. He was 7 feet tall and had the muscles of a guy who just broke up with his girlfriend and has to excersise the pain away but then gets really into it...like obnoxiouisly into it and won't ever shut the fuck up about the gym.
</p>
<p>
	With a roar Seth flex his muscles as the remaining remnants of the straps that once held him down snapped like any time I put my totally real giant weener inside of a condom that isn't a magnum. Don't look it up.
</p>
<p>
	The red robes again began to chant as Axewound twirled her staff and cackled.
</p>
<p>
	Seth roared again and silenced the crowd.
</p>
<p>
	"How do you feel my new minion" Axewound asked gently.
</p>
<p>
	"MORE SNAKES FOR EVERYONE" Seth shouted as he flexed an anime flex pose and then a freeeze frame happened.
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
