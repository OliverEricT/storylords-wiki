Ep 25

Towels and outhouses

Don't Ask for Whom the Towel Drops it Drops for Thee

	"Arlight lets get this over with" Reeses said as he looked Ugla up and down. "Well you don't look rough so that's a good start" He said patting her feeling for any broken bones on curses or whatever.

"What....how....where..." Ugla struggled to form the thought as she shoo'd Reeses hands away from her.

"What how where HEHEEE" Reeses cackled. "This isn't Nick News W5 Starring Linda Ellerby my dear. SPIT IT OUT"

Squib slowly looked out from behind Ugla's robe and caught Reeses' eye.

"Ohhhhhh HO a sidekick! Good good mmhmm mmhmm" he said holding out a hand for Squib to shake. He declined and went back to hiding behind Ugla's leg.

"Fig Nuton?" Reeses asked as he held out a Fig cookie. "They say these things have wasps in them but if eating wasp butts is wrong I sure as hell don't want to be right?"

"What is this place?" Ugla finally shouted. Sandles reformed back into a cat and sat airplane ears on her shoulder.

"NOW THAT IS A COHERENT QUESTION I CAN ANSWER" Reeses said spitting wasp butts and crumbs out of his gross old man mouth. "This is the Inlet of Eth Dol'more or the Inlet of ED for short. It is where wizards go when they die"

"Wait...WE'RE DEAD?!" Ugla screamed.

"No no no no...well.....no and yes" Reeses said picking wasp butts out of his teeth. "You see as wizards we are granted certain...perks. One of which is no wizard ever dies the first time they well...die"

"What!?!?" Ugla shouted leaning down now. "What are you talking about that is stupid as fuck and I dont remember anyone ever telling me this. This is something I think I'd remember"

"You should really read the fine print on your magical diploma my dear." Reeses said as he pat her head condescendingly. "As you well know being a wizard, we are charged with mystical oversite and the arcane nurtering of this realm. Being that this is the case we are afforded some 'do overs' or 'magic mulligans' or 'malluligans' as it were. Shit I have about 69 different lethal alchemical compounts sitting next to my tea kettle at home that'd make your mama say 'BOYS don't touch mama's special elixers because they are for your father and it is laden with arsenic which I am feeding him slowly to make it look like an accidental death so we can move to Graal and start our new lives as circus folk'. We deal in dangerous shit and we need to be about to learn from our mistakes. That can't happen if the first time you fight a dragon you actually die or the first time you muck up a teleportal you accidentally chop off your head."

"So we ARE dead?" Ugla asked again.

"Well not really. Like I said we get certain perks. This place is kind of like a resort for magical beings. You're very much physical here and not 'dead' per se. But, you are displaced from time. When you wish to return you may return to the time of your death in any location you wish in the realm you originated from.'

"Ok I want to leave" Ugla said firmly.

"You can't" Reeses said even firmly-er. "Come come you have to relax. This place has CRAZY good sushi and the bar is free. All inclusive. OH LOOK ITS SATAN! HI SATAN ENJOYING THE BEACH TODAY?" Reeses yelled down the beach toward a red unfathomable evil cloven hoofed dark lord of all knowing.

"REESES MY FRIEND. YES I AM WORKING ON MY TAN. HOPE I DON'T GET TOO......RED! HAHAHAHAHAH" Both he and Reeses laughed heartily.

"That guy is the best. Killer partier." Reeses whispered to Ugla. "Now come. Let us talk more back at my condo"

MEANWHILE IN GRAAL

"Attention....Attention" Joey PIzaa said into the all hear mic. "As your new mayor I hereby declare on this day, July 420th of the 69th era Graal officialy FREE!"


Orcs and skelemen and gnomes and dwarves and ant dudes and anyone else I ever wrote about began to shout and cheer in triumph. Their new mayor, Mayor Joey Pizza, had handed out free pizza and root beer for this independence day event and people generally go fuckin nuts for free pizza. But free pizza AND ROOT BEER! If Graal wasn't already a shit hole this place would be like Philly circa Feb 2017 GO BIRDS NICK FOLES IS GOD EAT HORSE SHIT EVERY DAY.

"I promise" Joey went on. "As your mayor I will be just the right amount of corrupt in order to get things done but also not so corrupt that its all up in your face and makes you feel icky and then we have to come back here and have another riot and burn more bodies like we're doing today right now with the Paladins of Daranos." Joey gestured his hand in waving motion to the side where a pile of bodies were burning alive inside their golden armor. 

"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD JUST KILL US" one of the burning Paladins screamed as he was wearing flame resistant armor and instead of killing him the fire was just making him really really uncomfortably hot.

"FOUND ANOTHER ONE!" An orc from the crowd said as he dragged a beliguered Paladin by his left foot down the street toward the angry root beer drunk mob.

"DO A BURN OUT ON HIS FACE" Chic Pea yelled as she held up a stein of fresh root juice. She clinked her glass with Peppercorn and they both saluted the Paladin sarcastically.

"Now that seems a bit excessive for a punish...." The Paladin began but it was too late. THe orc was already revving his bonercyle and doing a fuckin long ass sick as fuck burn out on the paladin's face tearing all the flesh off almost immediately like putting a crayon into tea light. The crowd roared as the now defaced Paladin sat up and sighed.

"Great...Now I'm a skeleman. How am I gonna get work now? Nobody will hire a Paladin with no face. Maybe I can do kids parties as Ghostrider? Do kids like that character? Is he getting a new film soon again?" The  Skeledin thought as blood dripped down his white fleshless face as he tapped his finger against his bare bone chin.

"You can always get into BARDING!" Gary said as he flambouyantly strummed a loot around the Skeledin making bard noises. "lada deeee la da doooo la da doooooooom" he sang.

"What is with this skeleton?" Chic Pea leaned down off the top of the bone van to ask Sid who was sipping a stein of root beer quietly.

"Yeah I dont know. He's calling it a 'rebranding' but like...I dont know what his brand was before this so to me he just decided he wanted to be our bard. Which is fine but he sucks major dicks at singing."


Chic Pea laughed. "HEY GARY!"


"Yes my dearest gnomish queen!" Gary said with a bow.

"Play the Graal National Anthem!" She said flipping him a coin.

"WITH PLEASURE!" Gary said as he begain to sing.

"TAKE ME DOWN TO THE PARASITE CITY WHERE THE WEED IS GREEN AND THE ORCS HAVE TITTIES! OH Won'T YOU PLEASE LET ME BOOOOOOONE.....UR BUUUUUUTTTT"

At this the crowd went totally wild like that scene in Can't Hardly Wait when the kid from Hook gets cool because he drinks and does drugs. Which is, by the way, the fastest way to get cool in High School. Trust me. I was Prom King.

Sid took another sip of rooted beer and looked over toward Gunk who was sitting on the street holding Duncan's famous magical gun. 

"Ah shit lets get this over with" Sid said as he slammed the rest of his root beer and headed over to Gunk.

"How're you holding up....no that's dumb" Sid said to himself. "How uh....are things? No thats fucking idiotic I'm bad at this Gunk"

"Ya don't say..." Gunk replied not looking up. He could almost still feel Duncan's warmth on the ivory handle of the pistol. He saw some grit on the trigger guard that must have been from Duncan's hand. Maybe some grease from the Bone Van or just some grit that natually gathers around a tool that is used often. Was this all that was left of his friend. HIS BEST FRIEND! Reduced to a stain on a piece of metal. Filth to be polished away and forgotten about. Some things never change, Gunk thought to himself.

"Look" Sid said sitting next to him. "I'm uh....I'm sorry about Duncan. And I want you to know I'm not trying to replace him. I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to do? Lead a gang? I'm a loner Gunky...a rebel."

Gunk fingered the grit on the trigger guard rubbing it off onto his own hand. And there it was...gone. Duncan was gone. Forever. Just like that his best friend was truly no more.

"I'll save you the trouble Sid." Gunk said standing up. Fully erect he reached Sid eye to eye and also when he stood up HEEEYYY OH. THATS STORY LORDS LADIES AND GENTELMEN SEE YOU NEXT SEASON! Wait....we have one more episode? Well SHIT!

"I'm leaving the Flamingos" Gunk said firmly as he reached out with his right hand. Sid looked down at it and began to go for a handshake but Gunk just scoffed.

"Give me the keys to the Bone Van" Gunk demanded.

"Oh yeah sure...." Sid said relinqueshing the keys. 

Gunk placed the magical revolver inside of his breast pocket of his coat and turned his back on Sid. Sid felt....bad? Was this what people felt when they were....whats the word? Responsible for the death of someone? Ew this was gross and Sid did not like it.

"Hey Gunk" Sid finally manged to get out. "IF.....if you need us...." Sid tossed Gunk a silver coin emblazonned with the thief guild logo. 

Gunk looked down at the shining silver running a finger over the hooded skull figure on its face. "I won't" Gunk said as he dropped the coin. It didn't make a sound as it hit the stone street. Sid sat there on those same stones alone for a long time.

CUT TO: Eth Dol'moor

"Why the FUCK can't we leave!?" Ugla demaned to know.

"Look" Reeses held up an All See Ball. "Signed by Bard Ruth himself! Had to fight a giant dog for it while my friends built all kinds of whacky contraptions to get it back from the dog when we used it as a baseball one summer...crazy times"

Ugla sighed. Squib was sitting in a high chair eating cheese off of a magical cutting board that just kept replacing the pieces of cheese after every bite.

"This stuff is GREAT" he said with a full mouth. "Where does this come from!?"


"Cow's TITS!" Reeses said excitedly.

"Hmmmm. Shoulda known" Squib said as he closely examined his next peice of cheese.

"REESES!" Ugla shouted trying to get his attention like a mother would try to get the attention of her child with undiagnosed ADHD...what was I saying?

"You told me to go on this quest! You told me to seek out the lady of the lake! You TOOOOLD me to keep going until I find answers and now you want me to sit here and listen to you talk about cow tits and fuckin summer with your 12 year old friends in some imaginary place that you probably just made up because you're fuckin insane.....oh" It finally hit Ugla. "You're......you're insane......." She slumped down into her chair next to Squib who was still eating.

"Yes yes I'm insane blah blah blah" Reeses said. "Look....." He moved ot sit next to Ugla. "There are things I  can't explain because I have not the answers yet." 

Ugla shook her head and closed her eyes. 

"It is possible I told you to do these things. This version of me has no memory of that. Maybe because it hasn't happened for me yet or maybe I simply just forgot."

"Yes because youre INSSSAAAAAAAANE" Ugla screamed.

Reeses calmly set the all see ball down onto the table.

"In order to preserve the realm I had to do the one things wizards are not supposed to do." He said calmly.

Ugla looked up slightly. "Make a never-ending cheese buffet that would cause an elephant to have hard shits for the rest of his life" She said with a smile.

"No...." he said seriously. "I had to ensure that when the time came when I was needed I had to be there. But where is there? When is there? How could I be THERE WHEN THERE IS A WHEN that maybe I haven't whenned or thered yet? I am old Ugla. Very old. As far as I know a wizard of my ability has no expiration date. So with that in mind I assumed that whenever i needed to be at a certain there I could just create a time paradox and duplicate myself and place myself in key moments of history"

"That....seems like a fucking TERRIBLE idea" Ugla said with a sort of laugh.

"Naaaah....Time's a strudy bitch" Reeses said patting his hand on the table. "She can take a lot of weird shit and keep pretty much intact. So the me's that told you to do those things probably had their reasons. It's possible that a version of me told you to go find this cat sword but that version of me is older me going back before this me, which like I said is in a sort of hyperbaric time chamber witih you right now. If I were SMART I should have realized that I could just wait for you here upon your first death and then give you the answers you needed which I assume is what I did do and why I am here right now telling you this stuff. Way to go me!" Reeses said patting himself on the head. "NOW COME. TO THE SAUNA!"

Outside Ugla, Squib and Reeses stood in towels in front of an outhouse.

"This is an outhouse Reeses" Ugla said side eyeing him.

"Open her up SQUIBBLY OLE BOY" Reeses shouted.

"Yeah ok but I dont think I'm gonna shit for a month" Squib said holding his stomach.

As he opened the door of the outhouse teh aroma of lavender and incense and soothing oils hit their noses. Inside they could see a lavish sauna that was full of candles and meassures and probably some of them did hand stuff too if you know how to ask politely. I"m assuming. I nvever did that. 

"COME WIZARDS! DISROBE" Reeses shouted as he let his towel drop displaying just how wrinkly and white an infinitely old master wizard with several bizare fetishes and mental problems could be.

"Yeeah...I'll be leaving mine on" Ugla said as she sat on the cedar bench. As she sat down flute music started to fill the air as pixies floated around her spraying her with oils and holy healing salves.

"Oh....oh my" she said as she breathed in the healing scents. Not even  Reeses trying to scrap his old balls off the cedar bench across from her bothered her. This place was....heaven.

Squib sat in his little towel across from an ancient Stag Wizard. He was above 7 feet tall and snorted steam out of his nose as he too was relaxing in the sauna. Feeling Squibs eyes on him he opened one eye slightly. Squib did that thing where you look away real quickly like you were just moving your head but we both know I wasn't I was staring. The Stag Wizard then removed his towel to display the biggest set of dicks Squib had ever seen. They were bigger than Squib.

"Ohhhh deeeeeeer" Squib said with a gulp.

After a long 8 armed massage from Desotrix the Emboldened Ruler of the 9th Plane of Eldrich Lords, Ugla found herself alone on the beach. The moons hung in the sky separeted at their most distant allowing a small sliver of space to be seen through them. Like when people have too big of implants and you can see their breast bone but this is space.

She sighed as she looked at them. Reeses quietly waddled up behind her careful not to be too insane.

"I promise this is the path Young One" he said drawing the moons in the sand. Then he drew nippled on them and giggled as he walked back to his condo.

Ugla shook her head but laughed. "What the fuck" She said quietly.

Sid sat on the cold stones of the littered street of Graal and looked up at the separated moons. He sighed as he thought about how he hurt Gunk. How he hurt everyone. He hurt Ugla. He hurt himself. He probably hurt Flyman somehow since he was basically a walking sack of baby back bitch ribs. No....no he thought. He can't help it. But maybe I can.

The moons shined a little brighter that night both heroes noticed. Maybe all wasn't lost.
