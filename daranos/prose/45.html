Ep 45

Junkyards and Bodybuilders

One Witch's Gunk is Another Witch's Hunk

Daranos faded away. As time passed the forest turned black and ashy and the rivers which once ran wetter than yo mama after I mowed her lawn that one time were now drier than yo mama after I stopped mowing her lawn that one time. The dirt which was once rich with nutrrients and bugs and whatever else makes dirt good and shit, now was red and cursed. Time faded. The suns rose and the moons set over and over and over.

"Now what we have here is a failure to communicate" said a rat with an eye patch holding an ancient looking gun.

"Please sirs...don't....don't kill me. I'm so thisty. I was just looking for a little nip of the ole wet your whistle...the ole liquid libataion...some of that H2BLOW" said a dried out husk of a frog. He had seen better days. His wrinkly ass skin was gross. Like when you get out of the pool after drinking 13 beers and you dont really know how long you were in the pool but you know it was too long and everyone knows you pissed the pool.

"SILENCE you DAMNphibian" said the lead rat. His rat buddies laughed a high pitch laugh. All was still. A single tumble weed rolled by pushed by the wind which itself was quieter than usual. The leader cocked the hammer back of the ancient gun. The click could be heard for miles. The tumble weed stopped dead in its tracks and got up on 2 tumble weed wooden legs.

"Ahhh I ain't seen nothing fellas....YOINK" said the tumble weed as he picked up his suitcase and skidaddled out of there faster than after I fertilized yo mama's second lawn with my special fertilizer called "my jizz".

"Please Mr....I didn't mean nothin by it...honest" the frog pleaded for his life.

"You think the TUNNEL RATS are gonna suffer a water thief like you? My ancestors fought you green skinned water breathing slick backs for generations. I'll be DAMNED if I'mma gonna let you take whats rightfully mine" said the Tunnel Rat leader.

"Boys...looks like frog legs is back on the menu" he said with a smile as he aimed right between the frogs froggy eyes.

Suddenly a golden portal zooped open right where all this nonsense exposition was taking place. The portal sliced the Rat leader in half bisecting him from skull to tail. His two half slowly slid off each other like pie off a clowns face.

The other rats ran for their lives as a tall half naked hot as fuck pg-13 as hell made for the 18-40 demographic necrowitch stepped out of the portal. In her arms she carried a dwarf who looked like he had seen better days. Parts were falling off of him, literally. The S&M Sexcromancer magiks used were desicating his skin. He was falling apart from the inside out.

"OH THANK GOD YOU SAVED ME!" Shouted the frog. "How can I ever....." but he never finished his thought. Axewound's 6 inch heel pierced his skull and impaled him as she hurried along into the desolate wasteland before them.

"Dagobah system....BEN" murmered Gunk as he passed in and out of concious thought.

"I knew I shouldn't have shown him those old All See Flicks" Axewound said. She was moving as fast as a super model in heels and a skin tight leather bikini could move. This was her fault. She...she couldn't let Gunk die right? That would be....unfavorable she thought to herself. 

As the suns drew closer to setting Axewound felt a shiver run up her spine. Where the hell were they? She portaled to the future but she was in such a rush that she must have gotten the location wrong. She stopped for a second to scan the horizon.

"Yup...nothing but desolate wasteland...just like Twitter" she laughed to herself. "Ok we'll work on our tight five later. Now we have to get us someplace warm for the night, Gunk". She felt her mouth turn downward in a frown as she looked down at his dust covered half dead face.

She set him down gently and rubbed her hands together. The night in the desolation was cold and dark. She held out her hands and used a basic fire spell to create a fire rune on the ground. She then used a basic blanket spell to create a blanket and cover both her and Gunk up. Gunks condition was worsening. And the smell. Axewound couldn't tell if this was a normal dwarf stank or the fact that his body parts were already turning greener than the Linc during December GO BIRDS. She closed her eyes and tried to sleep. The rune would keep them warm and safe for now.

"HELLO THERE" an annoying voice pierced through the darkness and jolted Axewound awake.

She shot up and held out a fireball in one hand and an icey ball in the other.

"Who the fuck!?" she stammerd as the sleep was fading from her mind.

"Don't worry I'm not here to harm you...just passing through..." said the man. "Name's Feces the Disguise and I'm a very unique individual and nobody else is like me. You can tell because I have this second very real mustache on over my grey beard."

Axewound held the fire ball out and pointed it aggressively at the stranger.

"Go away or I'll cook you where you stand and eat your ass meat while you're still taking in your final gasps of air." she said like a bad ass.

"Ho ho..." Feces laughed. "I am something of a Sexual Adventurer myself. Until I took an arrow to my peen. And by arrow I mean chlamidia. Sure feels like arrows whe the pee is coming out. And not like iron arrows. Like those stone ones you find at parks and stuff with the jagged edges...."

Axewound enlarged the flame bold. It seethed in her hands directly proportional to her anger.

"Your friend there...." Feces pointed at Gunk. "He looks...well he looks like total and complete shit if you don't mind me saying. Sex magik huh?"

"How....do you..." Axewound lowered her arms a bit.

"I'm something of a sex magician myself...Until I took an arrow to the"

"SHUT UP!" Axewound screamed. She held her magik bolts high again. 

"I know a place that can help him." Feces said pulling a stick of beef jerky out of his beard and biting into it.

Axewound again lowered her arms. 

"Tell me. NOW!" she demanded. She was already standing over Gunk and picking him up.

"Just follow the tumble weeds. They'll lead ya right to a...a doctor of sorts." Feces gestured his hands all around. Tumble weeds were rolling to the west.

Axewound was already 20 paces away when Feces said "You're welcome" in a sarcastic tone.

By morning Axewound was trudging along. The weight of Gunk and the lack of sleep, food, and water were now taking its toll. Even her magical abilites needed a rest now and then, though she wouldn't ever admit to it. As the suns peaked up over the western sky (yeah its backward here) she squinted and instantly felt the heat of the blazing fireballs sting the whites of her eyes. 

But ahead she saw it. A...trash heap. 

"Great..." She said to herself. "Why did I listen to that obviously disguised sex weirdo who snuck up on us in the middle of the desert in the middle of the night" she said to Gunk and herself. But she trudged on. As she finally made it to the outer gate of the trash heap she collapsed to her knees.

"HELLO!" She yelled. "HELLO IS ANYONE HERE!?". The sound of her heavy breathing was the only answer she recieved, until...

"beebeeebeeep" Said a 3 foot tall automobot on a ball wheel. It's blue eye scanned them both. 

"Let us in, robot" Axewound demanded.

"Beebeepbeeep" the automobot responded as it pulled a giant frankenstein switch. The gate of the trash heap began to squeel open slower than yo mama's trash heap squeeled open for me last night. Like I got work in the morning damn bitch.

The automobot grabbed Gunk and held him while they three ventured into this obvious junk yard in the middle of nowhere. Axewound could see parts from all sorts of automobots and bone cars and bonercycles and whatever else. Sex dolls. People gotta throw those out too ya know. Can't just put them on the curb. The borough won't have that! Trust me.

Soon they arrived at a ramshackle cottage in the middle of the trash heap. The bot opened the door and laid Gunk onto a table and let out a series of whistle boops and buzzes. Out of the backroom came a haggard ass road wench who had to be about 230 years past her prime.

Axewound actually scoweled at the site of this ancient swamp hag who had turned in her swamp rags for dusty desert armor and leather. She somehow kept the swamp stench though.

"Welcome welcome I am Mama Meadow" the old crusty bitch said. "What do we have here?" 

Mama Meadow took out magnifying glass and examined Gunk's lifeless body. She ran the glass up and down and squinted through it like she was actually doing something.

"Fix him. NOW" Axewound shouted. 

"Ahhhhhhh" Mama Meadow said as she opened Gunk's eyes with one hand and moved the spy glass back and forth.

"Fix him or I'll turn your insides PH levels into something slightly more acidic as slowly your body rejects all your organs and you will beg me for a quick death." Axewound held up a hand with green powerful magic.

"AHHHHHHH" Mama Meadow said still examaning Gunk. "You...you're a...magic user". She stopped herself from being too specific. 

"And you're a healer so heal him" Axewound said getting more and more annoyed.

"I was once a magic user" Mama Meadow said not paying attention to the growing anger that was Axewound. "I was a witch."

"Ya don't say" Axewound said eyeing the witch up and down.

"Fought in the wars I did..." Mama Meadow said. She was now crushing up some herbs in a mortar and pestle. "Yup...fought against Magic Hitler in the first Mana War. As you know he was trying to kill all the Shrews...."

Axewound rolled her eyes. 

"Yup...but we stopped him and sent him to the past. Some say he now occupies the body of english fellow who does a relatively 'okay' podcast. Does a hell of an impression of himself though....yup...lots of witches died during that one....."

Axewound was getting furious.

"FIX HIM OR I'LL"

"Yes yes..." the witch cut her off. She then held out her own hand and absorbed the magical energy from Axewounds hand. Her body shuttered as she licked her lips and fingers of the magical power.

"That's the stuff Mama like" she said as she rubbed the magic into her gums. "Look here's the thing. I can't fix him" she said bluntly.

"I WILL KILL YOU" Axewound began to power up again.

"BUT" Mama Meadow cut her off. "I am a body builder now." 

Axewound tilted her head and smiled wryly. "Really. Because you look like you weigh 89 pounds soaking wet." 

"No no no. I build bodies. I literally build them. Like old Diesel here." She said as she clapped on the automobots head. CLANG CLANG. "Built him to help out around here although he does more lookin at cicuit schematics than helping out"

"Beebeebeeeb" Deisel replied.

"So here's what I can do for him." Mama Meadow said putting on reading glasses. "We're gonna give him new arms and he's gonna need a new heart. Seems like someone used some kind of sex magic on him and caused his heart to explode with pure jizzextacy. Good thing his second heart is still relatively ok...."

"Do it. Whatever it takes." Axewound went to turn around.

"That only leaves.....payment" The witch said licking the end of a quil.

Axewound slowly turned around and grinned. "I am the apprentice to THE only power that exists here. I can offer you any and everything. I can give you your youth back. I can make you more attractive and powerful than you ever were. Your magic would be feared. Or beloved. So you WILL fix him and then...AND ONLY THEN...will we discuss your pathetic payment." Axewound's eyes glowed bright green as she turned around and went outside.

Mama Meadow simply smiled and began her work.

RECORD SCRATCH

"Deisel my sweet" Mama Meadow began. "Though I appreciate your musical abilty maybe we shouldn't do a montage right now. I mean we have to draw this story out. Plus you're a robot and we already have a guy who does robots. We just heard a story form him. He's amazing at science ficiton and the guy next is INCREDIBLE at spooky monster stories. We really need to stick to our wheel house or else we probably will get fired."

"Beebeebeeeb" Deisel said.

"Yes but we dont want to be too good or else the patreon money will go up so high then we'll DEFINITELY be fired. Its a fine line." Mama Meadow said to the audience I mean Deisel.

She worked into the night. Sparks flew as she ground down metal into movable and amazing mechanical joints. She perfectly machined fingers to tollerances only seen on the Cyberbonetruck. Her frayed greyed hair fizzled as sparks landed onto her head. She rubbed sweat from her brow and adjusted her goggles. When she was nearly finished she put her final touch on her master work. The initials M&M on Gunk's new mechanical left bicep along with a heart.

Axewound sat outside and stared up at the stars. Daranos' two moons hung over head. She could see the stars even through the debris of the half destroyed moons. She sighed. Out of the corner of her eye she saw a 4 foot tall brick shit house of a jacked up dwarf robot walk over to her. When he got in front of her did the moonwalk which he turned into a backflip. He landed on his stomach and did the worm then front flipped back onto his feet and did the "TA DA" hand thing.

Axewound just shook her head and tried not to smile. Gunk sat next to her without saying a word.

"I'm...." she coughed as if the words were stuck in her throat. "I'm....sorry. I shouldn't have let you do that ritual" She looked back up at the stars unable to look at Gunk.

"I wanted to." Gunk said sounding the same as he always did. "Besides we needed to get out of there."

Axewound kept looking upward. "When did you know I wasn't Ruby Rubbleborn?" 

"When we were watching Pretty OrcWoman" Gunk said.

Axewound finally turned to look at him. She tilted her head and squinted. "What?" she said almost laughing.

"I was looking at your boobs not paying attention to the movie and I saw you change form for a second. You thought I didn't notice all those times my girlfriend turned into an almost 7 foot tall leather mommy dominatrix? That's something you tend to notice, Axe" Gunk said laughing.

"Why didn't you say something? And why didn't you....I don't know" she stopped herself. "Why did you stay? I mean I'm evil as fuck"

Gunk and Axewound sat there in silence for what seemed like hours. Finally Gunk spoke.

"My best friend died." he simply said. 

Axewound returned her gaze to the stars.

"He died and I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing ya know? It's like my body is this weird bonecar that my soul is just hitching a ride in. I don't think it matters. I don't think much of anything matters...if it ever did."

Another long moment of silence.

"I never had a best friend" Axewound admitted.

Gunk reached out and with his new cold metalic hand grabbed Axewound's.

"You have me" he said smiling at her.

"You are so gay" she said. But she didn't move her hand. She would never move her hand again if she could. Slowly the cold metal in her hand became warm. As if he read her mind Gunk squeezed slightly more tightly. And her hand got a little warmer.

"WELL ISN'T THIS A HEARTWARMING SPECTACLE" Mama Meadow shouted over an All Speak Speaker or whatever I called a microphone last time. All around her the blue eyes of automobots shown through the dark. Their lasers darted around zitting and scanning anything and everthing. Atop the largest junk pile, Mama Meadow was decked out in full metalic armor along with an ancient staff.

"Why buy the tit juice when I can have the whole magical big titted cow?" Mama Meadow shouted. Axewound and Gunk stood up. Gunk clenched his newly metalic fists. Axewound's eyes glowed green with power.

"So I will be taking ALL of your magical power little Miss Green Eyes" Mama Meadow laughed maniacally.

"You DUMB BITCH" Axewound shouted back. 

"You don't know the ancient magik you are dealing with, GIRL" Mama Meadow goaded.

Axewound smiled a wry sleek smile. Her teeth bared like fangs through her red lips.

"YOU do not know who WHO are dealing with." She said simply.

With that she let out a screech of wrath. A shockwave toppled junk piles and the cottage. Green magic rippled through the junk yard as Gunk was already on top of a group of automobots. He ripped into them with his bare metal hands pulling out cooling pipes, and cables, and pumps of various kinds. His hands were slick with oil and the petroleum smell hit is nostrils. He liked it.

Axewound was Dark Pheonixing her way up into the sky. The night glowed green like Grave Digger was throwing a rave. She shot bolt after bolt at automobots. They zitted and died in place. Some exploded. She opened her eyes wide and green beams of magical cyclopian energy shot out at where Mama Meadow was standing. Meadow shielded herself but the green eye beams crackled and thundered against the shield. Meadow braced herself and held onto the staff with both hands.

Gunk was surrounded by golden bots. He smiled as he unleashed 2 energy swords from his forearms. He spun around and decapitated 2 bots at once. The other bots simply looked at each other and shrugged. But it was too late. Gunk was bisecting them like they were a free peice of cheese from the deli when your mom takes you shopping.

Axewound zooped into a portal. Mama Meadow looked around sweating. She was in over her old ass raggedy ass birds nest hair havin head and she knew it.

"Peekaboo" A voice from behind said. Mama Meadow turned but it was too late. Axewound held out a single hand and raised it. Every muscle in Mama Meadow's body seized like they were getting tazed for protesting in a public place. Axewound smiled and tightened her grip.

"No...PLEASE NO I DIDN'T MEAN TO....AHHHHH" Meadow shouted as blood began to run from her ears and nose. She was crying blood. This coughs of viscous bloody mucus filled her throat.

"You didn't mean to?" Axewound smiled. "You didn't mean to what? You didn't mean to step to the Queen? You took your shot and you missed. Now I will take my shot. And I DO NOT miss" Axewound leaned in and whispered into Mama Meadow's ear.

"Begone. THOT" she whispered as she planted a single long kiss on Mama Meadow's lips. Wither her power, Axewound turned Mama Meadow around in mid air to face Gunk who was already gearing up for a Falcon Punch.

With one single uppercut Mama Meadow's head ripped from her neck and flew into the night. Her gargled screams growing faint as her decapitated noggin flew out of the atmosphere and into the the stars that Axewound had so been admiring.

The two stood in a pool of blood and oil gasping for air. Their chests heaving with excitement and adrenaline. Gunk laughed first. Then Axewound. Slowly they looked at each other and in a moment of pure violent extacy they kissed.

Axewound ripped off clothing and Gunk ripped off other clothing and like the start to all great romances, they boned, on top of a pile of trash.
