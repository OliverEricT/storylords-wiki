EP 21 Concerts and Arm Wrestling


SPINDERHELLA


	Daranos. The 26 episode long story that's all filler and no killer. So long it'll make your mama say "Boys, why do you think there was an episode starring the Mirkmonks last week? Is it because the author doesn't know how to end this season of whatever this show is called now? Or do you think perhaps he lacks the confidence in himself to commit to the post modern ideal that his writing embodies his style, covering up his insecurities with humor as a sign of a true troubled mind? Anyway, me and your new daddy are gonna bone down to the all the porn parts he puts in the stories because it gets MILFS wetter than submarine's torpedo tube".

Ugla wandered through a dense forest. What was she going to do now? She had few leads and even fewer allies, except for Friddert Bingle of course.

"You know you don't  have to keep following me?" Ugla said over her shoulder.

"Oh it's no trouble at all young lady" the gnome janitor said.

"Yes...yes that's why I said that to reassure myself it was no trouble at all for you and not because (she began to whisper) you're carrying a piiss rag as a staff"

"Besides" Friddert continued "As the last of the Wizards I am obligated to travel with you as your squire and butler and plummer and life coach and stylist" As he finished he applied more lipstick onto his old ass crackly lips.

"I have no idea what to do about this Friddert!" Ugla turned to yell back at her squire/stylist. "Daranos is fucked. Fucked right up its own dick hole!" She stopped walking and slumped down onto a stump. She covered her eyes as she let out a long primal scream. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH FUCK THIS SHITTY SHIT"

Friddert walked up behind her and patted her on the back reassuringly.

"As your life coach I have to tell you that it is ok to feel this way. There are no bad feelings only what we do about those feelings" 

Ugla began to laugh. Like a crazy person laugh. And then she began to scream in utter frustration. Friddert grabbed his mop and began to mop the leaves on the ground.

"Besides" Friddert continued. "I know someone who can help us"

Ugla raised her head still covering her mouth with her crossed arms. "You...you know someone!" She said incredulously. "Who?"


CUT TO:

A doorbell chime rings playing Space Truckin by Deep Purple.

"Uuuuuughhhhh" Reeses says as he rolls over uncovering himself exposing  his  naked ass saggy old man body and really old dangly balls. "yeah yeah...stupid doorbell...stupid great asss song."

The doorbell again rings starting the song over. "I'M COMING!" Reeses shouted. As he rolls out of bed two naked hot banging hotties. One a Merman and the other a fully fuckable centaur with banging boobs. 

"Come back to bed Wiz Daddy" the merman said sleepily and then fell back asleep. As Reeses made his way to the door he rubbed the sleep and hangover out of his eyes. His head was splitting. How much giggle dirt did he sniff off of that merman's fin last night? The last thing he remembered was going for a horsey back ride if ya know hwat I mean...I mean he fucked that horse chick.

As he opened the door there stood a chick with a beard and a short janitorial gnome who was mopping up some leaves again. 

"We don't want any" Reeses said and began to slam the door. 

"Wait! Mr. The Wize." Friddert interupted. "It's me! Friddert Bingle. I cleaned up your vomit at the XXXmas party 420 years ago. Remember?"

Reeses stood there rubbing his temples with his right hand trying to keep the vomit down.

"Ah yes of course...Friddert Bingle!" Reeses said probably just tired of standing up. "Please come in come in let me make us some hangover tea. Do you guys have a hangover? I sure don't. Say how'd you find my tower anyway?"


"You drew a map of it in one of the privy stalls at the library but instead of an X marking the spot you drew your tower as a giant chode" Friddert said. "Your stylization of othe veins was quite ahead of its time"

Friddert and Ugla made their way into the kitchen of Reese's tower. On the floor were books and parchments. Orbs and All See Balls. And porn. Like a really unnatural amount of porn. As they sat down at the table Ugla couldn't help but stare. Here he was. One of her heroes. The famed Reeses T. Wize. Slayer of Slaughterpuss. Archmage of Anarchy. The Main Jizz Wiz in all the land.

"I'm sorry Mr. The Wize" She finally broke the silence. "But I was led to believe that ALL wizards were gone" She said pointedly staring at Friddert who was cleaning lipstick off of his tea cup.

"How am I supposed to knowk what I said in episode 16? Besides, I believe I said you, Ugla, were ONE of the last wizards" Friddert said breaking the fourth wall and looking directly at the camera. Thats right. Go back and check what I said. And while you're at it tell your sweet mama I'll be over later to tuck you in right after I tuck my dick into her sleepingvag. It's like sleepying bag but you fuck it and yeah...ITS COPYWRITED.

"He's not wrong deary" Reeses said sitting down with a groan. "I am somewhat retired. And if anyone asks I'm 666 years old" He finished with a wink. "Or however old you have to be to collect Social Wizcuritiy. Damn government trying to fuck me over for spending a decade in a hyberbarric time chamber....'100 years in a time chamber doesn't equate to a hundred years in the real world' they said....BAH. So I'm 666 years old and I was fired or retired...whichever" he waved his hand dismissivly. Just then the two naked thots who were sleeping with Reeses rolled into the kitchen doing not the walk of shame but the strut of fame. They grabbed some tea and bagels and began to monch them down.


"Oh don't mind them" Reeses said dismissively. "I met them last night at a Slave Mathews Band concert and well...one thing led to another. hehe"

"Whoa Slave Mathews Band" Friddert said. "Those guys have been touring for like 35 years"


"Yes!" Reeses said. "They literally aren't allowed to stop."

"I'm sorry Mr. The Wize" Ugla continued. "But we need your help." Ugla went on to explain what Reeses already knew. That Daranos was in deep shit. How there was a rising evil and how the crystal showed her visions from the past. How Daran talked to her and told her she could stop the forthcoming apocolypse.


"Yes yes" Reeses said dismissivly doing a line of giggle dirt off of his old ass coke nail. "I know this."

"Well like.....can you help us!?" Ugla said sternly.


"The Lady of the Lake" Reeses said bluntly while stuffing a whole donut into his suck hole. 

"Ok...what the hell is that?" Ugla responded.

"The Lady of the Lake. Go find her and she will have something that will aid you in your quest" Reeses said stuffing another donut between his sex lips.

"QUESTIN QUEEESTIN WITH MY BESSSTY" Friddert sang as he and Ugla made their way west from the shoreline to Lake Queensryche. "Queestin with my best friend we're gonna find a clue to our DESTINY and then we're gonna be BESTINY....frieeeeends"

Ugla sighed. As the day grew long Sparkle Flies filled the swamps around the lake. They were close. Ugla decided to hike through the night. Friddert didn't mind of course because he was deep into a remix of his new hit "My Quest Friend".

Suddenly Ugla held up a fist. Friddert ignored it and kept walking. 

"Yeah dude that means stop" she said pulling on his cloak to stop him. In the distance was a pair of green eyes.

"We're being watched" she whispered.

The eyes skulked in the shadows unblinking. Ugla was captivated. 

"We...we should follow them..." she said to herself. As she began to move toward the eyes they blinked out. Coming to she shook her head. Still....in the back of her mind she couldn't shake the feeling they were being watched.


Soon they arrived at the lake. 

"So do we just dive in or...?" She questioned Friddert.

"Don't worry milady" He said reassuringly. "It'll only take a few millenia for me to mop this whole lake dry then we can find the lady" As he continued to sing his song he began to dip teh mop into the lake and wring it out onto the shore. Ugla again sighed.

"Or I can cast a spell of water breathing on us" she said waving her hands to create the ancient runes. Magic flowed through her whole body as she recited the ancient incantations. Soon around each of their heads was a breathable bubble. 


"Lets go for a swim" She said wading into the cool waters. Friddert followed slowly behind. Even though he was shorter he was slow to completely submerge because when the icy waters hit his dick tip he sent a shock up his spine and he did that tippy toe move you do at the beach when you first get into the water as if that's going to save you from getting your sensitive ass dick from getting wet. I mean you're going into an ocean for fucks sake. What about that move says "Oh yeah I'll keep my precious dick dry from getting wet in this literal ocean of salt water".


As they began to swim deeper into the lake Ugla marveled at the life below the surface. The moons high above glinted off the rippling waters. Bioluminescent creatures lit up as they passed league after league. Ugla reached out to touch a small fish swimming next to her. When her hand grazed its scales the fish lit up in purples and blues and the lights began to sing. All around more fish lit up and the ocean was a concert of singing fish. It was like listening to Explosions in the Sky after you take half an edible and then you accidently spill a milkshake on your foot but you think your foot is asleep.


Suddenly the water began to get very heavy. Like they were swimming in molasses. Then a sudden CHICKACHICKAHCIKA like a cricket but deafening. With this the singing fish extinguished their bio luminousness and went silent. The water was pitch black just like that movie Pitch Black.

Friddert swam up to Ugla and grabbed onto her cloak partially so they wouldn't lose each other and partially for secuirity and comfort. Ugla looked around. The bubble around her face made it harder to see as it rippleed in place. She squinted as something drew her attention downward. Two green eyes.

"This way" she said tugging at Friddert.

The two swam into an underwater cave system. Had there been light they could have seen the sign that said "DO NOT ENTER THIS PLACE WILL FUCKING KILL YOU ARE YOU STUPID THIS FANTASY ASS LAND IS DANGEROUS ON A GOOD DAY AND YOU'RE DOWN HERE SPELUNKING IN AN UNDERWATER CAVE? WHY DON'T YOU JUST FIND THAT RAT WITH A GUN AND HAVE HIM SHOOT YOU IN THE HEAD IF YOU'RE SO EAGER TO DIE" In original Daranosian. It fits much better in the native tongue.

Ugla used her hands to feel the sided of the slippery walls. She dare not use a magic light for fear of losing the eyes in the dark. Why was she following them? She didn't know. But this had to be the way.


The eyes glinted in the darkness and began to rise and so did the 2 adventurers. As they rose out of the depths they entered into a dank stanky ass cave. An underwater grotto as dark as your sweet mamas b hole. Ugla now used her magiks to ignite a glow orb in her hand. This was her first mistake. All around them were the bones of the dead. Dead fish. Dead people. Dead everything. 

"Oh my" Friddert said as he quickly began to mop up some bones. 

Ugla stepped forwards and her sandaled feet landed on a detached jawbone from something or someone. It cracked and popped as she laid weight onto it. The pop echoes throughout the chamber. She winced and closed her eyes hoping she could blink away the sound somehow.

Suddenly there it was again. CHIKCHICKCKCICK. The whickering of something. Something big. Ugla bravely held up her be-orballed hand. Slowly at the back of the cavern she saw a shadow sinking down down down from the ceiliing. Friddert stopped mopping as his eyes became as wide as your sweet mama's bhole.

Just then ancient braziers on the sides of the cavern lit aflame with a green sickly hue. They whicked up at spider webs but didn't burn them. This was old magic.

"Well well well" a gravely voice rumbled through the wet darkness. "Have you come to see The Lady?"

Ugla squinted to see past the green haze to see who or what was addressing them.

"We have your highness" She responded with deference.

"hahahHAHAHAHAHA" The Lady began to laugh. "Such MANNERS. I assume you are here because of the wizard? How is the old cock and balls? Still sending young ones to their DEATH?!?!" With a blur the figure moved out from the green shadows. In the light of Ugla's light orb were hundreds and hundreds of eyes staring back at her. The chittering maw of a giant spider. As the light reflected off of her chitanous body Ugla could see that this spider had giant and I mean GIANT spider sacks for tits. Probably full of silk. Mommy Silkers if you will. 


Ugla held frim even though inside her brain she was pissing her pants and also she may have pissed her pants a little. 


"My lady...." she stammered. "I seek aid to distrupt the forboding evil that is to arrive on these very shores."


"And why would I want to stop something like that" The Lady asked while slowly walking around in a circle around Ugla.

"It effects all of us!" She said firmly. "All creatures of magic and power like yourself will fall if we don't do something"


Again the Lady began to laugh a laugh only a smoking aunt could muster. The stench from her mandibles hit like a dumpster full of diapers behind a Chuck E Cheese.

"I'm sorry but  you seem to have me confused with someone who cares about such things" The Lady said apathetically. "You also seem to have me confused with.....SOMEONE ELSE" As she said this she sidled over to a thrown on which sat the skeleton of a mermaid. The Lady was dead.

"Shit in my dick" Ugla said with instant painful realization.


"I assume you came for this" The Spider said stroking a blueish blade.

"Cold Steel" Ugla whispered.

"Well...COME GET IT" The Spider screamed. In an instant its 8 giant hairy unshaven legs were wrapped around Ugla who was being held uncomfortably close to her mommy silkers. She turned her face not to get a facefull. Up up up they went and down down down they came again as the spider slammed Ugla into the wet floor. With a soggy thud she landed. The wind instantly left her lungs as her paralyzed diaphram spasmed for more air. She inhaled deeply and painfully and gritted her teeth. She turned the light orb into a lightning orb. With a slam of her fist she punched the ground. All around shot bolts of power hitting stalactites and treasures long forgotten. Everything but the spider. 

Ugla reached behind her back and pulled out her concealed staff. With a flick she extended it as its power seethed in the darkness. She shouted ancient and foul curses as purple and blue waves of magic washed over her healing her broken ribs. Friddert was holding his mop up defensively trying to find the spider. With a THWACK an arm hit him in the face knocking him down but to his credit he got righit back on his feet.

Ugla looked over at the sword in the hands of the mermaid. The Spider was hanging above it upside down lauughing. It was playing with them. Ugla mustered all of her courage and magical knowledge. 


"Friddert" She said. "Hold your breath this is going to be weird...and dangerous"

Friddert knodded and sucked in all the air he could and held his breath.

Ugla raised her staff high above her head. She began speaking a language only people who go to snake handling churches would claim to know and those people are fucking weirdos man. With a CRACK she slammed the staff down onto the floor. From each side blue waves shot out toward teh spider and the sword creating a tunnel. Inside the tunnel the air itself burned and evaporated. The molecules of air and dirt and existence itself were relplaced with...nothing. Pure vaccuum sucked Ugla forward at the speed of  light. The Spider cocked her head but suddenly in an instant Ugla was there. She used her blue flame to strike kthe spider in several of its hundreds of eyes. The spider HISSED and screamed giving Ugla enough time to grab the sword from the skeletal hands of the Lady.


"YOU CUNT" screamed the spider.

"BIIIIIIIIIITCH PLEASE" Ugla said swinging the sword around like obi wan when he does that thing when he points at the person. 


Again in the blink of an eye the Spider spun its legs like a helicopter toward Ugla. She held the sword and her staff in an X and blocked the multilple hits of the spiders steel like legs. With a swoop the spider shot a web up to the ceiling and and swung back around pointing a stinger at Ugla? Oh great this titted spider has a stinger? Fuckin sick.


Ugla confidentlly held out the cold steel sword and with a clang.....the sword shattered.

She held the hilt up in disbelief. 

"It...it was a fake..." she muttered. 

"HAHAHAHAHHA" The spider laughed. "Awww broke your sword so sad"


Ugla dropped the hilt and it clanged against the stones as she fell to her knees. She looked down at the broken blade. The impossible broken blade and closed her eyes ready to see the impossible infinity of death.

CRUNCH. Suddenly a small gnome stood next to her. Ugla looked up and saw Friddert holding his mop up defending her.


"RUN" he said to her. "RUN UGLA" but Ugla could not. She was particially stunned by the multiple blows to her head and particially stunned at the bravery of her squire/life coach/plummer/stylist.

Somehow she managed to lift herself up and pointed her staff at the spider. The Spider cackled and drew in a deep breath. When it exhaled green fire shot from its mouth. Ugla slammed her staff down creating a shield around her and Friddert. As she strained against this unholy power she felt her hands burn. Her staff began to splinter and with the last of the fire breath her staff spilntered and exploded in a blue lightning crack.

She held her hands out with nothing in them. They were blistered and already pussing.

"Ugla" Friddert said calming. "Run milady" Without thinking Ugla turned and saw the green eyes pop up from the water below and dip back down. She took a few dazed steps toward the water and turned back to Friddert who was still holding his mop.


"Guess its time for me to rid myself of this arachnophelia" Friddert said with a smile.

In her daze Ugla managed a weak smile. "Don't  you mean arachnophobia?"


"I meant what I said. Quest Friends forever" He said. And as he did the mop turned into a majestic gold staff. Out shot a radiant radial explosion that propelled Ugla into the cavern of water below. Through the murky waters she saw green mix with gold above. It looked like treasure as the colors mixed. Then they faded. Then there was nothing.

On the shore Ugla dragged her wet and broken body up out of the water. She lay on her back gritting her teeth at the pain the sand was causing her blistered hands. She yelled a primal scream. This was all for nothing. And Friddert the Janitor. NO! Friddert the Brave was dead. She was alone. She was alone and had no idea how to fix this. But mostly she was alone.


As she lay on the sand for what seemed like 12 eternities two glowing green sparkle flies zitted around her. They came together and blinked out. When they blinked back there were 2 green eyes staring down at her. Two green eyes and the whitest cat she had ever seen.

"Meow?" the cat mewed down at her.

Ugla got up onto her elbows and then managed the strength to sit upright. The cat purred as it rubbed against her leg. It rubbed its face against her sandaled feet which caused Ugla to chuckle a bit.

"You like sandals huh? Is that what we should call you? Sandals?" The cat meowed and trotted off to a nearby rock

"Hey...where are you going?" Ugla questioned hoping she wouldn't lose yet another friend. But the cat stopped on the rock. Its green eyes glowed and blinked. As it did the white cat became a white and blue sword.

"Oh my golden DICKS" Ugla exclaimed. The sword was imbedded in the rock itself. She scurried over on hands and knees to the sword. Using it she raised herself up and grabbed the hilt. With the gentlelest of tugs she pulled expecting the sword to resist her. It did not. Like melted butter or like your sweet mama taking the condom off my rock hard peener the sword was free.

Ugla raised the sword above her head as a light rain began. Ting TING TING TING the rain sang off of the metal. The sound of cold steel. She held the sword there looking up at it as lightning struck behind her.


The END
