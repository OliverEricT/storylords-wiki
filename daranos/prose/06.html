	Prompt: Trains & Heists
</p>
<p>
	by Josh Henderson
</p>
<p>
	The pitch black night of Daranos was ripped asunder as a loud crackling of magical power ripped apart the fabric of space and time. In its place a pink portal that was Georgie O'Keefe-esque materialized. Like I mean it was pink and everything. Like...c'mon man that is a vagina. I'm not  just seeing shit here. This isn't one of those things where you're like 'is that a vagina?" nah bro this had to be on purpose. Out of the Einstein Rosenpussy emerged 4 figures clad in all black ninja gis and wearing masks to cover their faces.
</p>
<p>
	"(Duncan)Ah man I can't believe our intel on this job was so bad." Said a regular sized human sounding male. He tossed a bag with what was the Daranosian version of a dollar sign on it onto the floor as he sat on a shabby beat up old  couch that must have been filled with a million farts. Duncan had been leading this crew for over a decade and never had he had a heist go this stupidly before and he was apart of the heist to steal the enchanted Jade of Incompetencia, a jewel that made any bearer fucking dumb as fucking fuck.
</p>
<p>
	"(Gunk)Joey is gonna hear about this..." Said a short round dwarf as he too tossed a sack onto the ground. Where normally a clattering and jingling of coins and jewels and like candle sticks and shit could be heard only a loud THUD could be heard. A single cantaloupe rolled out of the sack.
</p>
<p>
	"(chic)I can't believe he had us rob a FOOD BANK" Said a small gnomish woman as she threw down a really cute gnome sized sack that only had like pears and grapes in it. Ya know because gnomes are small. Right after her twin brother popped through the portal as it shut behind him. He threw his satchel against the wall as he sat down on the fart couch with Duncan.
</p>
<p>
	"He said 'BANK'" Duncan said rubbing his temples. "Peppercorn did you manage to steal like anything of value? Like maybe some silverware or like someone's gold teeth or gold donger?" Duncan presssed.
</p>
<p>
	Peppercorn began to rub his tiny gnome temples almost as if Duncan had afflicted him with some kind of rubbing temples disease which is an actual thing that can happen here. People rub all kinds of stuff down the a nub. It's not an urban legend. YOu can actually rub  your peener off. 
</p>
<p>
	"No Duncan I only got these tomatos" Peppercorn said angrily as he gestured to his wet soggy bag of tomatos that were more bruised than their collective egos.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly the All See Ball began to flash and a ghostly appirition began to accumulate around the ball forming into the likeness of another human looking person.
</p>
<p>
	Duncan stood up. "Joey you really fucked us on this one dawg" he said holding up a sack full of dick shaped gords. Like all warty like after I plowed your mom's gord field last night with my dick shaped dick.
</p>
<p>
	"Hey hey calm down Big D. I didn't know you were so picky about which jobs ya know...actually pay you." Joey said as he held up a coin purse and jingled it. Like dogs to a dinner bell all 4 looked at the bag and almost salivated.
</p>
<p>
	"But...if you're not into it I guess you can just get rid of the evidence and not get paid" Joey trailed off as he put the purse into his pocket.
</p>
<p>
	"NO!" Said Chic Pea relfexively as she stood up almost salivating at the sweet fuckable gold.
</p>
<p>
	"We'll...transfer the loot to you" Duncan interupted as he held up his had to calm everyone.
</p>
<p>
	"Good because little Joey Pizza Jr is having his 5th birthday party and I'm making a life size Troll Pizza for him with olives for eyes it's gonna be great"
</p>
<p>
	"You had us do a job so you could make a pizza" Gunk said as he angrly threw his dwarven axe into the floor boards.
</p>
<p>
	Duncan again held his hand out to calm Gunk. 
</p>
<p>
	"Hey have you guys decided to change your name. I mean..."
</p>
<p>
	"Whats wrong with the Flamingos" Peppercorn said narrowing his eyes. "it's a magestic mythical bird that turns pink from eating shrimp. Everyone can respect that." 
</p>
<p>
	"Ya know maybe you'd get better jobs if you...ya know had a better name is all. Like...The Gabagools or The Pizza Cutters or like...I'm just spitballin here...The Pompadors"
</p>
<p>
	"Our name is fine" Duncan said. "What we really need is better jobs."
</p>
<p>
	"Fine fine. I got a new job for ya. Seeing as you's guys's is one of the only outfits left not dead or in custody I think you maybe be perfect for it."
</p>
<p>
	"What are we stealing fruit this time?" Chic Pea said sarcastically.
</p>
<p>
	"My client wishes to keep this one fairly anonimous on account of him being...lets say...a larger than life figure in the public sphere of how you say...influence" Joey said gesticulating. "I'll scroll you the details. There's a time factor here so you need to be very how you say....on time" Joey said making air quotes.
</p>
<p>
	"thats...not how air quotes work" Gunk said. 
</p>
<p>
	"Isn't 'it' Joey continued making air quotes emphasising "it'
</p>
<p>
	"Wh...what" Gunk looked around at the others.
</p>
<p>
	"In the meantime here's your cut." Joey held out his hand and a small portal opened into the room where the sack of coins dropped onto the floor followed by a sealed scroll with the signet of hte Pizza family on it which was that one picture of that chef guy on pizza boxes doing that air kiss thing. "Delilver the goods to the kitchen Chic Pea" 
</p>
<p>
	"yeah yeah I'll deliver your goods to the kitchen you pizza loving stereotype fuck" she said under her breath. She made a larger portal and the crew heaved the vegetable sacks into the space hole.
</p>
<p>
	CUT TO: Ocean's 11 Steven Soderberg transitions of Gnomes hiding their plans in crossword puzzles and People wearing sunglasses in the day and night and Gunk drinking so much he pisses himself?
</p>
<p>
	A few weeks later. Around the hide out strings and pictures and plans were laid out like this was your republican uncle's thanksgiving day drunk talking points.
</p>
<p>
	"We're gonna need a 5th" Peppercorn said smoking a corn cob pipe and blowing out a smoke ring of perfect pair of Double D hangers. 
</p>
<p>
	"I might know a guy" Duncan replied slamming his fist down then it immediately cutting to
</p>
<p>
	CUT TO: another montage of Oceans 11 transitions of them getting into a bone car. A slow mo of them getting out of the bone car and taking off their sunglasses.
</p>
<p>
	"Our guy is here?" Chic Pea said scrunching her nose up. "Smells like a dogman died inside of a pile of troll barf and then shit himself as he death rattled releasing his bowels"
</p>
<p>
	In front of them stood a large amount of nothing. A desert. But also in the desert was a large gladiator arena. Not one of the fancy ones you find in Grall. This one was clearly black market gamblers and fighters down on their luck trying to make some fast coin and since they're fighters they're probably too ugly for prostitution. I mean I'm not judging but not everyone is cut out for the sexual martial arts. As the gang entered a fierce battle was taking place. A large human male was beating an orcs face in with a steel chair. The metalic smell of blood and urine was overpowering. Some in the crowd cheered as each hit landed spraying blood all over the humans beard others hid their faces in their hands, not out of horror, but out of disappointment their fighter was gettig his face literally caved in. DING DING.
</p>
<p>
	"AND THE WINNER AND STILL UNDEFEATED CHAMPION OF THE WASTELAND....FRED THE SKULLPEELER" The announcer held up Fred's bruised hand which was covered in red.
</p>
<p>
	"This guy?" Gunk quesetioned.
</p>
<p>
	"Look Gunk" Duncan knelt down beside his longtime friend. "I know you're the muscle around here but lets be honest you've been hitting the flagon a little hard lately and we might need a little extra help on this one"
</p>
<p>
	"I'M AS FIT AS EVER YOU SKINNY ROD SUCKER" Gunk shouted as he ripped off his curaiss  and flexed his dwarvenly toned muscles. Honestly he was still pretty cut. Dude was pushing like 70 and he clearly worked out. 
</p>
<p>
	(Whistle from background) "hey there Dwarf Daddy" a fellow dwarf patron winked as he sipped his flagon.
</p>
<p>
	"Still got it" Gunk said winking back.
</p>
<p>
	"This guy has a rep for being brutal" Duncan went on.
</p>
<p>
	"So's how is it we can afford him" Peppercorn asked a very good question.
</p>
<p>
	"He's uh....not exactly in the right state of mind. Something happened to him. He's been off the map for awhile...some say he's  uh....."
</p>
<p>
	Just then they looked over to see Fred cradling the clearly dead orc and singing him a lulaby.
</p>
<p>
	"Insane" Chic Pea finished.
</p>
<p>
	The crew made their way around to the dressing room area. Is that what they call the place where gladiators get ready? You know that place in the movie where that dude pisses on Russsel Crow's leg because he's so scared? Is that a dressing room? Green room? Yellow room?
</p>
<p>
	Duncan quietly knocked on the door. "Uhhh Mr. The Skullpeeler" he said softly through the wooden door. The door slid open creakily. On a bed was a sleeping Skullpeeler still with red all over him. Bruises and scars riddled his chiseled cut body. Sweat still glistened off his pecks. His veins were bulging. This dude lifts. Was that his heart beating? No...his pecks just were moving on their own. He must have been in RPM sleep...Rapid Peck Movement. He wore a loin cloth and nothing much else....Their eyes followed down his chest to his abs which weren't a six pack nor a twelve pack but a Bud Lite Cube. This mother fucker had 36 ab muscles. 
</p>
<p>
	"He's sleeping" Gunk said obviously.
</p>
<p>
	"Poke him with something" Chic Pea said sticking out her staff.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly the giant muscle man shot up "POOPY PANTS I'LL GET YOU THIS TIME" he yelled himself awake. Each of The Flamingos readied themselves terrified at what was going to happen next.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh fans..You want an autograph" Fred said still half asleep.
</p>
<p>
	"No not really" Duncan said stepping forward. "We're here for a....job....opportunity you could sa"
</p>
<p>
	"I'm in" Fred interrupted.
</p>
<p>
	"What...you don't even know what we're offering"
</p>
<p>
	"I'm in this story needs to be at most a  half hour so I'm in" Fred said as he looked at the camera. A painfully awkward amount of seconds went by like this.'
</p>
<p>
	"...what......what is he looking at" Chic Pea whispered.
</p>
<p>
	"LETS GO" Fred yelled.
</p>
<p>
	"Uh...you've got a little orc on your beard there..." Chic Pea pointed.
</p>
<p>
	Fred looked down and picked a piece of red meat off his face and proceeded to put it in his mouth.
</p>
<p>
	Gunk barfed. Peppercorn vomited into his own mouth but managed to swallow most of it.
</p>
<p>
	"What" Fred said. "Its beef briscut...we had it in the yellow room after the fight....so moist" he said licking his fingers.
</p>
<p>
	CUT TO: Oceans 11 montage of Fred putting on sunglasses for the first time. Chic Pea practicing portal magic. Gunk making a slow cooked beef briscut in a gnomish slow cooker. Peppercorn tinkering with a crystal. Duncan looking at feet pics on the All See Ball? Didn't he get the memo we were doing montages today? Oh well too late to cut it out now.
</p>
<p>
	Soon the crew found themselves on a bridge overlooking ancient tracks. These tracks were of a long forgotten technology that nobody remembers who or when they were devised. These tracks were now one of the only remaining Bone Train routes that traveled across Daranos.
</p>
<p>
	"Alright...we have to time this right" Duncan said shouting over the wind.
</p>
<p>
	"But I dont even see the train" Fred questioned. He looked down the tracks and only saw a few tumble weeds roll across the desolate reach. "1...2...3" Duncan he yelled as they all jumped. Suddenly Chic Pea pointed her staff downward mid fall and created a portal. The Flamingos one by one fell through the portal into the caboos of a moving Bone Train.
</p>
<p>
	"What the fuuuuuuuuuuck" Fred yelled. "But why have us jump off the bridge if iyou could just make a portal into the train?"
</p>
<p>
	"pshaw" Chic Pea scoffed. "Because Ding Dong the train was on the tracks it was just invisible. These trains run all the time but the Paladins hide them so people like us don't go heisting them. Lots of wealthy idiots ride these things."
</p>
<p>
	"Lets get to the front we're running out of time" Duncan said seriously.
</p>
<p>
	They all proceeded into the next car. It was pitch black. No windows. No lights. The sensation of motion was lessed in the darkness. There was almost no sound.
</p>
<p>
	"What the hell is this" Gunk whispered readying his axe.
</p>
<p>
	"I'll handle this" Chic Pea said waving her hands and creating fire.
</p>
<p>
	"No WAIT" Duncan whispred urgently. As the orange firelight hit the edges of the it gleanend off of two black glass orbs. These orbs were imbeded into the skull of a giant manbat. He hung upside down in the dark.
</p>
<p>
	"This is the Bat sleeper car" Duncan shout whispered. Just then the bat awoke and shrieked so loudly it shattered the glass in Fred's brand new sunglasses he was still wearing to look cool. Gunk wasting no time planted his axe right into the manbat's chest cavity. The bat howled and salivated as the pain of the axe rippled through his body. It continue to scream and writhe on the ground until it stopped........and then awoke again.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh I'm sorry" the manbat said politely. "I was having a terrible nightmare. Oh my..." he looked down noticing the axe. "This is yours I believe good sir" he said removing it and handing it back to Gunk.
</p>
<p>
	"You should be deader than my 3rd wife's labido" Gunk said in shock. 
</p>
<p>
	"Oh you would think so but I am a vampire....so....can't be killed by axes" He said. Suddenly Fred walked up and said "NO WITNESSES" as he twisted the manbats neck.
</p>
<p>
	"OH GOD" Duncan shouted.
</p>
<p>
	"Its ok...." reassured the manbat who now was talking to the wall as his body faced the crew. "Vampire...can't be killed by broken necks"
</p>
<p>
	"Lets just...lets just go" Peppercorn said looking at a crystal layout of the train. 
</p>
<p>
	"Well I hope you enjoy your stay on the train" the manbat waved his hand still talking in the wrong direction. His ears now bleeding.
</p>
<p>
	"That guy was really nice" Gunk said as they entered the next car. This car unlike the last was BUMPIN. Daranosian Techno was pounding through All Speak Balls. There were magical glow sticks and everyone was basically naked. In fact...everyone was naked and they weren't just pounding the dance floor they were pounding EACH OTHER.
</p>
<p>
	"The orgy car..." Duncan said. "Quickly before we get..." Just as he was about to finish a naked raver orgy man came up to them.
</p>
<p>
	"HEY SWEET CHEECKS" he said to Chic Pea. "I BET YOU GOT LIKE DOUBLE A'S...WANNA TAKE A RIDE ON THE TRENT TRAIN" He said drunkly.
</p>
<p>
	"Of course your name is Trent" Chic Pea said pushing past him.
</p>
<p>
	"Where you going little lady" Trent said stumbling nakedly. " I have like 4 drink tickets with your name on them. Come have a drink with Trent"
</p>
<p>
	"You know what Trent" Chic Pea said thoughtfully. "I just might" She then took the tickets from Trent. "Lead the way big fella" she said
</p>
<p>
	"We dont' have time for this" Duncan scolded.
</p>
<p>
	As Trent turned around Chic Pea slammed her staff on the floor the car. The crystal in the staff glowed red and she chanted some ancient incantation. Trent grabbed at his  neck. Then he coughed. He gripped at his neck as if something was tied around it. His body was frozen. His boner was frozen. He couldn't move. "What have you done to Trent?" he said panicked.
</p>
<p>
	Chic Pea finished the incantation. Suddely all of the blood in Trents body was teleported out of himself. The blood came crashing down from above like a torrent of horror. HIs empty mummified husk was drenched in its own blood. As it hit the floor people cheered. 
</p>
<p>
	"Way to go Trent" one dude said laughing
</p>
<p>
	"Trent....not again" Said another. "Your game needs work bro" But nobody really cared because if someone isn't getting exsanguinated during an orgy is it really even an orgy?
</p>
<p>
	Duncan looked down at Chic Pea disappointedly.
</p>
<p>
	"What?" She shrugged. "Free drink tix"
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly Peppercorn's crystal watch went off. "We don't have much time lets go" he yelled.
</p>
<p>
	The crew rushed to the front of the train. Peppercorn used some weird looking metalic crystal device to open the door to the engineers room? The engineers dressing room? Is that what its called?
</p>
<p>
	Once inside they saw nobody was there. 
</p>
<p>
	"Nobody is driving this thing" Gunk said looking out the window for the driver.
</p>
<p>
	"These Bone Trains are portal driven. They enter various portal switches at various points along the bone tracks." Peppercorn explained for the plot.
</p>
<p>
	"What are were doing we haven't even stolen anything" Fred said eating some beef briscut he brought along for lunch.
</p>
<p>
	"uhhhh guys" Grunk interruped. "We have a bigger problem". He looked out the front of the train and  saw a gaping casm rapidly approaching with no bridge.
</p>
<p>
	"Chic Pea...your'e up" Duncan commanded. Chic Pea began to focus. Her staff crystal glowing bright pink. Bright bright pink. Like neon 90s pink.
</p>
<p>
	"Its the first protal switch" Ducan yelled and squinted over the crackling magical power.
</p>
<p>
	"We're not stealling stuff from the train" he continued clapping his hand on Fred's beefy shoulder. "We're stealing the whole fuckin thing!" 
</p>
<p>
	Chic Pea was now glowing and crackling with lightning. Light shot out of her eyes and mouth as she said the final magical combination of chants. In front of them a giant gaping croctch shaped portal emerged right in front of the portal switch point. The train sped through at break dick speed and I think the portal moaned a little when it went in? 
</p>
<p>
	Then silence.
</p>
<p>
	"ALRIGHT YOU MOTHER FUCKS ARE YOU READY FOR THIS SHIT?" A giant dragon yelled to a crowd of people. The crowd roared. 
</p>
<p>
	"I love you Axl" an orc yelled helicoptering his 6 dicks in appreciation.
</p>
<p>
	"I see you brother" Yelled Axl down to the orc as he threw him a guitar pick.
</p>
<p>
	"This one's off our latest album and its called CHOO CHOO PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIN"
</p>
<p>
	Suddely a giant pink vaginal portal opened just as the first beat of the song started. The Double bass drum rattled off an impossible combination of beats. Lightning struck all around. A dude in the front row was lighting a joint when he was struck by a pink bolt instantly dusting the flesh off his bones only leaving a charred skeleton with frizzy hair standing there with a doober in his mouth.
</p>
<p>
	"Whoa" he said.
</p>
<p>
	The train barreled through the crowd no longer guided by tracks. It flipped and jacknifed. Bodies were flying everywhere. The manbat flew out and impaled himself on the scaffolding of the stage.
</p>
<p>
	"Ah its ok" he said. "See...metal" he clanged a wing against the stage. "We're good..."
</p>
<p>
	Mid intro solo Axl the Dragon grabbed the train in mid air and began to nunchuck it around like the dude from Taking Back Sunday. Or perhaps if you're older like Stephen Tyler although I guess both of those references are dated as fuck.
</p>
<p>
	The Flamingo Crew portaled out just in time with Chic Pea's help. They stood on the stage unscathed watching the horror. The crowd was going INSANE. Dudes were headbanging so hard they got vertigo. The Skeleton guy was still trying to light his dub dub. Axl was nunchucking the train so fucking hard the train was craching like a whip. There were so many tits flopping in the audience you could film a Got Milk commercial. Fred emerged from somewhere with a new "Briscut Baby" shirt with briscut stains all over his beard.
</p>
<p>
	BEEP BEEP Peppercorns All See iball watch went off.
</p>
<p>
	"I uh I trust da job is done" Joey Pizza said.
</p>
<p>
	"WE ARE WIFEBONES! Lets hear it for my crew" Axl yelled to the audience. "THE FLAMINGOS"
</p>
<p>
	The audience got super quiet. Crickets chirped.
</p>
<p>
	Skeleton Guy began to slow clap. Then a big boobed troll lady joined. Then another Dward clapped faster.
</p>
<p>
	THE FLAMINGOS everyone shouted and cheered.
</p>
<p>
	THE END.
</p>
