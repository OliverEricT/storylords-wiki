<p>
	Prompts: Katanas & Socks
</p>
<p>
	Thump thump thump thump. The only thing Sid could hear were his 2 hearts beating in his 2 ears. What? You thought trolls had 4 ears? Well they don't not everything is doubled. Get over it ya double dick loving perverted bitch ass bitches. As Sid's feet pounded against shingle and stone and straw sweat dripped off his super sexy troll face. 
</p>
<p>
	"OI DIS WAY LADS" yelled a guard. "I can smell his trolly sweat a mile away" he said again super racistly.
</p>
<p>
	Sid was running for his life, painting under his arm, while his other arm grabbed onto a clothes line strung between two buildings. He Batmaned his way onto a lower roof and parkour rolled making sure not to scuff or damage his loot. A blur in the night. His heist of the warehouse like building a few episodes ago didn't quite go as planned, but hey, he did get to see a fuckin ghost orgy so you win some you lose some. Or as I like to say "You cum some you screw some".  Another guard popped up onto a roof in front of Sid. Thinking fast Sid did the classic Sid Slide and went 5 hole between the guards legs. As he did he pulled out his trusty dagger Lil Pointy with his free hand and cut the guards achilles tendons on each leg. 
</p>
<p>
	"Oh not again" said the guard as he felt the tendons roll up the back of his legs. Lets be honest. This guy never will walk again and truthfully the city is probably going to thrown him into a big pit full of skeletons like the Spartans used to do to babies they thought looked weird or cried to much or whatever. Yeah thats a real history fact and depressing but hey ya cum some ya screw some.
</p>
<p>
	In one motion Sid righted himself as a few darts flew past his face. 
</p>
<p>
	"Reload bois" a guard yelled as they stopped to reload their fucking shitty crossbows. That Rat had a gun last episode, should probably look into that you morons.
</p>
<p>
	Sid one hand leapt over a chicken coop and as he did so slid the cage door open releasing all of its murderous chicken captives.
</p>
<p>
	"FUCK CHICKENS" yelled yet another guard. Chickens in Gral are fuckin insane man. Don't fuck with chickens they'll peck your dick hole right off. But it was all for naught. Sid looked forward and in front of him were 2 more sets of guards and a stone wall leading up to a rooftop almost 6 stories taller than the roof he was currently doing sweet parkour on.
</p>
<p>
	"Give up thief" Guard #4 said. "GIve us back the orgy painting and we'll only cut off your hands....and maybe just but 1 singular dick but no promises." the guard finished as he licked his lips? ACAB.
</p>
<p>
	Sid clenched his sweet chadly muscles and summoned his muscle fibers to listen to his brain thoughts for just a bit longer. Lactic acid coursed through his veins. His body was burning and aching. He had been running for so long. If only he had a potion......or if only Ugla was here she could buff him with some cool spell or show him her boobies that would be sweet. Or maybe he should buy some Daranosian Fine China White...should he start to do cocaine?  He sprinted toward the guards.
</p>
<p>
	"Uhhh boss?" Guard #5 said perplexed
</p>
<p>
	"SHOOT HIM DOWN" yelled the #4 guard. As he yelled Sid launched himself into the like Michael J'Orcdon. As he reached the towering stone ediface in front of him he straight up spider man ran horizontal style up the wall like I did to your sweet mama's sex cave last night. She really puts the Whore in Whorizontal. Reaching the zenith of which his tired legs would take him, Sid leapt backwards kicking off the wall and gracefully did a fucking mad sick flip in the air while he burried his dagger into Guard #4's eye killing him instantly and ensuring his relatives would have to have a closed casket, just the way Sid liked his funerals. In one motion Sid round house kicked the other guard in the face sending him to the ground with a broken neck. Like this dude's head was spin me right round Dead or Alive style dawg. Bet you thought that song was by Franky Goes to Hollywood. Yeah its not I looked it up.
</p>
<p>
	As shooting pain struck like magical lightning through Sid's shoulder. "DA FUQ" he thought to himself. The force of an impact spun him in the opposite direction of the hit. As he turned in slow motion he saw a mage who did in fact shoot him with magic lightning.
</p>
<p>
	"Magic Lightning...my only weakness" Sid said knowing full well he had many weaknesses. Stab wounds, Fire, Undercooked pork, peanut allergy, and commitment were some others just to name a few.
</p>
<p>
	Sid tumbled over the side of the building. He fell and he fell. It felt like an eternity. His daggers were gone. Lil Pointing stuck into guard #4's eye socket and his other dagger, whos name I do not nremember because I made it up like 8 years ago, dropped from his hand when he was struck. He still held onto the painting though. This job wasn't over yet.
</p>
<p>
	CRAAAAAAAAAAASH! Sid hit something. He wasn't lucky enough to hit a passing hay cart. No, nor was he lucky enough to hit an awning like in the movies. You know when the stunt people just fall through awning after awning? Like...save some awnings for the rest of us. Jeez louis. The air left Sids 4 lungs for a second and he gasped panicked for air. As he sat up and regained the use of his diaphram, all he could say was "Ow".
</p>
<p>
	Turns out Sid crashed into an All-See-Booth. But why did it smell like shit? Turns out Sid crashed into an All-See-Booth someone was using as an All-Pee-Booth. And an All-Poop-Booth. Gral. Gotta love it. The big Batple they call it. Then the Night Court theme played. Plus nobody uses All-See-Booths anymore, not after the iBall came out. ANYWAY!
</p>
<p>
	The guards from above began shouting more orders as Sid slowly limped away then managed a half hearted limpy ass run as he slipped into an ally and made his way out of the city.
</p>
<p>
	As Sid reached the forest he began to look around for the tel tale signs that every cool thief knew to look for. Hobo sygils. There on a stump was some graffiti scratched into the bark.
</p>
<p>
	"For a good time Call your sweet mom who's sex cave I glazed over last night you fuckin little biiiitch" Nope. That wasn't it. But he remembered the iBall number.
</p>
<p>
	There! On another nearby stump he saw what looked like an arrow that had been carved over with eitght equals D with the words "This way" crossed out to now read "Dicks Way". The classic thief mark for a safe house. 
</p>
<p>
	"Dicks way it is" Sid chuckled to himself. "Classic" Soon he arrived at a delapidated cabin. It looked like nobody had been there in quite a long time. He krept his way in. There was a single candle on a shabby table, a bed, a fireplace with tons of weeds growing out of it, and a barred up window.
</p>
<p>
	"Hello stranger!"
</p>
<p>
	Sid reflexively grabbed for his daggers forgetting that he had lost them on the rooftop. Lil Pointing probably still stuck in that guards face hole. A blue flame arouse from the candle and turned into a little flame faced elemental. 
</p>
<p>
	"Please use your thief union signet ring to use this Safe House facility" the elemental said calmly. 
</p>
<p>
	"Hold on" Sid replied as he rumaged through his various sacks and purses and coin baggy things.
</p>
<p>
	"You have 30 seconds to produce your ring..." The elemental urged.
</p>
<p>
	"Hold on hold on" Sid said still looking for the ring.
</p>
<p>
	"You have 25 seconds to produce your ring or I will burn the flesh off of your bones. The agonony will be so extreme it will surely follow you into your next life. You will beg for death's mercy as soon as you are reborn" The Elemental said smiling
</p>
<p>
	"Got it" Sid exclaimed as he slid the ring on and found a socket next to the candle on the table. He turned the ring. "Thank you for using Safe House Industries we hope you have a lucritive stay!" said the elemental.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly the old cabin's interior shifted. The bed was made perfectly. The fireplace lit up with a bright warm welcoming fire. The table with the candle produced food and sweets and meads. On the exterior plants and leaves and vines and trees grew up all around cabin concealing its pressance from any passers by. Your mama's gonna love it here when I sex her good when you go away to college. Remember to wear flip flops in the shower. The lighting dimmed and Sid could smell ginger. Ugla used to smell like Ginger....
</p>
<p>
	Sid took the painting in his good hand and propped it up against the wall. He then laid down on the bed and sleep took him.
</p>
<p>
	Tap tap tap.  Tap tap tap tap.
</p>
<p>
	"SHUT UP" Sid yelled reflexively still asleep. "Tap tap tap tap" 
</p>
<p>
	As sleep took him again Sid saw only the blackness of the inside of his eye flaps. "Mew" he heard. "Mew mew". 
</p>
<p>
	"SHUT UP I SAID" Sid yelled into the void. Out of the darkness two piercing green eyes blinked into focus. "Mew". As quickly as the eyes appeared they vanished now replaced by fire. The whole world was fire. "MEEEEEWWW" he heard screaming from a distance. This mew was much more manly and much bigger? He knew this mew. It pained him to hear this mew.
</p>
<p>
	Sid shot up awake. Cold sweat poured off of his face. On his chest a black void with green eyes sat purring. "Mew" it said licking its paw and cleaning its whiskers.
</p>
<p>
	"How did you get in here" Sid questioned as he pet the cats side. "Mew" it replied.
</p>
<p>
	Sid shot up awake...again. Sweat pouring off his face. "I am so fucked up right now" he said to himself. But again he heard it. Outside this time. "Mew"
</p>
<p>
	Sid grabbed his pack and opened the cabin door. The camoflauge gave way and he was again in the woods. In the distance of the darkened woods he heard the mew again. Green eyes blinked out from behind a tree some distance away. 
</p>
<p>
	"Wait" Sid whisper yelled under his breath.
</p>
<p>
	The eyes blinked out. 
</p>
<p>
	"Where are you going!?" Sid asked as if the cat would respond.
</p>
<p>
	Again the green eyes peaked out from another tree this time much much futher away. 
</p>
<p>
	"How did..." Sid began.
</p>
<p>
	Sid pushed back the leaves of a very large hedge bigger than your sweet mama's 70's bush and before him stood the cat. "Mew" it said as it turned to look into the darkness. Sid squinted to see what the cat was looking at but its hard to see a BBC at night. But there it was...a Big Black Cave.
</p>
<p>
	"You want me to go in there?" Sid asked looking down. The cat only responded by rubbing himself against Sid's leg.
</p>
<p>
	"alright....but this doesn't mean we're friends!" 
</p>
<p>
	Sid stepped into the dark and his new friend followed.
</p>
<p>
	In the darkness Sid could hear a voice and see a faint din of a fire deeper into the BBC. He could barely make out the words being spoken....no...not spoken....sang. Someone was singing. Then he heard the teltale sound of a lute being plucked. As he inched closer he hid himself behind a rock that looked like a giant tiddy.
</p>
<p>
	"Lightning crashes
</p>
<p>
	An old mother dies
</p>
<p>
	Her intentions fall to the floor
</p>
<p>
	The angel closes her eyes
</p>
<p>
	PALE BLUE COLORED EYES" A discordant sound sprang from the lute.
</p>
<p>
	"Wait wait" Said a really dorky voice. Sid saw him readjust his terribly fingering and start to play the tune again as his new friend the black cat poked out from behind the tiddy rock and "Mew"
</p>
<p>
	"Socks!" said the Lute Nerd. "You're back...and you brought a friend" Suddenly the nerd whipped his hand and a blue ball of energy shot out. It slowly crawled through the air and stopped over Sid's hidy hole.
</p>
<p>
	"I seeeeee you (snort laughing)" 
</p>
<p>
	Sid stood up. 
</p>
<p>
	"Oh a thief" Said the Lute Nerd. "Well let me introduce myself. I am Wizrad the Big Dicked (snort laughing). And I am in the business of creating and enchanting magical slightly gray market (whispers undner his breath) totally not black market, weapons! I see you've met Socks"
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah Lute Nerd I'm not calling you that name you said. Why you call him Socks?" SId said looking at the cat "He's completely black"
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah...he's wearing black SOCKS....DUH (snort laughing)" At this Socks jumped up onto Sids shoulder and purred.
</p>
<p>
	"Well thief let me show you my wares" Wizrad said. With a flourish of his small tiny hand a rack of weapons sprang forth from the behind a wall panel. There were maces, shields, flails, whips, chains, handcuffs smack a lil booty up in my belt scream help.
</p>
<p>
	"I see you are without weapons. Perhaps this one piques your interests" Wizrad grabbed a sword from the rack. It's yellow color shown brightly. As he pulled the sheath of there shown a bright yellow katana.
</p>
<p>
	"This ones name is Corntana on account of it being imbued with the POWER OF CORN!" Wizrad emphasized as he raised the sword above his head. 
</p>
<p>
	"Wow...amazing" Sid said dripping with sarcasm.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh....oh no..." Wizrad stuttered as he froze in his cool pose. "No...no wait....NO"
</p>
<p>
	"Knock if off nerd I dont' want your corny ass corn sword. What else ya got kid" 
</p>
<p>
	"Pplease...hhhheeelp...." Wizrad began to tremble. Socks hissed.
</p>
<p>
	The room darkened and a wolf howled. Thunder rumbled through the cave. Sid again instictively grabbed for his daggers but again..."Damn farts shit" he said under his breath.
</p>
<p>
	Wizrobs skin began to jaundice. He let out a cornly howl. Everywhere on his body corn leaves began to sprout. Rocks from the cave began to crash down  onto the cave floor. Wizrad grew in size and girth except for anywhere that counted like  his dick and muscles but mostly his dick. That shit was still small as fuck. Suddenly all that stood before Sid and Socks was a giant corn monster.
</p>
<p>
	"Alright Wizrad...that's a pretty cool...uh....yeah neat" Sid said trying to remain positive and cool headed.
</p>
<p>
	"I AM NO LONGER WIZRAD" The beast said. "I AM HUSK". With that Husk drew his corntana upward and swept down at Sid and Socks. Socks leapt from Sid's shoulder and hissed and scratched. Cats fuckin hate corn. Sid artfully dodged the clumsy oafish small dicked attack even though he still was somewhat injured. Sid posed up like a karate man centering his big dick chi. He was fighting a corn man. Gral baby...The Big Batple. And then the Miami Vice theme played.
</p>
<p>
	Socks mewed. "It's ok little guy come here I'll protect you" Sid said. Socks jumped up into Sid's arms but as he did Socks bit down hard on Sid's blue troll skin drawing red blood.
</p>
<p>
	"Ouch fucker! Why did you bite ME?" Sid yelled.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly Socks' green eyes began to glow. Not like when they were in the woods but like his eyes were at a Laser Zep concert and they just started playing Black Dog and the dude in front of you just straight up whips out a bong. How'd he get that into the venue you think...but then you get so second hand stoked you start to see green laser eyes. Just like that.
</p>
<p>
	 Socks mewed and himself began to transform. The blood dripping from his cutie mouth. His body transformed into a sword. A blood sword, black obsidian and harder than my dick on prom night. Unbreakable some may say. And not too big but also not average in size. I'd say above average really. Probably in the top 98% of swords if I had to guess. The black blade reflected all the cornly yellow light that was eminating from Husk's corn aura. Husk again swung slowly. This time Sid blocked with the sword...or socks...or socksword? KLANG!
</p>
<p>
	The reverberation of the clash knocked Sid back across the room. Husk laughed. "HERE KITTY KITTY" he taunted. Sid closed his eyes and again he saw the eyes. The green eyes. "MEW" Socks sceamed directly into his brain. "Wait...you can do that?" Sid said to the sword. Suddenly the sword began to glow. First brick color then red then ORANGE. It was getting hot. 
</p>
<p>
	"Well....if we're gonna die might as well go out high is what I always say" Sid said as he put a giant spliff into  his mouth and lowered his spectral glasses.
</p>
<p>
	"Hey Cornboy" Sid yelled at the giant corn monster. "Suck my cob!" Socks burst into flames. He was a flaming blood sword. Sid lit his spliff with the flames then extended the sword and focused firing a face melting beam of fire at Husk. Upon seeing this the God of Metal played a sick double guitar solo with all four of his hands and double tapped so fast it made the angels cum their white ass stupid robes. The wolf from earlier howled again and then was immediately vaporized by the heat or maybe from the guitar solo. Where the wolf once stood now only flimsily stood a skeleton of a wolf that was now a skelewolf and fuckin put on some wrap around shades and howled like nothing even fucking just happened.
</p>
<p>
	"SHHHHHHHHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS" Husk yelled as he burst into flames instantnly because corn is fucking flamable and stupid as fuck to make a sword out of. All the corn on Husk's body began to pop and soon the cavern was full of popcorn like at the end of Real Genius.
</p>
<p>
	Husk was gone. Socks transformed back into his cat form and Sid lifted him out of hte pop corn. "You're fuckin dope dude" He said as he kissed Socks on the head. Suddenly a rustling of pop corn began. Sid readied himself but out spran Wizrad, seemingly back to normal.
</p>
<p>
	He coughed up some pop corn. "DID I DO THAT"
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
