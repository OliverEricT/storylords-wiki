Ep 33

Blood and Festivals

Cocky Horrny All See Ball Show

 Boris gripped Princess Tomestool, the talking magical book that is totally real, as branches whipped at his face and dick. He was running so fast even his Vampiric heart was beating out of his chest. Behind them he could hear the claws of a menace tearing through trees and bush. The thuds of its giant feet smashing into the ground as its massive stride got closer and closer to Boris his Tomestool.

"Use those little chicken legs and RUN!" Screamed Tomestool to the vampire.

"What do you think I'm doing you legless talking book of fart jokes" Boris screamed back.

Behind them the behemouth roared. Boris thought about looking back to see what they were being chased by but a prickle on the back of his neck just above the spine froze his gaze forward. Up ahead he could see a large hollowed out stump from an ancient tree the size of your mom's ancient crotch casm. A real Grand Cumyan.

"In there!" Tomestool yelled

"SHUT UP BOOK SHHHH" Boris shushed as he wrapped his arms around Tomestool both to secure them from sight and to shut her up. Boris sat in fetal position and tried to catch his breath. Whatever was chasing them was fast and big enough to chase down a vampling. Boris quieted his breath and peered out of a knot hole in the stump. The only thing he could hear was the rain drops patting against the leaves above. He focused on the knot hole when suddenly 

"BLAH" he shouted. One giant yellowed and bloodshot eye peered into the hole as its pupil irised wide adjusting to the light.

"What the fuckin dick hole is that" Boris said to himself. As he looked back to the knot the eye vanished from sight and all was quiet.

"Did...did it go away?" Tomestool asked hopefully.

"TAINTMAPLE WANT PEENER BACK!!!!!" yelled the monster as it roared with the rage of a thousand cut off boners. Raising a giant wooden mitt Taintmaple, the cursed ancient treeant, raised a hand began to pount away at the fragile wooden wall separating Boris and Tomestool from Taintmaples dickless rage. Only about 6 inches of soggy rotten oak between them and certain death. CRASH CRASH SMASH. Taintmaple's fist slammed against the wood slowly breaking away at the barrier until he could get a single spindly branch of a finger through. Boris covered his face as Taintmaple plunged his finger in and out of the stump's vagina....I MEAN knot hole. Twigs whipped at Boris' face cutting him. 

"MMMMM" Taintmaple said as he began to really enjoy fingering this tree stump. "Taintmaple like sexy tree hole".

"Oh gods no" Tomestool begged as Taintmaple began to really get into fingering this tree stump.

"IT NOT THE SIZE OF TOOL IT WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH TOOL" he roared as he deftly pleasured the stump and himself with all the sick perversion you'd come to expect from an ancient tree who's tree dick was cut off like a hundred episodes ago.

"OH YEAH BABY GIVE IT TO MAPLE DADDY" Taintmaple howled.

"This is the worst episode I've ever been in..." Boris said as he covered his eyes.

Suddenly Taintmaple let out a ROAR as gallons and gallons of maple syrup shot from his branches into the stump.

Somewhere up in the trees a Mirkmonk was working on a model acorn inside of a slightly larger acorn when he heard the roar. Tying his bathrobe around his waist and putting on his readers he burst out of the front door of his tree house and began to yell.

"HEY!" He began to scold but upon seeing the aboslute degeneracy of the situation below he quickly turned around.

"Nope" He said as he went inside and locked his little wood tree door behind him.

Taintmaple's rampage had cum to a halt as he lay back down next to his stumply date and began to snore the snore of a thousand jizzes.

"Be. Very. Quiet!" Boris said to Tomestool.

"OKAY!" she yelled back in acknowledgment.

Boris quietly tip toed around Taintmaple's withered and dried branches as he was sure the behomouths refractory period could be up at any moment and he did not want to be around for Round 2: Finger Lickin Boogaloo.

"Look at that!" Boris said pointing into the stormy night. "A castle! Maybe they have some towels we can use to wash off all this shame."

"Where did that fucking castle even come from I didn't see it before" Tomestool said suspicion dripping from her voice.

"Right now I don't care. We need to find the Wizard and get you into safe hands. Axewound can't find you."

"Yeah but this place looks like the red light district in Graal fucked the Grand Cumyan" Tomestool said as she looked over the castle. Along its turrets red lanterns and red magical flames burned through the night. Inside the muted tones of a thumpin party beat could barely be heard. 

"They're having a party maybe we can get some food too" Boris said carrying Tomestool up to the doors. Boris tried to clean the syrup off of himself to look presentable as he used the giant knockers which were in the shape of Triple H Hangers. BOOM BOOM BOOM. A tiny little slit opened at crotch level after a moment.

"OH MYYYYY" a small voice said on the other side of the door. Hearing this Boris knelt down.

"Hey you little Butler man. We need some hospitality for the night could you let us in?" Boris asked politely.

"Oh of course Mr. Bloodsuck we've been expecting you...." The little man said as he giggled.

"Wait, you know who I am?" Boris asked.

"Oh yes sir." The little man replied. "Oh I see you brought your own literature. I sure hope it's got pictures of weeners in it tee hee" he said as he shut the little glory hole peep hole. With that the door opened to reveal an oppulent castle decked out in red carpetting with huge red curtains covering the windows.

"Right this way tee hee hee hee" giggled the tiny gnome butler as he appeared from nowhere behnd Boris.

"HOly ORCHRIST" Boris said with a start. The butler motioned for Boris to follow as he swung open 2 huge doors into a parlor. Inside there were dozens if not a hundred scantily clad party goers who were all wearing Eyes Wide Shut masquerade masks.

"WELCOME MR BLOODSUCK" a booming and menacing voice said from atop a golden throne.

"Hello....Mr....?" Boris searched for a name.

"You can call me LORD DRANKULA." he said as he sipped red wine from a goblet made out of a human skull. It was metal as fuck.

"That's metal as fuck." Tomestool said quietly.

"Why don't we give our special guest the hospitality and....'warmth' that we Vampires are known to give." Drankula said as if honey itself were pouring from his lips. Or maybe maple syrup? 

"Oh well if you insist..." Boris began to say modestly.

"NOT you little vampling.....Your little foliod friend" Drankula extended a pointy ancient finger at Tomestool.

"RUT RO" Tomestool said almost pissing her pages.

"And you little vampling" the Dark Lord said swirling his wine in his emaciated hand. "What will we do with you?" With a single snap of his old ass boney gross fingers the entire room of vampires decended upon Boris.

"AHH WHAT NOOOO FUCK AHHHHHHH"

Meanwhile at Flamingo HQ.

"Sometimes you wanna go WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS UR LAAAME" Fred belted out as he wiped down the bar. Sid sat at the end of the bar nursing a mug of meade while Chic Pea was reading a fashion scroll.

"Oh boy assless chain mail is back in this season." She said to nobody in particular as she licked her finger and turned the scroll page.

ZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP. Suddenly a golden light appeared on the bar right where Fred was whiping. In its place was a single letter, folded neatly and with blood writing scrawled onto it.

"PEPPERCORN! YOUR PLAY ORC MAGAZINE IS HERE!" Chic Pea yelled over her shoulder.

Fred draped the rag over his huge manly shoulder and picked up the letter careful to open it and not rip it with his big manly hands that I wish he'd use to rip my anal virginity away from me what? ANYWAY.

Fred began to read:

My dearest Flamingos,

 It is I, Boris. I have been captured by my kin and require rescue. I know you guys don't owe me anything but remember that time we hung out in my cave? I thought we had some chemistry. Anyway, this letter is magic and teleport you to me. The castle is guarded by like a hundred vampires and there's a magical barrier protecting it but I assure you, Princess Tomestool and I are indeed in this castle.

Your friend, 

Boris Bloodsuck.

".....Who the fuck is Boris Bloodsuck?" Fred said after a beat. Sid sighed and rubbed his temples.

"He's that vampire we adopted like 5 episodes ago I dont know." 

Chic Pea slid over to the seat in front of Fred and snatched the letter from his mits. She turned over the letter and sniiiiiiiiffffed it.

"Lilac and....maple syrup?" She said. Opening the letter she saw that the letter was written on the back of an already printed piece of paper.

"Looks like its from a tome..." She said. She then waved her hand and used Detect Magic. Suddenly a glowing purple orb appeared.

"Yup...this shits magic" it said matter of factly and then disappeared.

"I think I can like backtrace the magical essence on this page and like...use it to create a portal into this castle and junk" Chic Pea said scientifically. "It'll be like really unstable but like whatever I'm up for it if you are Sid"

Sid sighed a long sigh. But something in the back of his mind told him he was somewhat responsible for this vampire hobo. If anything he could do good by him. Unlike how he handled Gunk.

"Fine lets go" he said slamming his fist down. "You in Freddo?"

"Pass" Fred said matter of factly as he opened up the centerfold of a Play Orc Magazine.

"Hey did someone say my Play Orc was here?" Peppercorn burst into the bar. Slyly Fred slipped the magazine down below the bar.

"Nope" he said.

ZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP.

Suddenly Sid and Chic Pea appared in a larder surrounded by porks and meats and like cheese wheels and shit. 

"Man this place is a hobbits wet dream" Chic Pea said looking around. She moved over to an icy cold box and opened it. Inside were jars and jars of a red liquid.

"That's a lot of Kool Aid." She said grabbing a bottle.

"Don't think that's Kool Aid, CP" Sid said peering around a corner stealthily.

"AHHHHHH" Chic Pea wiped juice from her mouth on her sleeve. "Salty" she said as her face curled up in disgust.

"Shhhh" Sid said as he ducked down. Chic Pea followed suit and used her staff to pole vault over the counter to Sids location.

"Yeah so I looked at that book and like there wasn't even any peeners or boobs in it" Said a dapper looking vampire lord.

"No way thats like the best kind of book there is" said another Vampling.

"THATS WHAT I SAID" said the first vampire. Without hesitation Sid held up Socks in sword form and pressed ever so gently into the vampire's throat.

"Shhhhh shh shh" he said. Chic Pea reached into her satchel and used some magical dust to pocket sand the other vampling. He went to yell for help but couldn't make a sound as his lips began to melt together until his mouth all together disapeared like that one scene in the Matrix.

"Boris. Bloodsuck" Sid simply said. The Vampire slowly raised his finger and pointed down the hallway they had just come from. Sid simply knodded and then cut off the Vampires arms and legs Anakin style. The vampling mumbled and stumbled around the larder at the sight of his friends new found status as motionless sex doll.

"Welp guess I'm not getting my dick sucked tonight" He said as he lay bleeding.

"Mmmm Guessh Mm Non getttingg a foot jrrbbb" the other mubmled through his closed mouth.

Meanwhile in the parlor the Vampire orgy was in full swing. Everyone was drinking Kool Aid and had that weird red ring around their mouth that all the gross kids in elementary school had after they either had Kool Aid or ate a Fruit Roll Up. 

"My Lord" said the Butler. "Maybe we should call the Queen and give her the tome. Afterall she would be ever so grateful for our assistance and maybe she'd even join the orgy. I hear she has dope Double D's"

"Nonsense, Frank" said Drankula. "I see no reason to interupt BLOOD FEST 6969 BABY BAAAAAABY" he shouted as the crowd of orgy goers shouted and cummed in approval.

"But my lord..." Frank continued

"Frank if you don't go down there and either get your peener sucked or start sucking a butt I'm going to call a party foul and you know what that means...." Drankula scolded.

"No my lord please....I promise I'll shut up....anything but Edward 40 hands. I can't do it again. And pissing? Its ny impossible to hold my tiny flaccid donger when I have  2 steins of blood taped to my tiny gnome boy hands...."

Sid and Chic Pea slid their way through the castle very quietly. They soon found a door which led down into a dungeon. Sid peeked around the corner and quickly ducked back.

"One guard" he said. "Can you turn us invisible or something?"

"Nah they'll like see through that" Chic Pea replied.

"Ok well...maybe we can bluff our way in. Say we're vampires"

"Nah they like...know they're own kind. It's like Highlander rules for them" Chic Pea said popping some bubble gum into her mouth.

"MEW" Socks said as he transformed back into a cat. "MEW MEW".

Sid just looked at Chic Pea and shrugged. Before they knew it Socks was already stealthily prancing toward the guard.

"What is like he doing?" Chic said blowing a bubble.

"DID YOU HEAR THAT" said the vampire guard looking down at his crotch.

"Thats nothin baby let Spice Sourpuss take care of you" said a tiny gnome just going to town on this vampire's 12' to scale donger.

Socks crept behind the guard and slowly raised himself up behind him. He reached out with his two little stick arms and grabbed the around the chin.

"Shhhhh mew mew mew" He said as he used his cutie paws to snap the guards neck clean. It flopped down into his lap and nearly hit the fairy.

"HMMMPHH" She said as she put her hands on her hips and flew away.

"That works" Chic Pea said amazed. They burst into the jail cell and saw Boris chained to a giant red crystal. Trapped inside of a magical faraday cage of red lightning was a book.

"Please...."Boris pleaded. "Please....get the princess out of here"

"Calm down your majesty" Sid said sarcastically.

"Nooo you must..." Boris choked painfully on his words trying desperately to explain the situation in as little time as possible.

"Hey Big Guy" Chic Pea said looking upwards. "What does that look like to you?"

Sid glanced up and saw that the cell they were in was equipped with a giant glass magnifier. All around them were mirrors.

"We have to get the hell out of here" Sid said super seriously.

"AND MISS THE PARTY OF THE CENTURY" Drankula yelled flambouyantly. All the candled in the room extinguished at once as Drankula entered the jail. Behind him a hundred red eyes glowed in the hallway.

"MMmmthats Tmmthem" said the vampire with no mouth.

Sid quickly unchained Boris who was too weak to stand. He collapsed in a heap into Sids arms. Chic Pea readied her staff as it glowed with purple fury.

"Please" Drankula said as he waved his hand. In an instant the cells door closed and locked itself. The bars briefly glowed red as a spell was placed on them.

Chic Pea fired a bolt at the bars to only have the bolt ricochete off of them and ping around the room a few times causing the heroes to duck and curse.

"The Princess...." Boris groaned.

"This dude had one hell of a torture party" Chic Pea said with a laugh. But she noticed Boris pointing to the book inside of the cage.

"Wait" She said. "I think this dude wants to fuck this book or something hot"

Boris used his remaining strenght to pull himself up to the magical barried and stick his hand through. As he did the pale flesh on his right hand and arm began to boil away. He groaned as he willed his arm to reach further into the cage. Sid crinkled his nose as Chic Pea said "Smells like Kool Aid".

"AAHHHHH" Boris screamed once more as he grabbed hold of the tome and yanked it out of the field.

"Do you know what happens to a Day Walker during a double eclypse?" Drankula said as he rolled a single cigarello. "Well...." he said shrugging. "I guess you'll find out...." With that chains and gears began to clatter to life inside of the cell. Above them a moon door opened to reveal a double red eclypse of Daranos' two moons. As the light from the moons hit the magnifier a white hot laser beam of moonfire shot down onto the crystal as it refracted laser beams all around the cell. Sid and Chic Pea ducked as Chic Pea managed to create a shield blocking a few of the moonfire beams.

"Borrrissss" Tomestool said in a daze. "You have to let me go"

"NO" Boris yelled. "You...you can get us out of here...I won't....I won't let you burn up here"

"Put me....on the crystal" She shouted over the sound of white hot crackling air. She managed to hop out of Boris's grasp and flung herself onto the red gem. Her pages sizzled and charred around the edges as the light of the magnified moons was just enough to penetrate her ancient protectigve magiks.

"NO" Boris yelled as he too flung himself against the gem managing to grab the Princess and peel her off of the gems now glowing red surface. As he did his flesh began to again boil. Pustules of blood and gore began to erupt all over his extremities.

"USE...THE....BOOOK" he groaned as he held Tomestool out away from the beams.

"NO" Shouted Drankula as he removed the magical protections from the cells locks. Chic Pea all at once understanding placed her own protections on the inside of the cells locks.

"Classic Wizard Door Fight" She said with a smile as each used their magic to try and unlock and open the door to the cell.

Sid ducked another bolt and looked over to Boris who was now more than halfway vaporized.

"The.....book" he said with is last breath. His bones and flesh turning to dust. His remaining hand that had been calcified by the faraday cage still held onto the Princess. The remaning power in the tome began to faulter as the heat and light bleached the tomes hard cover and burned almost every page away. Finally the charred book dropped to the floor as a single page flaoted down gracefully like a feather into Sid's hand.

"CP!" he yelled. Chic Pea spun her staff around and used her magic to open a portal with the remaining page of the tome. As the portal opened to Graal Sid glared at Drankula.

"Suck on this" he said.

"Awww I wanted to do the catch phrase" Chic Pea said as she slammed her staff down sending a bolt of powerful energy back at the crystal. As they walked through the portal zoooped closed. The crystal was now over charged with moonlight and mage magic.

"NO NOOOOOOOOO" Drankula said as he a thermonuclear heated blast ereupted from the gem and disintigrated every Vampire in the castle. The castle itself crumbled and explosions were heard accross the country side.

"Dust to dust.....mother fuck" Frank the Butler said as his face liquified and then blew off of his skull like in Terminator 2.

The next morning.

"What the absolute fuck happened here" Ugla said as she and Demi kicked over the rubble of what once was a castle.

"Mew" Buffcat said as he held up charred skull with fangs. It disintigrated in the air as he whiped the ash from his paws.

"Looks like a tree fucked a stump and blew maple jizzup all over the place" Demi said as she was doing a balancing act on a giant stump.

"Smells like....lilac and maple syrup....and..." She sniffed and was immediatly hit with a familiar scent. "Troll Spice" She said under her breath.

Demi was now digging through the rubble. As she did she picked up a burnt cover of an ancient tome.

"C'mon Demi. We have to get to Graal" Ugla said shooing her away from the rubble.

Demi began to put the tome down but hesitated. She looked at its golden inlays. It was as if it was speaking to her. She deftly placed the tome into her satchel next to Jelly.

"Now don't eat that Jelly" She said smiling at the baby cube.

"DEMI WHERE ARE YOU" Squib yelled form the distance.

"COMING" she said as she ran.

FIN
