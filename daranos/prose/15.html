The Pizzafather Part 3

It was a dark and PORNY night. The kind of night that'll soak your panties straight through to your bone. The streets of Grall, still steaming from the day's hot supple suns, steamed as the rain poured down in buckets. The smell of sweat and blood and 3 stung Joey Pizza's nostrils as he rounded a corner into the back ally he had walked to thousands of times. He pulled his collar up on his leather armor to shield his neck from the chilly rain. Yep, the gods sure were taking one hell of a hangover piss tonight and Joey couldn't help feel like a german pornstar just taking it right in the face.

Joey reached out his meaty right mit and grabbed for the door handle to his super secret "definitely legal" hideout lovingly named the "Pizza Hut". But as he did a chill shot up his cowardly spine as the door lurched open slowly with only the slightest of resistance. 

"Ay yo somethin's up in here" Joey said to himself softly. The door creaked as he slowly peaked his giant greasy head inside. It was dark. No candles were lit. No All See Balls were lit. No nothin was lit.

"Tugo....Sbarro.." Joey whispered into the pitch black. No one answered. As he krept further in Joey picked up a Maceball that had nails pounded into it from one of the many spots his crew hid such stereotypical weapons. As he tiptoed quietly into the warehouse portion of the Pizza Hut a pungent stank hit his elegant nose hairs. A smell he thought he was rid of. A smell he hadn't smelled since...

"Nice of you to join us Joey" a voice said as all at once every sconce in the warehouse was magically lit with some sort of lightswitch magic. All around stood the infamous dog man gang The Southside Woofers along with their leader Krinkles, a ruthless 3 foot tall Dogman who once claimed the entire East End by pissing on every square inch of the corspes of the East Side's most fearsome gang, The Bloomin' Lilies.

"Hey dere Mr Krinkles" Joey said nervously as he pulled on his collar. He couldn't tell if the rain or his sweat was making him more uncomfortable.

"HEY DERE' Krinkles said mockingly as his gang of Dogmen, wayward gnomes, and any creature shorter than Krinkles laughed at their bosse's jab.

"You knowk why I'm here, Joey" Krinkles as he hushed his crew.

"Ahhh yeah about dat Mr Krinkles I swear I'll have the gold..." 

"Psshhh" Krinkles cut him off. "It's too late for that Joey. I gave you plenty of time to come up with the gold. You think I'm a charity? Huh? Do you think that after I sell all this Giggle Dirt and Brown Centaur and YoYo that I go down to the Grall orphanage, pick out a small child, and then bestow this child with the gold and a new life and have the kid call me 'dada' while I raise them to be a functional member of society like this was some Little Orcfan Annie shit?! HUH?!?!?!" Krinkles cutie nose scrunched in anger as he laid into Joey.

"No I do not" Joey said  hanging his head. "But I got the dough this time and I"

"Boys...shut this sausage finger having onion breath breathing pineapple eating jabrony up" Krinkles demanded as he snapped his paw as henchmen grabbed Joey's arms while another took a maul and slammed it into Joey's diapram. Joey coughed and gasped as the air left his lungs.

"So in light of this I am forced to take drastic action." Krinkles again snapped his tiny paw signalling another henchman to emerge from the shadows.

"Maybe I will adopt a stray" Krinkles said as the henchman struggled to keep a young boy undercontrol.

Joey gasped and looked up to see his son, Little Caeser, in the hands of this criminal mastermind.

"PAPA HELP" he yelled.

"PAPA HELP" Krinkles mocked.

"Little Caeser..." Joey coughed as he tried to calm his son. "It's ok son. I'll fix this. Soon you'll be back with your brothers Degiorno and Ellio and we'll go see your grandpa Papa John down by the coast...I promise boy." Joey said through gritted bloody teeth.

"Get me the gold, Pizza. Or I'll feed your garlic eatin offspring to my henchman as kibble." Krinkles again snapped his fingers as this time two sexy orcs walked out with a collar.

"SEX WALKERS" He yelled. "Time to take daddy for 'walkies'"

The two hot thicc orcs put the collar on him and giggled as they all walked past Joey as he was writhing in pain on the ground.

"Oh and another thing Joey" Krinkles stopped mid walkies.

"Please dont piss on me" Joey said under his breath.

"Boys...make sure Mr Pizza knows we're serious" As he said this 3 henchdogs began mauling Joey PIzza's legs. They frothed at the mouth as they tore through is leahter pantaloons like a hot queef through dick butter. Joey began to sob and howl as the Dogmen bit deeply into his thighs and lower legs. The message here was 'hey you like walkin? well guess what you ain't gonna walk good no mo". They bit and did that dog shake thing that dogs do until they one after another got tired and then each pissed on Joey to mark their territory. As they left Joey's broken body behind they laughed like Hyena's into the night. 

Wait what's that you say? Hyenas aren't dogs? Well look who watched Jack Handy and Steve Irwin. Aren't you smart! Do me a favor and go Jack Handjob yourself off you no it all bitch before I come over to your mom's house and do her all night Hyena style.

CUT TO:


Joey coughed and wheezed as the booping of magical all see monitors displayed his vitals. His humours were misaligned and he had a severe case of demons in his blood as well as a casse of the Horrors soemthin' fierce. Joey tried to move his legs as the cot beneath him creaked. The pain was immense.

"Uh Mr The Pizza" A young apothacary appretice said as she poked her head around the privacy sheet. "There's someone here to see you"

Immediately Joey tensed thinking that it was some Dogmook here to finish the job but as the apothacary left a familiar and somewhat friendly face peered around the sheet.

"Lookin ruff" Duncan said with a smile. "Get it...ruff like a dog" He said trying to lighten the mood.

"You're a real funny guy Duncan" Joey said dryly as he coughed and wheezed.

"The crew and I heard what happened Joey" Duncan said as he fiddled with the magical equipment. "I thought you were getting mixed up with the Woofers anymore?"

"Yeah well" Joey said not looking Duncan in the eye. He couldn't. He was broken and ashamed. Like that feeling you get after jerking off and the post #3 clarity kicks in and you realize you have to write your story for Bros4Prose I MEAN...."I needed the work" Joey flattly said.

"Joey. We've been pullin jobs for you for like 15 episoded now my man. That can't be it. We've been doing big scores. What could you possibly need the gold for" Duncan questioned.

"I..." But Joey couldn't find the words. A tear rolled down his cheek. Duncan had never seen Joey Pizza the Grand Canoli of Grall this worked up. They weren't  friends by any stretch but he respected Joey. The man gave them work and a place to stay when they needed it. He's the reason Duncan had a crew. The reason Duncan had a family.

"It's Little Caeser" Joey finally said with a heavy heart. "He's sick Ducnan. He's got Chronic Buttitis. The Soupy Booties. The Rectal Reckums. The Big Brown Frown Towns. The #2 Ur Screwed's" Joey began to cry uncontrollably.

Duncan put his hand on Joey's shoulder and let him cry it out. Just then someone must have cast a flashback spell because the world got all droopy and that one sleepy song played in Duncan's head as he began to remember a thing that happened in the past. Whats that? This is like the second time I did a flashback episode? Well isn't someone astute. I bet you weren't complaining when you were dripping wet from all those Lost flashbacks. What does the hatch do? Whats with the 6 toed statue? NOTHING. NOTHING is up withi them. At least this story has a plot and goes someone. So shut your MoveMistakes.com loving Plot Hole Misusing Trope Groping tits up before I go over to your mama's house and bang her all night in her Plot Hole.

"Mr Deadeye Duncan is it" Joey said as he rifled through scrolls on his desk.

"Not anymore" Duncan said as he sat across a desk from Joey Pizza.

"Well. I need a crew kid. I really care what you call yourself as long as you can get together a banging crew for me. I'm uh...diversifying and need some 'associates' if you catch my meaning" Joey said using air quotes the whole time. "I've got some leads on some potential partners I want you to look into" Joey slid a scroll across his desk with a few names on them. "You can start there"

Duncan sat and quietly read the names to himself.

"What're you doin get going kid!" Joey said as he shoo'd him out of his office. Outside a crew was stripping a bone car down to the frame.

Duncan read alloud the first name on the list. "Chic Pea....at the Turgid Imp..."

As Duncan strode past the Turgid Imp he could hear all kinds of debauchery going on inside. He approached the Troll bouncer and flashed his Pizza Pin given to all Joey's henches and the Troll let him right in. Inside there were all kinds of perverts lookin at all kinds of butts and tits. A sexy centaur was bucking off a drunk business orc as his gold flew out of his pockets to the cheers of his mates. A cat woman purred up against a dwarf as she played with his beard and then began to groom it by licking it. A human female was dancing on stage. That probably was the most normal thing Duncan had seen today aside from the fact that when she turned around as "Girls Gals Goils" played she had 3 tiddies. The crowd went nuts and rained down gold coins on the isocolese chested dancer. Duncan made his way through a red padded door to the back of the club. The music thumped through the walls muffled by what Duncan could only imagine were decades of sweat and jizz. As he walked past an open door he turned  his head and peeked in only to see a snake lady choking an iron clad pirate.

"Aww yeah baby thats the only way I can THREEEE ARRRRR" he said as he must have three'd. Duncan picked up his pace. Soon he reached the end of the hall where a small door stood alone. The door was small like in that movie with John Malkovich. What was it called? John Malcoviches Big Day Out? He squatted down and entered the door. Inside he saw a small stage and gnomes....like lots of gnomes. Drunk, horny, crazy gnomes. They didn't even notice as Duncan made his way past them to find a few seats he could sit in.

"BOYS PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER FOR SPRINKLES!" The announcer said as the cutain opened and out stepped a scantily clad gnome with long blonde hair and a thong that was probably made for a Barbarian Doll or Barbie Doll. Suddenly "Up" by Cardi B started playing and the gnome began to make bank. Up and down the poll with the grace of a gazelle. She even did that thing whree it looks like she was walkinig on air while holding onto the poll. But that wasn't the extent of it. Soon she began to replicate herself. Twins, then triplets, then quadruplets and then 69-uplets! The crownd went wild as they were swarmed with gnome strippers all blonde and all riffling through their pockets as they danced for the patrons. Duncan could see a hustle a mile away and this...this was a classic. Duplicating stripper who pick pockets horny guys as they get a lap dance.

After the show duncan went backstage and knocked on the door to the dressing room.

"Uh like just a minute Grog I got your cut" The voice said through the door. Suddenly the door flew open and there stood the gnome. 

"Uhhhh who the fetch are you" she said looking up at Duncan.

"I'm..." Duncan said checking her out. "*cough* I'm Duncan. Joey Pizza sent me"

"I already have a gig big guy" She said turning back into the room where another gnome at an allseeputer was sitting with gnome goggles on.

"This job doesn't look like it pays as much as Mr. Pizza's" Duncan said looking at the paultry pile of loot on the floor.

"Like...Go on..." said Sparkles

"Ok but I'm not calling you 'Sparkles" Ducan said. "What's your real name."

"Names' like...Chic Pea and this is my brother Peppercorn"

Soon the crew was now three as 'Sparkles' had convinced Duncan to bring in her brother Peppercorn as he was running all see scams like skimming voids off of the Turgid Imp's comp system as well as a number of other financial scams he was pulling all over Grall. Nobody had ever heard of this kid but that was by design. A tech guy without a trail could be very useful. 

"So who's next" Peppercorn asked still burried in his allseeputer.

"We're headed to the west side" Duncan said. "Dwarven District"

As the 3 rolled up Duncan slowed the Bonecar down. Outside the black of the night was suffocating. Dwarve-Town was no joke especially after dark. The gang pulled up next to an abandoned brewery. 

"Follow my lead" Duncan said as he held his hand up to a brick in the side of the wall. The brick glowed and then receeded back into the wall as a secret door opened up.

"Fetch" Chic Pea said in awe. As the three  decended down they could hear the cheers and hells of hundreds of dwarves. The darkness soon gaveway to an arena lit by braziers and in the center was a cage with two dwarfs beating the absolute piss out of each other while holding a flagons of mead. But as the 3 entered a record scratch sound effect happened and each and every dwarf in the joint turned to look at Duncan and his little friends. 

"OI" one dwarf in the cage yelled. "Who the HELL are YEEEE comin in here with those little freaks ya TALL ASS HUMY FREAK" he said as he staggered and then punched the other dwarf so hard in the face he fell down and shit himself.

"I'm here to offer a dwarf named GUNK a job." Duncan yelled. The dwarves around the arena began to laugh and some whispered to each other.

"What does ur  HUMY ASS want with Gunk?" The dwarf said swigging a glug from his mug.

"Well..." Duncan said as he entered the ring. "I heard he was the baddest toughest dwarf in the game." Duncan smiled at the dwarf charmingly.

"I AM" the dwarf said dropping the pretense. "But if iyou want MY services you have to prove that your worth my time" Gunk said. "DRINK FIGHT" he yelled as the dwarves in the arena lost their shit. Gold began to exchange hands as bets were placed. The ssmart money was on Gunk even though it looked like he had drank more than a few already. Gunk wiped frothy mead from his beard and splashed water on his bloody face as  he poured both he and Duncan a large flagon of what smelled like rubbing alcohol.

"You know the rules you colonizing piece of shit?" Gunk asked. 

"Uh yeah" Duncan said grabbing the flagon.

"You throw a punch you take a swig. If you drop yer flagon you lose. Round is over when we both finish the flagon. If you drink it all first you get 5 free punches" Grunk said anyone to explain to the audience at home.

Gunk instantly took a swig and belted Duncan in the right eye. Duncan, having not been ready, staggered and some of his grog sloshed out of his flagon causing the audiancne to laugh and jeer him.

"OH GLASSJAW HUMY" A dwarf shouted from the back to thunderous laughing. Duncan felt his eye already swelling. This guy could punch. How was he so fast? How did he even reach Duncan's face? Duncan countered by taking a swig and punching Gunk right in the stomach hoping to make the dwarf vomit, but instead Gunk stood tall and laughed off the hit as he finished off his flagon in one gulp.

"Oh feeeeeeeeetch" Duncan said as the Dwarf laid 5 pristine hits to Duncan's stomach causing the human to wheez and buckle at the waist.

Gunk egged on teh crowd throwing his hands up like Rocky while refilling his flagon with swill. Duncan sipped his drink hoping the alcohol would numb the pain he felt all over. Gunk stood straight and allowed Duncan a free hit. 

"Alright Dunc" Ducan whispered to himself as he focused his kungfu energy he had learned as a boy on Ninja Mountain. Duncan concentrated his chi and laid, what would  normally be a game over hit, onto Gunks jaw. Gunk staggered back as one of his remaining 5 teeth flew out of his mouth. Duncan swiftly finished his flagon and balled up both fists laying 1, 2, 3, 4, and a fifth hit to Gunks face the final hit using the flagon itself. The mug exploded on Gunks craggy face as the dwarf now began to bleed from his forehead. The crowd gasped and cheered. 

"ROUND 15" the ring dwarf girl yelled as she sashed her beard around her bikini and held up a sign written in dwarvish runes. Both Gunk and and Ducan were spent, bloody and pretty close to actual death. They had beaten the living piss and shit out of each other for 14 rounds and were 14 flagons of dwarvish grog down each. They were drunkn and broken and tired but niether were giving up. Gunk laid a  hit on Duncan. Duncan responded with another hit to Gunks nose which was no so broken it was merely a hood ornament for his face. 

Finally both fighters collapsed onto each other and hugged as they held each other up. Both held ltheir flagons up.

"You...ur pretty good" Gunk said.

"Ur a baby back pussy ass tampon" Duncan said the drunkest he'd ever been.

"Ahahaha" Gunk laughed. "Now you're talkin like a dwarf, Humy"

"I'll fuck ur mother's bearded crotch clam" Duncan said trying to throw another punch.

"DRAW" yelled the ref as he separated the two fighters.

Chic Pea and Peppercorn raced up onto the stage and held Duncan up. Blood covered his face as he hiccuped and strained to keep the puke inside of stomach.

"Aren't you like glad I didnt make you strip fight me?" Chic Pea said with a smile.

CUT TO:

Back in the present Duncan opened up a chest at the Flamingo's hideout. As it creaked open a red glow lit his face like the blood from that fight with Gunk. Maybe we could do a fade transition like in the movie where the  fight ends with the blood and we see this scene? We'll workshop it. Duncan ran his hand over a golden revolver powered by a dwarven  crystal. An ancient steampunk ass lookin weapon that had been given to him a long long time ago for saving a friend. His best friend, Gunk.

CLICK CLICK Duncan opened the crystal chamber and closed it powering up the device. He then stuck it in his front pocket of his leather duster and headed out.

"HEY BOSS" a dog henchman said. "There's some humy here to see you. Says he's friends with Pizza"

"Must be here to pay up" Krinkles said "Let him in"

Then slow motion happened as Duncan slow mo cool walked through the hide out of the Woofers. His duster billowing in the wind even though they were inside. Maybe the woofers had a wind machinen or maybe after years of being the coolest mother fucker in  Grall the wind just followed Duncan around.

"You must be Duncan" Krinkles said as he licked his own butthole just out in the open. It pays to be the king.

"I'm here for the kid" Duncan said matter of factly. His eyes scanned the room as he took stock of how many people he would have to kill in order to get out of this mess with as little maimed body parts as possible. His head was held low as his hands were in the pockets of his duster. 

The dogmen all laughed and giggled.

"Is that so" Krinkles said laughing. "Were's our gold?"


"No gold" Duncan said to a now hushed crowd.

"Well....thats unfortunate" Krinkles said  slowly raising his head from his own crotch. He was deadly serious now. "Boys show this Humy what we do with pups who are disobedient" 

As the henchdogs drew closer Duncan threw back his duster and raised his dwarven revolver. On the side in dwarven runes read the name "Reckoning".

The dogmen stopped in their tracks not knowing what they were looking at. Each began to laugh as they again began to draw in closer to Duncan. Sensing this Duncan let of a single round into one of the dogmen's legs. The group stopped dead iin their tracks as the shot dogman yelped and cried and cowered under a table.

Duncan trainend the weapons sights on Krinkles who was now mouth agape at what he had just seen. 

"Wait...we can make a deal" Krinkles said in desperation.

"I don't think I feel like making a deal anymore" Duncan said cooly as he cocked the weapon.

"Wait...wait Duncan we can make a deal I swear lets just...

"Call me Deadeye" Duncan said as  he pulled the trigger sending a bolt of energy straight at Krinkles hitting him right in the eye. The bolt passed through his brain case and splattered out the back causing a hail storm of blood and bone and brain to splatter his Sex Walkers who were still holding his leash. They screamed and held their  hands up in disgust as they ran.

Ducan pointed the gun at the henchmen and begain to scan the room.

"Anyone else need to be put down?" He said with a quiet calm. Little Caeser Pizza quickly ran up to Duncan with awe on his face. He held out his cuffed hands as Duncan used 2 quick hand movements to pick the locks and free him.

"Lets go kid" He said as he picked him up and slung him onto his back "Hold on we're  getting out of here"

FIN
