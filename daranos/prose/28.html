<p>
	The Seven Stabmurai
</p>
<p>
	 The waves slowly beat against the shore as Squib let out a lengthy "GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASP" then took a deep breath and "GAAAAAASP"
</p>
<p>
	"Alright alright there little mutant" Reeses said patting him on the back.
</p>
<p>
	"Did they...did they do the season recap? Can I breath again?" Squib said looking around.
</p>
<p>
	"They did that last week" Reeses replied. "Oh man it was so funny like they recapped a bunch of things that didn't even happen in the episode. I was laughing so hard from the other room when they were recording. Classic Storylords". Reeses said to complete silence and confusion.
</p>
<p>
	"M...Mom?" Demi stuttered as she looked up to see an angelic figure looking down at her. She horked up a few lung fulls of sea water like yo mama did last night with my very own salty brine. Ugla sat her up and patted her back.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm not your mom kid" She said patting her making sure all the sea weed and crap was puked out.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh" Demi rubbed her eyes. "I'm sorry you just...you looked like her. She was beautiful too. But she didn't have a beard. I dont think. I dont really know though since all I have is this drawing of her that my friend...." Demi patted around her potato sack. "WHere....WHERE'S my picture!?" She yelled.
</p>
<p>
	"You mean this" Squib said as he held up a drenched piece of parchment. As it hit the cool night air it crumbled and whithered away like a raging boner at the strip club when the bouncer comes barging in the private dance room and you think "oh shit am I gonna get bounced out of Cheerleaders twice in one week? Oh well at least the Eagles won. Go Birds"
</p>
<p>
	"NO, MOM" Demi yelled as she began to cry. She could have cried more salt than was just blorked up by her lungs. Maybe even more than was in the oceans themselves.
</p>
<p>
	Just then Buffcat began to do that cat thing where they are about to puke. (Cat barfing sounds). Finally after a lengthy and melodramtic amount of time he simply puked up this orange colored liquid followed by a whole fish followed by a boot followed by some gold coins followed by more orange liquid.
</p>
<p>
	"Buffcat..." Ugla said going over to him. She rubbed his face and held it in her hands and smooched his cutie head. "I thought you were dead"
</p>
<p>
	"Technically he's not alive" Reeses said trying on the puked up boot. "Remember this is like a liminal junction...uh.....dimensional gateway....astral......whatever I dont even really care"
</p>
<p>
	"What happened B?" Ugla said stand up and helping up her old friend.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew!" Buffcat replied.
</p>
<p>
	"Wow.....that's....that's a lot to take in all at once" Ugla said sitting down next to the muscley feline.
</p>
<p>
	"What....waht did he say?" Squib said confused.
</p>
<p>
	"You don't speak Catonese!?" Reeses questioned with surprise.
</p>
<p>
	"No...I only speak MANdarin. You know the language that all races of men speak" Squib said almost ashamedly. Is this joke in bad taste? If so make sure you send your emails to M Class Emails at MClassEmail.gmail.com. I'll make sure to read it when I'm over at yo mama's later. We'll make fun of you while I'm sliding in to her DM's. In this case DM stands for Dem Meats ya acronym addicted fucks.
</p>
<p>
	"So let me get this strait...." Ugla paused to think. "You were in the future. Or maybe the past? Or maybe another dimension...and this little girl helped you escape. And this future place was run by an evil Golden Lich Ghost Demon God? And then you went through another portal and came here?"
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" Buffcat said nodding and licking his foot and using it to clean his face.
</p>
<p>
	"Welp" Reese interrupted. "Now that you have everything you need little wizard it's time I send you back to the 'real world' in air quotes"
</p>
<p>
	"Wait what? You didn't give us shit! Dude I'm all for like wizardy vagueness but you're about as vague as that guy who did that thing that time and then was never heard from again"
</p>
<p>
	"You have all you need little one" Reeses said. "You have the child and this huge scary looking monster with whiskers and this Goblin guy who probably can do stuff like take an arrow for you if need be"
</p>
<p>
	Demi was still on her knees on the wet sand. She was numb. Where was she? Her only link to her life had just disintigrated in front of her. Who are these people. That cat is kind of cute but who the hell is this lady with the beard. And this guy....with the one boot on.
</p>
<p>
	"Alright alright" Reeses said. "To aid you on your journey I present you with these fine magical weapons and armor." He did a flourish with his hands as one tiny impotent spark shot out from his finger.
</p>
<p>
	"FIRST THUSLY I present to you little Potato Girl this potato sack cloak of uh....courage. Yes Courage." He again waved his hands and another magical potato sack cloaked Demi in a warm embrace. Did it give her courage? Is a placebo courage? Who knows. 
</p>
<p>
	Demi stood up and felt the rough burlap of the cloak. As she ran her hand down the cloaks edge it becaame smooth and comforting. Like a fleece blanket in winter or like your mama's velvet lap lipse in the warm spring dew. Dew spelled like "DO" like "I'mma do her".
</p>
<p>
	"And for you Cat Man. I gift you the fabled Axe of the Glen. My friend Glen left it here and its been sitting in my lost and found for eons." Reeses then held out an enourmous battle axe with a leather hilt and gems of saphire. 
</p>
<p>
	Ugla sighed impatiently and rolled her eyes.
</p>
<p>
	"What...what about me Mr The Wize" Squib said looking up with puppy dog eyes. "Got any more fancy axes or burlap for me?"
</p>
<p>
	"Uhhhhhhhhh....sure.......for you little Squid"
</p>
<p>
	"Squib sir"
</p>
<p>
	"For you little Squidstir. I gift you this Crossbow of Infinite Ammo. It never runs out of bolts and it probably does other things too but I didn't read the manual because fuck that lemme shoot some stuff. But if you unlock its secrets it may serve you well. Maybe at one point even becoming a mcguffin that gets you and your friends out of a tough jam. But I mean it has infinite ammo so thats like ....really OP if you ask me."
</p>
<p>
	"Alright alright enough dilly dallying you have a realm to save" Reeses said. "Let me just go inside and get my Trans Dimentional Quantum Calibration Self Transducing Worm Hole Generator or 'MAGIC PORTAL NECKLACE' for all you DnD dorks out there"
</p>
<p>
	Reeses waved his hands and held out a silver Trans Dimentional Dimentional Quantum Calibration Self Transducing Worm Hole Generator. As he did a magical portal back to Daranos appeared. Buffcat and Squib began to walk through but as Ugla crossed the theshold she looked back at Demi.
</p>
<p>
	"You coming with, kiddo or you want to stay here with Grandpa Dunster"
</p>
<p>
	Demi looked up to see the portals magic glistening around Ugla. She could barely make out Ugla's face but she saw her eyes. In them she felt calmness. She felt safety. She stood up and gripped her cloak. With all the courage she could muster she took one step then another and then another until she got to Ugla. She held out her hand and grabbed Ugla's. 
</p>
<p>
	"Lets go" Demi finally said as they stepped into their fate.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla woke up and used her staff to help herself up. She rubbed her head. She had a splitting migraine like she was at Cheerleaders after the Eagles game and drank too many Belly Button Tequilas. She looked around to take stock of where they had landed. Maybe even when they had landed. Then she noticed it
</p>
<p>
	"Where's the kid?" She said to Squib who was dusting himself off even though UGla was pretty sure he was made of dirt entirely.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" Buffcat said doing that cat head shake thing.
</p>
<p>
	"KID!" Ugla shouted. "KID! WHERE ARE YOU"
</p>
<p>
	"QUIET DOWN THERE TALL AND uh...BEARDY!" A voice said from the bushes. Soon a group of pitch forks were pointing at Ugla.
</p>
<p>
	"I think I pooped pants" Squib said pulling his pantaloons out and looking down them to check. "Nope.....not my poop.....wheew"
</p>
<p>
	Demi woke up along side of a dusty road. The sun hit her face for the first time ever. She looked up squinting. She was in awe. What could be this beautiful and make this much light? AAND IT WAS WARM?!?!? 
</p>
<p>
	"This place is wild" she said to herself. Suddenly she heard a WHIP CRACK and a scream. She ducked down low and hid behind some bushes and a rock. Slowly she crept her way along the road side until she saw a squadron of golden armored men whipping a bunch of other men in a cage. The cage hung from a tree limb and the men shouted and skipped about inside as the whip cracked all around them.
</p>
<p>
	"Please sirs" said an elderly elf. "We ain't got no more gold nor do we ain't got no more food. And last time you raided our village you took all of our porno scrolls." The man pleaded with the knights. Demi ducked down as one knight turned toward her direction.
</p>
<p>
	"Well then..." The Knight said with a gravely voice. "We'll just have to go raid Farm Town again!" At this his men shouted and banged their sheilds against the swords.
</p>
<p>
	"Please sir....."the elf groveled. "We ain't got nothing left....."he cried and sunk back into the cage.
</p>
<p>
	"The Paladins of Daranos will be the judge of that!" Said the Knight.
</p>
<p>
	Demi had seen this before. Those with even the tiniest amount of power and the tiniest amount of dick lenght always wound up taking from those who were 'weak'. She grit her teeth as a rage shot through her bones. 
</p>
<p>
	"LET THEM GO" She yelled as she jumped out of the bushes.
</p>
<p>
	The PoD's stood in silence. ANd then one by one they all began to laugh.
</p>
<p>
	"Well well well what do we have here" The Leader PoD said pulling a glistening jewel studded gold hilted sword from it's scabbard.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm....." Demi looked down the length of the sword and suddenly this seemed like a shitty bad idea. But she gulped and swallowed her fear like I swallowed your dad's lap lossenge last night. What? YOu thought this was just about yo mama? Shit I'mma set out to ruin your whole god damn life. Buckle up you're gonna need several decades of therapy after I'm done with you.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm...." Demi gripped her cloak. "I'm the....POTATO KNIGHT" she said proundly.
</p>
<p>
	The PoD's again fell silent and again burst out in raucus laughter. "Oooo you better watch out Serg" One POD Lacky said.
</p>
<p>
	"Alright Potato Princess. In the cage you go along with Sad Old Elf Knight, Orc with Ugly Face Knight, and Gelatanous Cube Knight" The Sergent said as he through Demi into the cage. She hit the Gelatanous Cube with a thud as it let out a BELCH.
</p>
<p>
	"Just stay quiet little one" The old elf said. "And pay no mind to Jelly here. He's harmless."
</p>
<p>
	"ALRIGHT BOYS WE'RE HEADED OUT!" The Sergent yelled. As he did a wagon drawn by 8 horses began to pull away and pulled the hanging cage with it. 
</p>
<p>
	"So let me get this straight" Ugla said sipping a mug of dirt water that the locals called "beer". "You want us....to help you defend this village...."
</p>
<p>
	"Farm Town" said a Kobold wearing a top hat.
</p>
<p>
	"You want us to defend 'Farm Town'....from  a bunch of crooked Paladins who have been raiding your village of Gold, food and Porno Mags?"
</p>
<p>
	"Yup tahts the gist of it" Said an Orc Farmer sitting across the bar.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" Buffcat interjected.
</p>
<p>
	"We can't defend the town ourselves!" Said the Orc Farmer. "We could barely even name this town. Farm Town. Took us 4 weeks to come up with that. We're farmers. We don't do thinking and fighting and all that fancy hoo ha. Thats why we name things real literally like Water Hole and Side Walk and Big Yard Fork" The Farmer said as he banged his rake against the floor boards.
</p>
<p>
	"You can fight back" Ugla said. "With our help you can and will fight back"
</p>
<p>
	"BOOOOO" shouted a cowardly farmer as he hid behind a stool.
</p>
<p>
	"You can do whatever you set your minds to!" Ugla said standing up holding up her mug. "Shit. Orc Farmer you can defend your family! And you...Elf Farmer you can defend your land! And even you Rat Faced Farmer With A Dog's Body and Eczema and Looks Like You Don't Brush Your Teeth Too Often, You can defend your whatever you love. Probably cheese or something."
</p>
<p>
	"Awwww" Said the farmer. "I'm a regular human. I'm just reaaaaaaal ugly like"
</p>
<p>
	"Tomorrow. First light. We're gonna train you dingus farmers to fight back." Ugla said sipping the last of her drink and slamming the mug down into the ground.
</p>
<p>
	"Booooo that was my mom's mug Boooooo" 
</p>
<p>
	The next day as the sun's first light peaked through the tree leaves, Buffcat had assembled a rag tag bumpkin brigade in front of Farm Town's Water Hole and Main Side Walk.
</p>
<p>
	"MEW  MEW MEW MEW" HE commanded as they each tried to wield their Big Yard Forks around in variouis offensive and defensive formations.
</p>
<p>
	"Meeewww" Buffcat sighed as he rubbed his nose.
</p>
<p>
	"Alright you pukes" Squib said as he puffed on a corn cob pipe and wore a generals hat and aviator sunglasses. "You're gonna shoot these bows and arrows like your tiny pathetic puke lives depend on it because they do!"
</p>
<p>
	"Yes SIR" said one Farm Boy at attention.
</p>
<p>
	"THATS GENERAL ADMIRAL COMMANDANT SIR TO YOU PUKE!" Squib yelled directly at the boys knee caps. "WHERE YOU FROM BOY!"
</p>
<p>
	"Uh....Farm Town General Admiral....Guy Sir!"
</p>
<p>
	"FARMTOWN HUH! I DIDN'T KNOW THEY STACKED POOP THAT HIGH IN FARM TOWN"
</p>
<p>
	Later that evening.
</p>
<p>
	"This....is a disaster" Ugla said slamming another dirt beer into her mouth.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" Buffcat agreed drinking his Milk Cocktail.
</p>
<p>
	"We gotta find that kid too" UGla said
</p>
<p>
	The next few days were filled with more training. Squib had upgraded his rank to Dictator for Life  and given himself every award for valor Daranos could give out. They were mostly just bottle caps and ribbons he found in the trash.
</p>
<p>
	"ATTENTION FARM TOWN" boomed over an all talk stone. "This is Sergent Thadius Knuckledeep of the Paladins of Daranos. Please line up in an orderly fashion for the weekly tribute and extortion drive. Please refrain from giving us anymore MILF porn as we all know that being 35 in this era is actually considered GMILF porn and frankly I've moved onto the whole step sibling fantasy genre"
</p>
<p>
	A horse drawn wagon pulled up with Sergant Knuckledeep on the back along with a cage full of prisoners. Ugla along with everyone else in Farm Town exited their living cubes and looked on in fear at their weekly tormentors.
</p>
<p>
	"KID" Ugla shouted as she saw Demi in the cage. Demi saw her but then looked away in anger.
</p>
<p>
	"Kid." Ugla said telepathically using probably magic. "We're gonna get you out of here."
</p>
<p>
	Demi looked at Ugla right in the eyes and thought "Wow thanks for giving a crap like you care"
</p>
<p>
	Ugla felt shame. "Look kid...I"
</p>
<p>
	"THIS LINE IS FOR PORN THAT IS ABOUT CLOTHED MALE NUDE FEMALE" a POD said berating a farmer. "THIS IS CLEARLY CLOTHED FEMALE NUDE MALE"
</p>
<p>
	"Just....sit tight kid" Ugla thought. "FARMERS OF FARM TOWN" Ugla shouted. "RISE UPPPPPPPP" and with that all fuckin farm hell broke loose.
</p>
<p>
	Farmers reached into hay piles and pulled out Big Yard Forks and Shovels. One guy even made a bazooka out of some old pipes he found in the woods and was shooting black powder balls out of it and it was making that cool "THOOOMP" noise from Terminator 2 or when Darth Vader puts his helmet back on.
</p>
<p>
	The PoDs were taken completely off guard. Sergent Knuckledeep unsheethed his sword and began to hack at anything that looked dirty enough to be a poor. He struck down Elf Farmer and then killed a Dwarf Farmer. The blood on his sword dripped down into the dusty town square as he seethed with anger.
</p>
<p>
	"YOU BACKWARD ASS FARM ASS HILLBILLY ASS YOKELS" he shouted as he dragged his sword on the ground and raised it up just in time to block a rake from striking him. He parried the blow and swung around holding the sword at his side sliding in the ribs of another Orc Farmer.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla unsheathed Sandals and began to hack away at the troops. She was surrounded by 3 PoDs who were laughing as they approched. Thinking they outnumbered the wizard their overconfindence would be the last thing that went through their brains. Well second to last thing as Ugla's Catana sliced one dude's face clean off. Like literally like that movie Face Off, she cut downward and you could like see his eye sockets and tonuge and stuff. It was so fucked up. Its probably on LiveLeak it was so fucked up.
</p>
<p>
	"C'mon" Demi said to her cellmates. "We gotta get out of here. Jelly...can you hoark up that fork in please?"
</p>
<p>
	Jelly began to dry heave and slowly a fork that was digesting inside fo his goo began to rise to the surface. With one last ACCKUM the fork spat out sizzling on the cage floor.
</p>
<p>
	"Thank you Jelly" Demi said as she began to pick the locks of their shackles with the fork.
</p>
<p>
	"FIIIIIIRE" Squib said as his archers fired in unicen a volley of arrows from atop the barns and homes of the people of Farm Town. It almost brought a tear to his eye to see his troops fight this hard for their supreme dictator god emporer. If only tears weren't the ultimate sign of liberal weakness invented by the lying liberal media, he thought.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly a flail flew up and hit Farm Boy right in the face caving in half of his homely visage.
</p>
<p>
	"FARM BOY NOOOOOOO" Squib shouted as he ran over to the raw recruit.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm......sorry....."Farm Boy said as he coughed up blackened blood from the gaping wound in his face. He struggled to get out his final words as the blood pooled down into his trachea. "DId....did I do good Admiral General Sir?" he said as the dull brown of his eyes gave way to stillness and a death rattle.
</p>
<p>
	"You....did good Farm boy." Squib said sobbing. He took of a bottle cap and ribbon from his generals coat and pinned it on Farm Boy. "You did real good".
</p>
<p>
	"Got it" Demi said as each and every chain rattled loose including the one that was around Jelly. Well it was more inside of Jelly being digested but it opened none the less. Demi opened the cage door and helped Old Elf Farmer out. Orc Farmer was next and he ran off to grab a weapon to use against the invaders. Jelly slorped out after them all and glorped his way behind some barrels to safety. Demi looked across the town square and saw Sergent Dickknuckle slaughtering farmers left and right. Ugla was to his left finishing off the last of her attackers. She used Sandals to hack through the soldiers own sword and then kicked his knee out from under him breaking it like Joe THeiseman style. As he fell to the ground in agony Ugla raised Sandals and cleaved the soldier in half from shoulder to hip. 
</p>
<p>
	Just then a Gnome farmer on a rickety old hog of a boner cycle revved through the town center. In the side car was Squib with his crossbow firing off shot after shot still wearing the aviators but ditching his generalissimo hat for a red do rag. 
</p>
<p>
	"SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND" He said as he shot bolt after bolt. "Her name is Claire and she let me ride her bonercycle AHHHHHHHHH" he shouted killing a few PoDs
</p>
<p>
	"Hi I'm claire" the gnome said waving and then running over a Paladin. She then did a breaky over his face and let the ass end of the hog slam down onto his peener. Then she did a burn out on his peener until it caught fire from the friction. Some say that to this day when the moon is full you can still hear the scream of a disembodied peener in that very town center. Yelling out in agony acompanied by the smell of burning peener flesh and bone rubber.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" Buffcat said as he ran behind a barn. 2 Paladins gave chase but as they turned the corner to the back of the building a hulking monster of a buff creature began to rise up. It towered over them as they dropped their spears and pissed pants. Buffcat grabbed the battle axe on his back and with one hand threw it at both Paladins. It hit the one and split him in twain. His legs fell before his torso as his upper body hung in the air for a second spilling his intestines out onto the ground. The axe didn't stop there though. It continued on its trajectory cutting down tree after tree after tree. 
</p>
<p>
	"Meeeeww" Buffcat said in awe.
</p>
<p>
	"Awww kitty cat what you gonna do now that you don't have your axe?" Mocked the other Paladin but Buffcat just held up his paw. As the Paladin approached spear at the ready he never saw it coming. The axe returned Captain America style cleaving a path right through the paladins head. Buffcat caught it smoothly and only said "MEW"
</p>
<p>
	"YOU'RE WELCOME BUFFCAT GLEN GHOST AWWAAAAAAAY" said a ghostly apprition that flew back into the axe.
</p>
<p>
	"ENOUGH" Sergent Knuckledeep shouted. As he did he pulled Demi by the hair and held his sword to her throat. 
</p>
<p>
	The town went quiet. Ugla flipped Sandals around as blood sprayed off her blade onto the dust. "STOP right there she witch" he said.
</p>
<p>
	"Let her go Shit Bag" Ugla said. "You don't deserve to wear that armor nor do you deserve to wield a flame sword."
</p>
<p>
	"HAHAHAHA Flame sword?" Sergent laughed. "This is Crucifist." He held the sword up high. Its gems glistened in the light. "I have used this sword to carve my way through Daranos taking what I want when I want. THere is no law anymore. There is no order. Only power"
</p>
<p>
	"That" Ugla interupted. "Is a flame sword. No wonder you don't know that though. Flame Swords only work for those pure of heart and true to justice and helping others."
</p>
<p>
	"ENOUGH WOMAN WENCH BITCH GIRL" said Knuckledeep holding the sword to Demi's throat. "I'm going to kill this child if you don't give us what we want"
</p>
<p>
	"You better let her go before I go back in time and cut your dad's nuts off so that you'll never be born or like you'll be born a different person. Maybe even a liberal person."
</p>
<p>
	"SILENCE" Knuckledeep said as he kicked Demi out in front of him. Raising his sword he beared down on the helpless child and then CLANG.
</p>
<p>
	Sandals' blade rattled in Demi's ears as the metal on metal vibrated through her skull inches from her head. With an artful twist Ugla shot the Paladin's sword up into the air, while spinning around and lopping off his sword arm.
</p>
<p>
	"YOU LIBERAL CUCK" Shouted Knuckledeep. Blood shot from his arm Yojimbo style. As the sword fell back down to earth Demi grabbed it. Perfectly. Like she was destined to be there.
</p>
<p>
	As she gripped the handle she felt heat. Then she felt the smooth rush of power surge up the blade. And then BOOOOOSH. The blade ignited. 
</p>
<p>
	The Farmers gasped as Demi held the sword up high. She looked at it squinting at its bright magnificence. 
</p>
<p>
	"Do it kid" Ugla said nodding at Demi.
</p>
<p>
	"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" Demi screamed a righteous scream and plunged the flame sword into the Paladins chest plate. It's heat pierced teh armor easily. As teh Sergent gurlgled his last Demi flipped her hair out of her face and looked into his eyes. Fear. He was terrified. But she wasn't. She was.....justice.
</p>
<p>
	"UGGHHGHHALJLKJSDFSDL" the Sergent shouted as the flame sword began to cook him from the inside out. Encased in armor the heat began to built up to a red hot glow. The flames rose up from under his armored collar to engulf his face until all the flesh and corruption was literally burned away leaving only dust and ash. 
</p>
<p>
	"ohhhhh fuck CHEESE IT" The other Paladins said as they scattered.
</p>
<p>
	"YOOOOOOO someone cookin bacon out here GAT DAMN" Orc Farmer said as he walked over to what was left of the Sergent. "Oink Oink mother fuck" he said as he drew his boot down onto the skull of the Sergent crushing it into the dirt. Dust to dust mother fuck.
</p>
<p>
	As Ugla, Squib, Buffcat and Demi waved goodbye to Farm Town as they set off down the dirt path. Along the road birds chirped and Mirkmunks fucked their wives. Demi breathed it all in. So much green.
</p>
<p>
	"Hey kid...." Ugla said kneeling down. "I uh....I really screwed up. I've been so focused on everything else like saving the world and Reeses's dumb fuckin shit that I forgot the real important stuff. Helping others."
</p>
<p>
	Demi looked down at her new flame sword. "It's ok. I shouldn't have tried to save those Farmers by myself without at least a knife or like maybe a laser gun or something if they've been invented yet."
</p>
<p>
	"So what're you going to name your sword?" Ugla asked.
</p>
<p>
	"Hmmmmm" Demi thought. "Cynthia"
</p>
<p>
	"Cynthia?" Squib said turning around. 
</p>
<p>
	"It was my mom's name" Demi said.
</p>
<p>
	"Cynthia is a fine name for a sword" Ugla said patting Demi on hte shoulder. 
</p>
<p>
	"Alright we're going home boys" Ugla said turning around.
</p>
<p>
	"Where's home?" Demi asked.
</p>
<p>
	"Graal""TacoBell" Squib and ugla said simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
	"Yes....Graal is what I was saying too" Squib said looking around innocently.
</p>
<p>
	As the others pressed forward down the road Demi slowly opened her pack.
</p>
<p>
	"Meep Meep meep" a tiny gelatanous cube said jiggling with excitement.
</p>
<p>
	"Shhhhh Jelly you're gonna get us in trouble" Demi said patting the small cube on the head.
</p>
<p>
	FIN
</p>
