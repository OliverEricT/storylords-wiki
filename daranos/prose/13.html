	Mantch and the Tower of Zaranos
</p>
<p>
		Metal clanged as Fred and Gunk slammed their drinking steins together so hard frothy mead spilled out onto the wooden table stained from a thousand drinks and god fuckin knows what else. Probably a whole lotta #3. Fred slammed back his peronally engraved drinking stein that read "Who's Ur Daddy" with a picture of a hot Orc with a steak between them cheeks like that sun tan lotion girl. He had won it from a Daranos Steak House and it was a limited edition which made it amongst the top 3 most valuable and enchanted objects in the entire realm.
</p>
<p>
	"BEAT YA" Gunk said as he slammed down his mug. A cheer rose up from the crowd that had gathered around to watch this amazing demonstration of athleticism that was binge drinking until you almost die. But to his astonishment Fred had already moved on to a SECOND drink and was slamming that down and instead of a mug he was using an enchanted teapot that some wizard had turned alive. While Fred supped from the teapots spout the Teapot was just twerkin and booty jigglin' and Gunk was pretty sure that his spout was also his peener?
</p>
<p>
	The crowd roared as the party was reaching Richter Scale levels of epic. Gunk did a spit take as he was now SURE that the spout of the teapot was a peen because he didn't think it was meade comming out anymore. 
</p>
<p>
	"Talk about a lot of HEAD am I right" Peppercorn said as he dipped in and out of conciousness having one too many dixie cups full of Elven Nipple Necter. Some people say that's a girls drink but if that's a girls drink then consider me Nancy Reagan.
</p>
<p>
	"FRED" Duncan yelled over the crowd. He was carring a new round for the table as he bobbed and weaved through the patrons trying not to spill a precious drop of malt beer. As he reached his seat he placed the round on the thick wooden slab. Not to be outdone Gunk immediate grabbed for another mug and began drinking like a college freshman on the last night of spring break and he/she had only seen 1 whole tiddy the entire time!
</p>
<p>
	"Fred" Duncan went on. "Regail us with a tale of your legendary exploits my good man" Duncan picked up a drink and klinked it against Fred's mug.
</p>
<p>
	"Aw I dont know all my stories are boring. Plus I'm not really good at stories you know like telling them? I'm more like 'Situationally Funny'" Fred said as he looked into his empty mug.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh C'mon Freddo" Chic Pea said. "You like have to tell us a good story so we can like...listen to it or whatever it is we do on this show"
</p>
<p>
	Gunk slammed down his now empty mug and began to chant "STORY STORY STORY STORY" as the rest of the crew joined in and so did the teapot. "story story story" in his little teapot voice.
</p>
<p>
	"Alright alright" Fred relented. "But if I'm going to tell you a story Daddy's gonna need more 'Story Juice'" and witih this Fred held his empty mug up as someone poured something into it. It didn't even matter anymore.
</p>
<p>
	"This happened oh about 5 years ago....." As Fred trailed off the words 5 Years ago were scrolled on the screen as the camera panned down to an empty desolate desert. Heat rippled off of the sands which were white and chalky. Heat also rippled off of Fred's pure cut cum gutters and glistening chest. If there was any moisture in this desert it surely was from your mama who would have PROBABLY said "BOYS don't come home tonight because its so hot in my nethers that Mama's gonna have a clam bake down at the Seafood Panties if ya know what I mean"
</p>
<p>
	Fred stumbled along in the sweltering wilderness as days became weeks. He had long since run out of food and the only water he had left was a tiny droplet of Dragon's Sweat which works kind of like Lembas Bread but is totally an original idea and not something I stole. ANYWAY as Fred lifted the remaining vile of Dragon's Sweat to his mouth he found no cooling sensation hit his tongue.
</p>
<p>
	"Well...thats taht I guess " He said as he plodded along. Holding his hand up to his face to block his eyes from the suns Fred looked in all directions. There was nothing. Absolutly fuck all zilcho nothing. Sand covered his body. Sand was in his beard and in his eyes. He could feel the grit wearing away at the layer of moist gelatin that was suppoded to keep his eyes fresh and working. He coughed and could have sworn he coughed up some sand. Impossible to tell since there was sand everywhere and he was now pretty sure he was actually going insane from thirst.
</p>
<p>
	After another day and night, which was still really  hot because in this fantasy ass desert its just hot all the time I dont have to follow the rules of real science thats why I chose fantasy you can do whatever god damn fuck you want.
</p>
<p>
	After another day and night Fred was sure he was going to die. He fell forward as his face burried into the hot sand. His brain was dry. For a moment he thought about drinking the sand. Oh what he would give to have that be sufficient to quench his thirst. Even though he hated sand he would drinkn a gallon of it and endure its grit just to feel satiated. Hell he'd drink FIRE and let it burn his lungs if he could just feel not thirsty. His tongue touched the sands. At least he thought it did since he could no longer feel it. It was so dry. There had to be another word for this amount of dry, he thought to himself. Desicated was good. Perhaps withered? What did it matter he was going to die out here.
</p>
<p>
	He began to close his eyes...everything grew darker and darker.
</p>
<p>
	(SOUND A LOUD HORN)
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly Fred shot up. All around him was yelling and screaming and the sound of bone cars and bonercycles just revin like this was Fast and the Furiouis 69: A Fast Christmas rated NC-17.
</p>
<p>
	"GRAB EM BOYS" A fuckin ripped ass lizard man said as he flung one of those nets out like they do in like Planet of the Apes. 
</p>
<p>
	"How do you learn how to throw a net like that? Is it from fishing" Fred thought to himself pretty sure he was dead at this point and  none of this was actually happening. As the net hit him the weighted ends, which normally wouldn't be no thang for Fred's muscles, were just enough to keep him pinned to the ground.  Dust and sand blew everywhere as it seemed a dozen hootin and hollerin weirdos were just doing donuts around him. They were yee hawwin and shit something fierce. Fred peared out of the net holes and through the sand and detritis he could see a motley crew of all kinds of fucked up weirdos. 
</p>
<p>
	There were bug men, Ants by the looks of them. He saw a lizard man. He saw a guy with a scoropion tail and a scorpion with a guy for tail like some kind of Master Blaster-esque mutated desert chimera. There  was even a Poodle Man? Alright sure why not. There was even a double headed lizard man which like...was that a thing that was normal for lizard people or like was it some kind of genetic thing? Fred thought he better not draw attention to it if he were to talk to them because they might be sensitive about the whole thing. Did he accidetnly stumble into Burning Man, Fred thought to himself. 
</p>
<p>
	"GRAB THAT MEAT BOYS" One of the giant Ant men said as he spoke pretty good  Daranosian for not having a mouth but like huge mandibles.
</p>
<p>
	"YEE HAW" said the Double Lizard Man as he his other head giggled like an idiot. Soon Fred The Skullpeeler, legendary steak daddy and self proclaimed "Rage Artisan" was being dragged along the dirt like some kind of helpless weak mama's boy baby who needed a suckle from his wet nurse's teets.
</p>
<p>
	"Fuck this sucks" he said.
</p>
<p>
	"QUIET KURRR" the ant man said as he prodded Fred's side with a blazing hot brand. It left a burning "SD".
</p>
<p>
	"Heh thats coincidental" Fred said. "Hey this wouldn't happen to be BURNING MAN would it?"  but before Fred could finish a swift boot hit his jaw knocking him out like a 3rd grader in an MMA fight.
</p>
<p>
	As Fred awoke he sat up with a start. All around him was food and wine and water and dancing  half naked hotties and dude hotties just gyrating their flesh meats. Ok NOW he was SURE he was dead.
</p>
<p>
	He raised  his arms and checked to see if he was chained down or strapped in. Was this some kind of torture? No...he was free to move. As he did a sexy cat lady whipped her tail under his nose and held out a thingy of grapes for Fred to eat. What are those things called? Satchel of Grapes. Bunch of Grapes? If I say "Bunch" it sounds lazy like I'm not good at describing stuff there h as to be a better word for the things that grapes come on.
</p>
<p>
	Fred plucked a grape from the grape thingy and bit into it. As the juice ruptured into his mouth it was like Orc Jesus jizzed a thousand communions into his soul. He tasted the sweet and watery liquid and devoured the entire thingy of grapes. 
</p>
<p>
	He then poured wine and water into 2 mugs and began double fisting them things like he was over at your mama's house last night double fisting her grape juice box. Music played as he ate until he felt like he was going to die. As he layed back in his seat the delicate sound of a jingle bell rang out. Quickly the dancers and waiters all scurried away. The room was empty.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm glad you enjoyed the meal" A sleek and smooth voice echoed from the back of the chamber from behind.
</p>
<p>
	Fred turned to see one of the Red Ant Men dresssed in a shiny robe of what looked like spider's silk. It was fancy. As he walked he rubbed his four hands together.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah thanks for the save out there" Fred said letting out a 10/10 burp that would have won an award in any of the more civilized regions of Daranos.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh its no trouble at all my friend" The Ant Man said sidling up from behind. He used one of his 4 ant arms to grab a single sugar crumb of honey bread off the table and oddly pocketed it.
</p>
<p>
	"So uh...What is this place?" Fred said looking up into the high vaulted cieling of the enormous bangquet hall he found himself in.
</p>
<p>
	"This is Zaranos Tower and I am Scrabble Dant, the duly elected leader and monarch of the tower"
</p>
<p>
	"Zaranos Tower...thats pretty original" Fred said laughing. Scrabble Dant did not laugh with him.
</p>
<p>
	"I guess that makes you the PREZI-DANT" Fred said doubling down on the joke hoping to get a  laugh this time.
</p>
<p>
	'Indeed" Scrabble Dant said as he sat  in one of the empty chairs at the table near enough to Fred to speak to him but far enough away to be kind of weird and creepy.
</p>
<p>
	"This place. This tower" Dant went on. "It is the culmination of all my people's hard work. You may have noticed the diverse group of beings here?" Dant questions. Fred thought about the Poodle Guy...what the fuck was up with that guy?
</p>
<p>
	"We aim only to live in harmony with each other and the world" Dant said as his mandibles awkwardly clanked against a glass as he drank some wine.
</p>
<p>
	"Well that sounds lovely but" 
</p>
<p>
	"What brings you out here?" Scrabble Dant interruped.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh you know..." Fred stalled as he was now getting creepy vibes from this giant ant man who could talk land drink wine out of a glass. "I heard the southern deserts were spectacular this time of year so here I am" He said as he held his hands out and shrugged.
</p>
<p>
	"Hmm" at this Scrabble Dant chuckled. "Well whatever the reason I'm sure you could use the rest. Please join us for dinner this evening" Dant clapped his four ant hands together and 2 super buff ant guards marched in holding spears which looked like they were made from an even bigger insect. Like maybe a DOUBLE ANT MAN?
</p>
<p>
	Fred understood the internation language of violence and threats and delicately dabbed his beard with a napkin and placed it down on the table.
</p>
<p>
	"Dinner it is then" He said staring Scrabble Dant in his compoud eyes.
</p>
<p>
	"Don't be late" Dant said with what Fred could only guess was the ant man version of a smirk.
</p>
<p>
	The two ant guards  shoved Fred into a dank and dark dungeon. They had ridden a rope lift a long ways down. 
</p>
<p>
	"How big is this place?" Fred asked one of the ant guards only to be met with the response of "CRACKLE CAKCL CKLALCLCLCLALCL"
</p>
<p>
	"Well...that answers that" he said.
</p>
<p>
	As he hit the floor of the dungeon he heard a cackle of unhinged laughter spread throughout the dark. He was not alone down here and whoever was unfortunate enough to be stuck down here probaby had been down here for a LONG time. The place smelled of urine and feces probably from people pissing and poopin pants because dungeons are scary. Fred pulled himself along the floor and leaned his still aching and dtired body against the cold stone wall. It actually felt good except for the whole being in a piss and shit infested prison.
</p>
<p>
	Slowly Fred's eyes grew acustom to the darkesss and he began to be able to make out shapes of huminods in the low light. As he turned he saw a skeleton chained against the wall. 
</p>
<p>
	"First time" a low voice said from his left. Fred quickly moved to look to see who was speaking.
</p>
<p>
	"Right here" the voice said. As he leaned into some dim light coming through an air hole in teh wall. It was another Ant Man. A black Ant Man.
</p>
<p>
	"What're you in for" Fred said with a laugh.
</p>
<p>
	"Sedition and insiting revolution against the tyrranical KING Scrabbles Dant" Said the Ant Man spitting on the floor.
</p>
<p>
	"I thought he was elected" Fred said sarcastically.
</p>
<p>
	"Maaaaaaan this place is a CULT dude" Said the ant. "They threw your ass down in here with the rest of us and what did diyou do?"
</p>
<p>
	"Almost died in the desert" Fred said.
</p>
<p>
	"Names Mantch" The ant man said holding out a hand for Fred to shake only to hear a CLANG of his chains when he reached too far.  "Why were you in the desert in the first place?"
</p>
<p>
	"I was.....looking for a friend..." Fred trailed off.
</p>
<p>
	"These cultists man...They're always talkin about harmony and all that nonsense but did you see the crazy bone cars they drive? That is a straight up 1950's style post apocolyptic bike and car gang dude. Plus I knowk for a fact they're planning something. Something big" Mantch went on trying not to sound like a conspiracy theorist but he WAS a talking Ant.
</p>
<p>
	"Like what?" Fred opened the conversational door for Mantch to continue.
</p>
<p>
	"Like I said man this is a cult...and what do cults do?" Mantch let the question hang.
</p>
<p>
	"Orgies. I hope you're going to say orgies" Fred smiled.
</p>
<p>
	"Pssssshhh" Manch laughed. "You're funny human guy. But no....not unless everyoneo dies at the end of your orgies?"
</p>
<p>
	"Only on a bad night" Fred said. "So how do we escape?"
</p>
<p>
	"Well...."Mantch thought for a tick. "I'm pretty sure they're gonna eat you"
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah I got that feeling as well" Fred said as he pulled on the chains holding his hands together.
</p>
<p>
	"We've been ready to bust out of ohere for a spell" Mantch said in a whisper as he looked around.
</p>
<p>
	"We?" Fred asked.
</p>
<p>
	"You think I'm the only person in here who tried to espace? All I need from you is a distraction"
</p>
<p>
	"Ok but like they're going to eat me" Fred said raising an eyebrow and frowning.
</p>
<p>
	"If that works for you as a distraction sure I mean thanks for takin one for the team but you look like a smart guy I'm sure you'll think of something" Mantch finished.
</p>
<p>
	"How will I know when to signal you?" Fred asked.
</p>
<p>
	Mantch slowlly slid his bottom hands out of hte cuffs and undid the chains on the wall quietly placing them down against it. "I'm going to teach you the ancient ant technique of Pheramone Communication"
</p>
<p>
	"I can learn this?" Fred asked suspiciously
</p>
<p>
	"Sure dawg" Mantch said as he began to mediate. "Follow my lead"
</p>
<p>
	The two sat in silence for a bit until Mantch spoke again
</p>
<p>
	"Ya know they probably fed you human meat right?"
</p>
<p>
	CUT TO:
</p>
<p>
	The two red ant guards threw Fred down onto the hard cold floor of the same banquet hall that Fred had DEFINTELY NOT eaten human meat or so he was going to leave out of the story if he ever had to tell it to a group of friends at a bar after a night of heavy binge drinking.
</p>
<p>
	His human body thudded as it hit the ground. All around were more groups of beings. Most dressed in white robes with dried desert sticks on as crowns. Scrabbles Dant sat in a golden throne as a lute playing half naked snake lady slithered around and rattled her rattle tail in timei with the beat of her lute tune.
</p>
<p>
	"Ah Prezi-DANT" Fred said looking up. "When's dinner?"
</p>
<p>
	"Oh it has just arrived" Dant said crossings his hands. The crowd laughed.
</p>
<p>
	"NOW MY CHILDREN" Dant shouted raising his arms. "Tonight is the night we ascend. Tonight is the night we break free of our physical bonds and become GODS ourselves!" Dant shouted. Fred had heard all of othis before from a thousand cult leaders and many of them he  himself had ripped their spines from their bodies in an ironic fashion of course since most of them were spineless cowards.
</p>
<p>
	"Blah blah blah blah " Fred said laughing. "God your'e so lame. This whole cult thing man like what is this....the 6970's?" The crowd fell even more silent as one guy in the back laughed then quieted himselfl with a cough.
</p>
<p>
	"YOU will be the fuel that our bodies need to sustain us for the journey" Dant said as he clapped his hands together. Guards dragged Fred up onto ohis feet and put him on a rack.
</p>
<p>
	"NOW MY CHILDREN SUP UPON THIS HUMANS SWEET MEATS" Scrabbles YELLED AND RAISED  HIS ARMS TO THE HEAVENS.
</p>
<p>
	"Just one question" Fred said. "I thought you ants were ruled by a queen and not some physcotic cult of personality baby larva dick"
</p>
<p>
	The one guy in the back "OOOOOOOooo'd"
</p>
<p>
	"YOU LEAVE MOTHER OUT OF THIS" Scrabbles shouted. He was now enraged and began to throw off his white robe and knock over candle sticks and full blown temper tantrum it up.
</p>
<p>
	"I LEAD THOUSANDS OF BEINGS" He continued to shout as he got closer to Fred. "THOUSANDS OF BEINGS OF ALL TYPES. MOTHER ONLY COMMANDS ANTS BUT I LEAD MULTITUDES. I MEAN FUCK WE EVEN HAVE A POODLE GUY" Scrabbles pointed to the poodle guy in the back.
</p>
<p>
	"Uhhhh is there a vegetarian option because I was told there'd be a vegetarian option for our ascention into the death world or whatever" Poodle Guy said quietly from the back.
</p>
<p>
	"I AM THE KING HERE I AM THE QUEEN HERE I AM THE ONE HIVE MIND HERE" Scrabbles shouted.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah well" Fred looked him again in his compound eyes. "NOT MY PREZI-DANT" and with that he concentrated on his newly learned ant pheramone technique. And.....nothing.
</p>
<p>
	"What is that what are you doing...why does it smell like burnt hair and cat treats?" Scrabbles started sniffing around. "Oh...oh no" 
</p>
<p>
	Suddendly the walls began to shake. The floors rumbled as if a thousand angry bees had be let loose and the only thing standing in their way to freedom was the kid from My Girl and today as Fate would have it, he sure couldn't see without those glasses.
</p>
<p>
	Tapestries fell from the walls. Cult members began to panic. Some made out with each other others started stuffing food in their pockets like Poodle Guy. It was clear Poodle Guy was only here for the hor'duevres. The doors burst open to reveal a crowd of Ant Men and Lizard Men and Scorpion Guys and Snake Ladies and Cat people and you name it. All united together in escaping the hell that they had been imprisoned in. All united in this moment with only one goal...to get revenge on this death cult tyrant son of a brood bitch. 
</p>
<p>
	Mantch led the way as he split open an unsuspecting Scorpion man in half with a round house kick. Dude's kick game was THAT good. A snake lady threw a throwing star and it CLANGED against Fred's restraints setting him free. She then devoured a cultist whole. 
</p>
<p>
	"Looks like she's not a vegetarian" Fred said to himself.
</p>
<p>
	Scrabbles scrabbled to his throne as if somehow the symbol of its oppulence and power were enough to save him. He had imprisoned these people. Kidnapped them and imprisoned them and now no throne or amount of gold in all of hte realm was going to save him. Scrabbles held out a small dirk waving it wildly and clumsily at anyone who would get near him. He hissed in anger.
</p>
<p>
	Fred continued to walk toward Scrabbles as he felt a sucker punch to the jaw. It barely registered withi  him as he turned to see the punch thrower.
</p>
<p>
	"Poodle Man" Fred said sighing. "I"m gonna pretend you didn't just do that. Go home to your family man"
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah I kind of thought it was a bad idea half way through....I'm sorry"
</p>
<p>
	"Uh huh get going" Fred said patting  him on the head.
</p>
<p>
	Mantch and Fred now closed in on Scrabbles. He hissed and waved the dirk around inexpertly.
</p>
<p>
	"Nice tiny DIRK" Mantch said laughing.
</p>
<p>
	"Nice" Fred said going for the high five but was left hanging because maybe ants dont' do that? I dont know you'd think they would with all those hands.
</p>
<p>
	"Which one of you would DARE to kill a GOD" Scrabbles said in desperation.
</p>
<p>
	"I mean I'm cool with killing anyone who kidnaps me or imprissons me or tortures me or takes me away from my family or kills my friends or " Mantch went on for awhile.
</p>
<p>
	"Same" Fred interjected. "Hey Scrabbles ya know what htey call me back home?"
</p>
<p>
	"W-What?" Scrabbles said shakily.
</p>
<p>
	"The SKULLPEELER" 
</p>
<p>
	Mantch and Fred closed in on the cult leader as the giant doors began to close. All that was heard was a loud chittering scream as the light from inside the banquet room dimmed to a faint line and fell silent.
</p>
<p>
	"Whoooooooa" Duncan said rubbing his temples.
</p>
<p>
	"What happened to peoples of the Zigurat?" Gunk asked like a child listening to his favorite story.
</p>
<p>
	"Mantch led them and the peoples of the zigurat made it an oasis in the desert" Fred said sipping his meade.
</p>
<p>
	"So like...this wasn't a real story first of all..." Chic Pea hiccuped a rebuttle. "First of all how did he teach  you ancient ant pheramone techniques in a few hours?"
</p>
<p>
	"I'll show you" Fred said. And then he let rip the most epic fart anyone had ever heard. A few people went deaf and some puked. The crowd fell silent. Then one person began a slow clap until everyone was cheering and clapping.
</p>
<p>
	"You told that whole story just as a set up to fart joke?" Chic Pea yelled. 
</p>
<p>
	Fred shrugged and slammed therest of his drink "Not just a fart joke" he said gesturing to the door.
</p>
<p>
	As he did Mantch busted in and let out a similar loud squeaky ant fart that lit up the night's sky like a fire work.
</p>
<p>
	"A double fart joke" Fred said as he rose his mug to Mantch who winked before  heading over to his old friend.
</p>
