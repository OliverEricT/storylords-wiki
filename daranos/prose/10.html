	Daranosian nights are spooky scary sexy cool. TLC named an album after them and went triple Mithril. T-Bones, Left Orc, and Chile really hit it out of the park on that one. RIP Left Orc. One time I went out with a girl who really loved TLC and she left me chasin' waterfalls and by waterfalls I mean jizzfalls and by 'went out with a girl' I mean it was your sweet mama's lonely but firm booty of which I tapped and am now not, in fact, keepin' it on the 'down low'. And yes Chile is the same in your world is as Daranos.

Sid and Socks lay next to a crackling fire. Sparks popped and smacked in the cool night air as the wood burned. Don't worry, the wood didn't' belong to a TRENT. We're not at that story yet keep your fuckin panties on your tree horny fucks. Socks lay curled up in Sid's lap purring content to have found a new owner that loved swords as much as he loved cats. Sid lay with his hands behind his head leaning back on a less than comfortable log. This log MIGHT HAVE belonged to a TRENT because it was huge and looked like a peener.

"What do ya say Socks..." Sid said as he pet behind Sock's ear. Socks purred and purred and let out a small mew. "I think its time for bed too" Sid said in response. Taking one last puff of his pipe Sid breathed out a heavy sigh. Socks followed and readjusted his cute little body. Just as Sid felt sleep tug at his eyes he heard a loud SNAP.

Socks shot up with his ears behind scanning the surrounding woods. Sid slowly lowered his hand by his side to grab at his dagger.

"Shit" he thought to himself. "I really need to replace those" He kept his eyes shut and listened. He and socks were like two cats. Well...Socks was a cat so it was like maybe 1 and a half cats. Just listening. Look I'm not good at Cat Math.

Hearing nothing more Sid patted Socks on the head again. "Its ok buddy just a branch or a Dogman taking a hot doggy duece. Nothing to be afraid of"

"There sure isn't" said a crazy old man voice from right beside Sid's ear. Sid shot up. Socks jolted awake and let out a HISSSS. Sid got into karate position ready to kill an old man because that shit is fucked up to do to someone trying to sleep.

"I apologize young sir" Said the toothless old man. On his back was a large knapsack which rattled as he sat down on the peener log Sid had just been laying against.

"Didn'nt mean to scare ya". He pulled out his own pipe and began to smoke some Daranosian Dirt Dank. "Ahhhh Triple D's" he said letting out a large puff. "Mind if I join ya for a smoke?"

"Yes actual..."

"Great! I could use some warmth" said the old man cuttting Sid off.

"Alright" Sid said lowering his defenses slightly. "You shouldn't sneak up on people like that old timer. I could have killed you. Killed you with KARATE" He said firmly.

"Awww" the old man chuffed. "You wouldn't do that. You're a good guy I can tell." The old man squinted as if he was looking through Sid.

"Say" he finally broke eye contact. "Wouldn't happen to need any BONES would ya?"

Sid laughed. "What? uh...no no I"m all boned up" he said patting himself.

"Names T. Egg Mcloud" said the old man. "People just call me Egg on acount of it sounds like Egg the food. I dont quite get it but whatever" he said laughing a little too long.

"Right..." Sid said. Socks' ears were still pinned back.

"I'm a bone man ya see" The old man continued. "These woods here...FULL of bones. Nobody knows why but yep. 'The Grave Woods' they call em again...not quite sure why they call it that but who knows why people make up names for stuff." again laughing like a crazy old man for just a second too long.

"Anyhoo. Thanks for the company young man. If'n ya ever need any BONES just let me know! I wander 'round here all night. The night is when ya do your best bone huntin ya see? Gotta sneak up on them bones...they never see it coming at night" He laughed and laugned as he walked away from the camp. "OH" he said turning around. "One more thing. It's Gelatanous Ooze mating season so oyou best be on the look out for them...they like bones almost as much as I DO! Well so long kiddo" 

As he walked away he whistled a tune and started singing the lyrics:

"Bones all day bones all night

People say my mind ain't right

But I love bones and so do you

Gonna find me some bones to screw"

Sid looked down at Socks. "What the absolute fuck was that?" he said. Socks mewed and his ears perked back to normal. After a while the two fell asleep.

THUD. THUD. THUD.

Sid slowly opened his eyes. "What in the absolulte FUCK is that sound" he yelled out.

THUD. THUD. THUD. As his eyes adjusted to the light he could only see what he thought was the green light of the moons. Wait...the moons aren't green. He was fully awake now. He tried to move his hand but he was paralyzed. 

"Oh fuuuuuuuuuuuck" he thought. He peered around in his his peripherals and could see a halway. It was darnk and dank. Socks still lay on his lap but he too was frozen solid inside of this green prison. THUD THUD THUD. They were inside an Ooze and this ooze was going down a long set of dungeon stairs. Sid saw that they weren't the only meal this particular ooze had that night. Next to them was a boot, a fishing rod, an old iBall 4, and a pair of ladies underwear that said "Stake Daddy" on the croctch. Stake like a vampire's stake. So they probably belonged to a Thrall or maybe a vampire that had a really fucked up sense of humor? Did she mean like the dick was the stake? I mean I'm assuming a female was wearing these maybe it wasn't? "NOT THE TIME" Sid snapped himself out of this loop.

Soon they arrived at large chamber FULL of oozes. The ooze carrying them began to make the sound of a dog/cat/horse trying to hork up some nasty blork. Sid and Socks slid out from the oozes stomach? I dont know body sack? They lay on the cold stone floor of this chamber still feeling the effects of the paralyzing agent that the oozes must use to subdue any 'meals' they ingest. Sid could now move his head slowly. He turned to see Oozes all over the walls, on the ceiling, and basically just covering the whole chamber. They weren't moving however. Maybe they were saving him and socks for later?

"Just pretend your dead" a friendly voice said from next to Sid's left ear.

"Jesus fuck!" Sid yelled with his still mushy paralyzed lips.

"Oh sorry friend. Didn't mean to startle ya"

Sid forced his neck muscles to extend and turn his head to the left. Out of the corner of his eye he saw a skeleton. 

"Who...who's there" Sid said trying desperately to make his motor functions work.

"Oh hi there! Yep a little more to the left yep...It's me!" Sid heard as he also saw the skeleton's jaw and head turn and face him.

Sid  almost screamed as he saw the now alive skeleman talking to him.

"Shhhh" said the skeleton. "Make them think you're still paralyzed. They're pretty dumb so they might forget that they even brought you down here. By the way names Gary" said the skeleton as he held out his boney arm for a hand shake. "Oh my bad let me just..." Gary grabbed Sid's paralyzed arm and did a half hearted one arm hand shake. "There we go"

Socks mewed a muffled tired meow as he too was now waking from the effects of the paralytic.

"Don't worry friends" Gary said reassuringly. "This is my like..." he began counting on his boney fingers. "This is my like 6th time being eaten by these guys. They're not too bad once you get to know them. LOVE bones do these guys so I'm sure they won't even try to eat you until you've starved to death AND your flesh completely rots off your succulent meat rods."

"Jesus fuckin Christ" Sid said. Socks hissed a sleepy hiss.

THUD. THUD. THUD.

Suddenly a large ooze clopped into the room with an entire piano inside of him. The keys let out a muffled dissonent tone from within the blob's thick Jello-esque body. The blob began the same horking sound and spat the piano out. It rang louder as it slid across the room effortlessly on the frictionless slime that it was covered in. 

"BLORK BLORK BLORK" the Piano Ooze blorked.

"These fuckin things talk?" Sid asked looking leftish at Gary.

"Oh my yes" Gary answered. "I believe he said 'let the FEAT BEGIN' or maybe it was 'Lets get ready to RUMBLE' they're very similar in translation."

"Wait you speak Ooze?" Sid again asked.

"Oh yes of course! I studied it for 2 semesters at Bonerversity." Gary said proudly.

"BLORK BLORK KBLORK" The Ooze again shouted. This time sconses on the wall lit up with green, red, blue, saphire flame. An oozling formed from around the piano and began to play a pretty good version of Back Dat Azz Up by Juvenile. Oozes fuckin went buck wild. They slapped around and began digesting anything they could find. A techno beat somehow now was playing? I don't k now maybe one of them ate a cassio or something too who knows.

A long metal pole emerged from the floor and extended up to the ceiling like a stalagmite. The pole was covered in ooze and soon that ooze too congeled into a sexy stripper ooze. The oozes went wild as the stripper ooze who was legally obligated to have swallowed AT LEAST a thong while dancing clapped its glork and slork cheeks all over the place. Oozes threw finger bones to show appreciation.

"Ah yup" Gary said over the techno beat. "Classic Ooze mating season"

"We need to get the absolute fuck out of this place" Sid said to Socks.

"BLORK BLORK BLORK" Shouted an Ooze as it slithered up to Sid.

"He asked  if you're single" Gary whispered  

"Lets go" Sid said but as he tried to move  his legs they wouldn't respond. Seeing this meat sack rustling around only aroused the oozes further. The Cum Filled Ooze from like I dont know episode 3 did the ooze version of the robot across the dance floor. Oozes were inside of each other and outisde of each other just writhing with oozely lust.

"BLORK BLORK BLOK" shouted the ooze again at SId

"BLORK BLORK BLOORK LORKK" Gary said in reply.

"BLORK BLORK BLORK BLORK" the ooze said grabbing them both with what best could be described as an ooze claw. Probably the best hand this thing could manage.

"Where the actual fuck is this thing taking us?" Sid demanded to know.

"We're going to the King's chamber" Gary said. "A great honor for any ooze"

"Yeah but we aren't oozes man" Sid said annoyed.

"True but I'm choosing to take this as a compliment" Gary said with a smile. Or what could  maybe have been a smile once long ago when he had skin and a face.

The ooze brought them to a huge wooden door and blorked against it. It slid open and the ooze tossed the captives into the well lit room. Sid could see a kingly chair and smelled the scent of turkey and meade. The flaming sconces on the walls were lit with regular orange fire. There was a bed in  the corner. And most weirdly of all, nothing was covered in vomit inducing green ooze that smelled like if athelete's foot had  itself had an even worse case of athlete's foot.

Sid sat up. Good. He could use his torso now. Socks stretched out a leg and then another. Cats are so cute when they do that. Slowly the large chair began to turn and in its place sat....


"Oh hey Sid" 

"FLYMAN" Sid yelled smiling. "You're the king?" 

Flyman sighed. "Yeah...I guess I dont know. I dont know what I am anymore you know?"


"Yeah yeah" Sid said dismissively. "You're depressed still we get it. But at least that means  everything is pretty normal. Help us get the frick out of here"

(Sighing)"I probably can't help you. I'm pretty useless. I'm really only a king in title I dont really have any actual kingly powers so I'm sorry guys but you can have some turkey if you want" Flyman leaned over a turkey leg. As he did acid from his mouth tube dripped down and melted the turkey leg and melted the floor below it.

"Nevermind....I can't even give you turkey without flymanin' it up" he said sobbing.

Sid sat up and stood on  his feet. He wobbled. Gary perked himself right up as unnatrually as you would imagine a living skeleton with  no musculature would do.

"We're getting out of here lets go" Sid said. 

The 3 of them and Socks crept out of the king's chamber and stealthed their way down a dark hall. The thumping of beats and ooze booty could be heard and felt through the floor. Below was a grade A fuck fest. Turning a corner Sid saw a chest.

"Good maybe there's torch in here or somethihng" he  said quickly opening the chest.

"Wait Sid that..." Gary said but it was too late.

The chest reared up and green ooze replaced what was once brown wood and steel.

"thats a mimic" Gary finished his sentence.

Socks leapt into action and bit Sid drawing blood and turning into his katana form. Sid sliced the mimic clean intwain.

"Thats not gonna...."Gary again began to say.

The ooze slid apart like 2 pieces of ham that you left in the crisper for just a tad too long, then they reformed and were now 2 sentient oozes.

"Guess I should have seen that coming" Sid said looking at the now two oozes coming toward him. "Guess we'll do this the COOL WAY" he said igniting Socks into a flaming sword of black hellish death. He launched a fire bolt at one and then the other ooze. Each bolt struck true and the oozes began to smolder and bubble. As they writhed on the stone floor boiling from the inside out, a green noxious gas cloud began to form and float toward the party.

Fly man coughed and gagged. Gary coughed and wait why would he cough? Maybe he was just being nice and pretending?

"I'm just being nice and pretending" Gary said to Flyman as he held him up.

The smell was toxic. It burned their noses and lungs. It smelled like chlorine and  that smell when brakes burn. It smelled like burning  cat hair along with that smell that  Creepy Crawlers gave off  when you put them into that little light bulb oven. Sid's eyes began to water as  he saw a glint of light within the 2 now scalding, boiling, pulsating gas sacks. Covering  his mouth he ran into the haze and kicked the oozes with his thick boot. There on the ground lay 2 pristine ancient sleek daggers. 

"Well that works too" he thought as he quickly ran back down the hall.

Running down the hall Sid looked over at Flyman.

"How in the ever loving fucking shit did you become the king of the gelatinous oozes Fly?" he asked.

"They saw me out on my daily cry walk and the next thing I know they're all bowing before me. They carried me into this dungeon and have been giving me bones and  stuff for like 2 weeks."

"Why didn't you just leave?" Sid asked.

"Well I didn't want to be rude..." Flyman said.

Gary click clacked up beside them. "It's like that old gelatinous ooze saying 'It's not the putrid wretched filthy shit that's on the outisde that counts...it's the sick rotten festering puss filled rancid decaying fetid gangrenous absolute dog shit that's on the inside that counts."

Soon they arrived at the chamber where the ooze ritual was in. 

"We're gonna have to pretend we're ooze" Gary said doing voice warm ups. "Ooo AHHHH LALALALA" he began to sing

"Yeah fuck that" Sid said as he raised  Socks. As he did a magenta flame began to burn as hot as yo mama's ass cheeks when I clapped them boys silly with my ding donger while you were at little league last week. 

"ACTION KARATE BOLT" Sid said in an ancient tongue, not knowing how he even knew the words.

The whole room filled with flame. The group ran for their lives and were soon outisde the dungeon.

"Guess you can say...that party was.....LIT" Gary said nudging Flyman in the ribs.

"I want to fucking die" Flyman said.
