Ep 37

Axes and Blacksmiths

Pretty in Stink

Now, this is a story all about how

My life got fucked right into the ground

And I'd like to take a minute

Just stay tuned

I'll tell you how I became the princess named Axewound

In West KIlliladelphia born and raised

On the playground was where I stabbed mostly old ladies

Stabbin', slashin', killin', all cool

And shootin' up 8 b-balls outside of a school

When a couple, my parents, who were up to no good

Decided to abandon me in some neighborhood

Rose the dead and caused one little blight everyones scared

she thought, "how would I have turned out if only my parents cared..."

"And that concludes the singing of our National Anthem" Axewound spoke into an olde timey all see ball. "Don't forget to fill out your permission slips for our yearly field trip to the surface world to wreak havoc on the weak! Have an AWFUL day my minions mommy hates you!" 

With a click the morning announcments were over. Down in the depths of some gods foresaken pit were goblins, bog men, dog men, clog men (a mix of dog and bog men who only wore clogs) and every other kind of sick undesireable miscreant Daranos had banished to the shadows long ago and forgotten about. All were seated in a cafeteria style mess hall being served their morning goop straight from a giant cauldron with like arms and heads in it. It wasn't too bad if you hit it with some Sriracha.

"Uhhhh" Mutt the Goblin looked around at the horde of gross beast men as he fiddled with a toe nail in his goop.

"You new here?" Another older goblin asked Mutt.

"Yeah...yeah" Mutt said trying to sound tougher and older.

"The names Glut" the older goblin said matter of factly.

"I'm Mutt" said Mutt. "I wasn't aware how much like high school Heck could be" He finished with a slight chuckle.

"OH YEAH Mistress Axewound sure went all out. She HATES those pricks up above with their Wizard Ivy League and those fuckin plant fondling dendropheliacs at that Druid Academy. I swear if I had to go to another one of their proms and listen to Dashboard Cornfessional I'd blow my brains out with a suicide wand." Glut rambled.

"WAIT WAIT WAIT" Interrupted a dog man from one table over. "You're name is Glut right? And yours" He jabbed a paw into Mut's chest "...is MUT?!". "Man all you Gobbos named for sounds a butt makes or what!?" the dogman laughed as his friends all joined in.

"Yeah tahts what names are Gerald" Glut stood up. "They're just sounds your mouth makes to identify something or someone. Like you could be named Lord Queefington Von Shit Kisser, for instance, and we'd still associate that sound with your ugly ball licking dog face"

"oooooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" the whole cafeteria got quiet as someone did the sitcom Ooooo.

"OI MY DEAD DADS NAME WAS LORD QUEEFINGTON VON SHIT KISSER WHAT OF IT YOU TOSSER!" A bog man yelled from across the room.

"Sorry Clarence" Glut apologized to the Bog Man. Clarence sat down seeming to accept the apology. Gerald the dog man on the other hand had stood up with his pack of dog hooligans. Each wore a leather jacket adorned with bone spikes and human ears. One defiantly wore a chocolate bar bling necklace around his huge muscly neck. These guys were not to be fucked with.

"I'll give you a ball to lick..." Gerald said getting all up in Glut's face.

"Just the one or..." Glut shot back with a smile.

"Why you Rotting Barrel of Scrotum Meat!" Gerald drew his paw fist.

"OI MY DEAD MOTHER'S NAME WAS ROTTING BARREL OF SCROTUM MEAT" Clarence agan shot up in a rage. This time all shit popped off as the tensions boiled over into an all out high school riot.

A dogman threw a severed human head landing on the table right in front of Mutt who was shocked. Glut threw a sucker punch at Gerald as he was focused on the food flying around him. He nailed Gerald right in his snooter as Gerald let out one of those sad dog yelps that I hate that they put into video games like when you have to kill wolves and shit. The dogman crew flipped over their table and began to maul anyone and anything. Mutt dove under the table completely unprepared for what was poppin off.

A dogman ripped off a bog mans arm and green blork shot out of the wound yojimbo style. The bogman screamed for 10 straight seconds as the dogman whipped the arm around like dogs do when they play with the Daily Growl.

A Clog Man was tap dancing on the pupled remains of a Goblins face as someone put on every song from the 2000s hardcore band Atreyu on the jukeball.

"So much for a smooth first day of villain school" Mutt said to himself as another human head landed right in front of him with a thud.

"ATTENTION HSSSSS" An announcement over the all see ball caused the riot to pause mid melee. "This is Vice Principal Sett. Would Mutt the Goblin please report to Principal Axewound's pleasure pit...I mean office. Mutt the Goblin please report to Principal Axewound. Continue with the riot".with a click the announcement was over.

"Oooooooooooooooooooooo" Said the same voice from the back of the cafeteria.

As Mutt walked into Axewound's Pleasure Pit and Sex Office Vice Principal Sett was already standing in the corner of the room with is snake arms crossed.

"Take a sssseeeat Mr. Mutt" he said pointing an iron chair with straps and restraints.

Mutt sat down gingerly as he was sure everyone else who sat in that chair did after they had been seated in it.

Across the desk, which was cluttered with whips and chains and handcuffs, Axewound sat in a giant swivel throne. Her back turned to Mutt.

Moments passed without anyone saying anything. The tension almost drove Mutt insane. Why was he here? It was his first day. What could he have possibly done?

"Mr Mutt...." Axewound almost whispered. Her words almost soothed Mutt but then he remembered whose lips were saying them. The lips that ended King Gnarles' reign of the Orc Kingdom when it was said she drained his life force from all 6 of his peeners at once.

"You're probably wondering why you're here? It's your first day after all and what could you possibly have done?" Axewound slowly turned around in her swivel throne. She wore her usual half dominatrix half stripper outfit but now, to add a bit of professionalism, she wore a tiny clip on tie around her neck.

"How...I..." Mutt fumbled for words. He was simultaneously terrified and turned on. He was bonerfied.

Axewound stitched her fingers together gently as she leaned forward. "I noticed you not participating in the riot?" She smiled. "You hid under the table like a little weiner baby as heads and gore flew all around. Tsk tsk tsk" she tapped her thumbs together emphasising each tsk.

"How did you ...I mean...I'm sorry mistress..." Mutt rambled.

"I see ALL." Axewound threw her arms up like she were throwing confetti. "Do you think we are in the business of hiding under tables and not murdering people at lunch time hmmm Mr. Mutt?" she was not instantly standing next to Mutt. Mutt was sure he didn't take his eyes off of her and somehow she moved faster than anything he had ever seen or not seen.

She ran her long finger under his green chin arching it upward and jamming a single long almost metalic finger nail into the bottom of his chin.

"We are here to FUCK SHIT UP" She said slowly drawing a bit of green blood from Mutts chin.

"SO!" She relaxed her finger and gently flicked the blood off it. "As punishment for not participating in the time honored tradition of lunch time mess hall rioting I have a special assignement for you."

"Oh gods..." Mutt gulped.

"oH GoDs!" Axewound mocked as Sett chuckled still standing the corner of the room like some mute hype man. "Relax little Muttly. All I need you to do is go down to the lower depths to the smithy. He has a weapon ready for me. You go get it and come back and thats it! Easy peasy peener squeezy" 

Axewound was not back behind the desk. Mutt was shaking. The lower depths were not joke. Rumor had it a janitor who killed young goblins still roamed around down there mopping up their blood with a haunted busket made out of the bones of ever YOUNGER goblins.

"Go forth Young Muttling! And bring back my prize!" Axewound smiled a huge toothy grin as she slowly spun her throne around again. "Did she just like...sit looking at the wall all day. What the hell did she do all day in this place" Mutt thought to himself as he quickly made his exit.

"Sett you're up!" Axewound said as she peered at a small all see ball against the wall. "We're playing Mario Kart 64 and I call Yoshi and I dont want to hear any complaining about how you're a snake and he's like a lizard or a dinosaur or whatever and why can't I be Princess Peach ya racist ass fuck"

"Ohhhh allllriiiiiight' Sighed Sett as he grabbed the controler.

Mutt reached the rickety old metal lift in record time. He needed to get this over with and fast. Nobody fails the Queen and survives. As the rusted gate opened he practically jumped into the lift scanning the buttons for each floor.

"Sex dungeon....no....Torture dungeon....no....Sexual Torture Dungeon....no....Ah there...Lower Depths." Mutt read the ancient markings on the lifts magical buttons. All were skrawled in stone except for Lower Depths which was just a lable maker sticker someone had placed there ominously. Mutt pressed the correct button and the ancient lift squealed and lurched to life like your whore mama did last night when I pushed her correct button.

After a few seconds the lift began to slow. Mutt checked the floor and it read "Cleaning Supplies and Sexual Torture Dungeon." As the the metalic gate slowly creaked open Mutt saw a Skeleman with half of his human face still sagging loosely from his skull and in his hand...a mop. The Skeleman placed the mop down into a busket made of goblin bones and pushed the slop cart into the lift all without saying a word.

Mutt froze. He tried not to fidget or look at the janitor. He glanced over only to see the janitor staring directly at him. His head shot back forward reflexively. 

"Sooo..." Mutt said trying to make small talk. "...lots to clean up down here aye?"

The Janitor stood completely still. His one eyed gaze piericed the side of Mutt's head. Mutt could feel his eye inside of his brain as if it could see all the way through him. The lift began to stutter and clang to a slow stop.

"hmmmmmm how old are you, my young goblin friend?" The Janitor finally spoke.

"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" Mutt screamed and as the gate opened he was already out of the lift sprinting down into the lower depths.

As Mutt decended it began to get hot. Real damn hot. Like your whore mama last night after I began to decend into her depths. I plumbed her deep and good. 

As he rounded and doubled back around in a maze of molten onyx he could see an eerie blue flame off in the distance. All around the red from the lava flows reflected off the shining glass stone which had been heated and reheated for eons. Mutt ran his fingers against the smooth stone as he walked and it let out a slight SCREEEEEECH from his fingers. 

"WHO GOES THERE" A raspy gutteral voice shouted from within the blue.

"Uhhhh It's me sir....Mutt the Goblin..." Mutt said unsure of whether that was correct protocol.

"Mutt the Goblin huh? He he he" The voice trailed off as the clang of metal against metal rang through the cavern. After another turn Mutt found himself in a grotto of flame and steam. All around were weapons, armor, shackles, chains, gold and silver. Everything you could forge seemed to be down here in this one carved out rocky island of a workshop.

Mutt could see a tattered stitched together skeleman clanging away on an anvil, his back turned to Mutt.

"Mutt the Goblin...." The Blacksmith said again to no one in particular. 

"Uhh yes sir I am here for a weapon..." Mutt tried to shout over the sounds of the workshop.

"Yes...Mutt the Goblin" The blacksmith said as he turned around to face Mutt. There stood a comlpetely desicated skeleman. He wore the armor and apron of a smith from centries ago. His eyes glowed green from within his hollow skull. His bare teeth permanently forced into kind of a smile as approached Mutt. Again Mutt froze in terror.

"Do you know what you are delivering Mutt the Goblin?" The Blacksmith said ominously still approaching at a snails pace. His boned legs lifting his armor slowly. Clanging with each footfall.

"Just...just a weapon for the mistress..." Mutt said almost pissing himself.

"Oh I think you are to deliver something much more than that, Mutt the Goblin" The Black smith said holding out a hand reaching for Mutt. Mutt closed his eyes. But as the Blacksmiths boney hand touched Mutt's shoulder all Mutt felt was a gentle pat.

"Come, Mutt the Goblin, let us enjoy some tea" The blacksmith said as he gently coaxed Mutt over to a table. 

Like a doddering old man the Blacksmith carefully poured some tea into a tin cup Mutt had presumed the blacksmith had himself fashioned. The kettle clanged against his bones as his weakened body shuttered and shook at even the weight of the tea kettle.

Mutt looked over toward the blue flame and anvil. "How could this skeleman lift and forge such heavy metals when he can't even lift this kettle?" Mutt thought to himself.

"Because I am imbued with dark necromancy. The same dark necromancy that the mistress herself uses. In fact it could be said I am imbued with her very essence...." The blacksmith said taking a sip of tea. Mutt watched as the tea just dribbled down his rib cage.

"How did you hear me thinik that?" Mutt asked shocked.

"I just told you....DARK. NECROMANCY. Keep up young Mutt the Goblin. Now...as to why you are here I have some good news and some bad news. Which would you like first."

"The good news I guess?" Mutt said almost whincing at the question.

"The good news is the mistress's weapon is almost complete." 

"And the bad news.....is ........what?" Mutt was not physically whincing in his seat.

"The bad news pertains to that which you are delivering to me Mutt the Goblin. See...for I was once one of the only few smitthies in Daranos that could forge Cold Steel. It took the Mistress centuries to find my remains and decades more to find the right necromantic spells to ressurect me. She finally realized...that much like forging metal, a necromancer must put a bit of themselves into their creations. Thus, she put her knowledge into me and I was able to make wonderful things. And terrible things....."

Mutt looked over at the blue flame. He saw imbedded into the anvil a blue double sided battle axe. It glowed defiantly blue in the red heat of the cavern.

"The axe...it comes with a price...." The Blacksmith was now looking at the axe too. "Your soul Mutt the Goblin"

Mutt was now totally in piss pants mode moving into poop pants territory. Code Brown Town.

"You are not the first minion that the Mistress has sent down here on an 'errand'. In order for me to continue my work and retain my knowledge, she sends down some poor unwitting soul for me to....well...rekindle my flame." The Blacksmith turned his head back toward Mutt. His eyes glowed with green fire. They were almost hungry.

"And as you can see...I have been down here a very....very.....very long time..." The Blacksmith gestured a boney hand to an onyx slab the size of a cottage. On it were scrawled the names of countless minions. "Gertrude Stewgobbler....Schlong Bong the Dwarf....Bingus Bongus the Dingus.....Wayne the Guy From Accounting....." The list went on and on.

"....Mutt the Goblin...." The Blacksmith sighed out. "You are the last....after this I can rest. The weapon is complete....."

The Blacksmith's eyes glowed emerald green. His hand slowly reaching out toward Mutt now imbued with evil magiks. Green sparks shot from his finger tips. And then......nothing.

With an outstretched arm the Blacksmith just stopped. He stopped inches away from Mutt's face and slowly drew back his death reach.

"Mutt the Goblin....take the axe.....take the axe and run...." his eyes flickered a blue flame and back to green and back to blue. From somewhere  inside of him the good man that was the blacksmith for kings and heroes eons ago saw something. He saw hope. 

"ENOUGH OF THIS TEA TOTTLING BULLSHIT!" Axewound's voice boomed through the chamber. The ground shook as weapons and armor banged and clanged onto the ground. Cracks of molten magma streaked across the ground as if it were a payne of glass. Then Mutt saw it.

There was the Queen atop a Necrodragon.

"You fail me on the last hurdle Dorin? After all that I have given you? After all the years of a life returned?" Axewound said still wearing that sexy little tie.

"I....I....Won't......let....."

"Youl....you you you won't let let let" Axewound mocked a stutter and then with a snap of her fingers the light, whether green or blue, was extinguished from the blacksmith's eyes forever.

Axewound reached out for the axe like Thor. It rattled as she strained to free it from its anvil display. Finally it lunged at her flying through the air toward her grasp. But in the last instant, coming out of the backfield like Deion Sanders, Mutt the Goblin intercepted the axe. He rolled to the ground holding it almost like a child and before he could even get to his feet was already making a dash for the lift.

"UGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAA" Axewound sighed dramatically. "Fine we'll do it this way"

As Mutt rounded onyx pillars and stone the Necrodragon was smashing them into dust. Shrapnell of onyx sharp as glass cut through Mutt's skin. He ducked and dodged utilizing most of the 5 D's of dodgeball to limited success. By the time he reached the lift gate he was green and bloodied. He frantically pushed the button about a thousand times as he heard the Axewound laughing behind. The dragon was destroying everything in its path. 

BING BONG "Mind the gap" teh lift beeped as the gate opened. Mutt was already in frantically pressing the top floor button furiouisly. As the gate closed he saw the open maw of the Necrodragon and its green death fire brewing within. 

BING BONG the gate shut just in time for the dragons breath to hit it melting away the metal and barely saving Mutt's life as the lift rose to freedom.

Mutt sat down panting and crying. He fully pooped pants this time. But he was safe. 

Then suddenly....clang boom and the lift lurched upward unnatrually. CLANG RIIP CREEEEAK as the floor was gnawed away by the huge jaws of the Necrodragon. Mutt screamed like a 4 year old girl as the dragon began to dismantle the rickety metal lift. Out of either sheer courage or pure terror he raised the enormous battle axe and swung down at the dragons snoot. The axe landed true and splintered the dragons nostrils. It roared in rage and pain and with one last twisting yank of its neck ripped the lift from its chains.

"DOWN YOU GO....NEXT STOP HOSIERIES AND HABBADACHERIES...THE STORE WILL BE CLOSINg FOREVER....>WHEN YOU DIE" Screamed Axewound still laughing and having the time of her life.

But the dragon was hurt. It did not like the sting of cold steel. It lost its wings and began to fall with the lift. Mutt grasped the axe in one hand and grasped whatever was left of the lift with the other. Axewound was enjoying even this part of terrifying ride. Laughing all the way down into the molten depths until they hit loose molten rock.

The dragon hissed and roared. It's bones shattering and splintering against the rock saving it's master and rider the brunt of the fall. Mutt however was not so proteced. The lift warped and bent around him. Goblins were tough though. He held onto the axe as they both the lift and dragon dropped again through the loose molten ground. 

Again Axewound was on top of Mutt. She had someone moved quicker than sight itself.

"COME HERE YOU LITTLE GREEN TURD" She screamed as she grabbed Mutt's leg. But as they fell through another chamber of molten rock some dripped on her right hand fusing it to Mutt's leg. Mutt screamed in pain. Axewound laughed in agony.

And again they fell down down down.

"Yeah so that's what happened with the Red Ants" The Red Ant Queen finished a long and probalby important story that nobody but Dant heard. "I'm queeenless...I have no hive or family."

Both Dant and the Red Ant Queen were walking along a sheer cliff outcropping. Below a molten lake of fire reflected off of their compound eyes. They had been walking for who knows how long. Probably like a few weeks or how ever long it takes for everyone on this fucking show to get over being sick.

Suddenly they heard a shuffling of rock from above. And then an avelanche. They watched in slow motion as a bone dragon and a goblin fused together with some kind of sex worker fell from the cavern above. It was like that shot in LOTR when Gandalf falls with the balrog but if you paused this scene at teh right time you'd totally see a titty.

Mutt used his remaining energy to swing the axe one last time. It clanged against the side of the cliff face and found purchase on some rocks. Dant and the Red Queen scurried over. Below Dant saw Axewound grasping desperately with her free hand at Mutt. She screeched with anger. Her eyes like hate lasers.

"Grab my hand!" Dant said offering an arm.

"NO.....NO JUST...." Mutt was losing his grip on the axe handle. If only the Blacksmith had finished the grip. But then again that would mean Mutt would be dead.

"TAKE THE AXE!" Mutt screamed. And then he let go. Mutt and Axewound fell down yet again into a lake of pain and fire. The Axe held firm in the rocks as Dant held out an empty hand.

"What the fuck was that all about?" asked the Red Queen

FIN
