	Prompt: Possessions & Frogs
</p>

<p>
	by Josh Henderson
</p>

<p>
	I don't know hwat to name this bc the prompts included fucking FROGS
</p>

<p>
		"Filg....Filg Karf" a young Cat Girl called while reading a scroll. 
</p>

<p>
	"Here!" Filg said enthusiastically.
</p>

<p>
	"You've been assigned to the Frog House, Filg. Gather your bindle and whatever the hell else you have and report to them. Take a right at the Vomitorium and then a right at the Pissing Pool then another right at the Prom Survivors Memorial and the house is on your right. You got that right?"
</p>

<p>
	"Right!" Filg said somewhat confidently. Filg had earned his place at the Druid Academy studying under his mentor Bub McMabub, a noble Orc like himself who mastered turning into a fish that swims up peoples pee holes. That's not a fantasy thing that's a real ass fish. Look it up. Also look up "Devils Breath". Shit is wild out there boys. Stay frosty stay frosty.
</p>

<p>
	Soon Filg arrived at the house and knocked on the door. A small Blobit answered.
</p>

<p>
	"Ah our new member welcome welcome" He said as he ushered Filg into the common area.
</p>

<p>
	"The names Quig or Big Quig. Betcha want to know why they call me that?"
</p>

<p>
	"Not reall..."
</p>

<p>
	"Well I'll tell ya! Its on the account of my totally healthy ego. Some say the most healthy and not at all annoying or overbearing WHATSOEVER. Yep just Quig livin his best life. Living well is the best revenge. Thinking positive thoughts will bring positive results. Yep thats what I always say over and over and over and over and over..."
</p>

<p>
	Filg stopped paying attention. As he looked around he saw just what kind of house this was. Empty mead barrels. Empty Pizzaroni boxes. House members passed out. A pair of panties on a sconce that said "Steak Daddy's Girl" on the crotch part you know, where the vagina would be. As if on queue the other house members started to awaken from their drunken night of debauch and crotch.
</p>

<p>
	"...and over and over and over and over again. Say...what's your name new guy?"
</p>

<p>
	"Uh Filg" Filg responded.
</p>

<p>
	"Well Uh Filg you're going to love it here. See you've noticed the painting!"
</p>

<p>
	Filg looked up to see a massive portrait over the hearth with the likeness of a young boy riding a rat and spanking its rat ass with a riding crop. In his hand a treebranch. On his head a prom king crown and in his other hand the riding crop just smackin that rats ass hard and firm. Like just really really going at it. You could see it moving even though it was a painting! Damn that dude can spank.
</p>

<p>
	"That's our founder...The Great Jimmy Treebranch" Quig said while lowering his head and taking off an imaginary hat.
</p>

<p>
	"If only he were still with us..." (audience gasps)  "............and not upstairs sleeping AFTER A NIGHT OF PARTYING LIKE  A FUCKIN GOD KING!!!"
</p>

<p>
	At this the whole house started to go wild. A troll bro did a keg stand on a keg filled with lighterfluid. A Orc brother did the worm across the room and up a fuckin wall and onto the ceiling back down the wall. 
</p>

<p>
	"No but serously" Quig said somber once again. "He has been asleep quite a while...we fear he'll never wake up..." (audience gasps)
</p>

<p>
	"...never wake up without a FUCKIN HUGE HANG OVER FROM ALL THE MEAD AND PUSS PUSS HE GOT LAST NIGHT BABY BAAAAAAAAAAABY"
</p>

<p>
	The crew again lost its collective fuckin shit. Orc Brother #2 ripped his pantaloons off and began helicoptering his 6 dicks around so fast he could do that kung fu wooden hand thing from jackie chan movies. A Cat Bro lit his own tail on fire and used it to light up a spliff so huge you could hot box Grollcho Marx out of his Model A Bone Car. A human druid slowly did the robot across the screen I mean floor. Quig put on his imaginary hat. Or maybe it was some kind of inviso hat?
</p>

<p>
	"Well get settled Uh Filg. Prom is in 8 hours and then we party!"
</p>

<p>
	"It's just Filg" 
</p>

<p>
	"Well better get ready and head up to your bunk Just Filg" Quig replied as it bit into a raw onion and whistled as he walked away twirling his pocket watch.
</p>

<p>
	MEANWHILE at the Rats and Skulls secret society house located on the other side of campus as to metaphorically separate the two houses not just by ideology but physical location, Xap Kurz slowly removed his wayrestferer sunglasses from his imp dicked face.
</p>

<p>
	"Every year we get these new scrubs in for recruits and every year they get worse and worse" Xap angrily said as he rubbed his templed.
</p>

<p>
	"I mean look at this guy!" he continued as he pointed to a Rat Man. "This guy is a literal RAT! What kind of lazy ass writing is this!? Like the author of our reality isn't even trying anymore. Someone should fuckin fire that guy. ALSO I'm pretty sure putting  a literal Rat Man into the Rats and Skulls frat is racist as fuck. Now I have to tip toe around this for the rest of my senior year god what a nightmare."
</p>

<p>
	"Uhhhh boss that Fink Drinkleton" Trolgar said
</p>

<p>
	"More like Stink Stinkleton" Xap replied. "LAUGH LACKY" Xap snapped as he hit Trolgar
</p>

<p>
	"Owwwww" 
</p>

<p>
	"Sorry sorry I didn't mean to hit you in the forehead but I mean my god man you're like all forehead. Parents should have named you Fivehead. Youre...You're so much forehead that I bet you put lipstick on your head just to make up  your mind..."
</p>

<p>
	(crickets)
</p>

<p>
	"I SAID LAUGH DUMMY"
</p>

<p>
	"Ha. Good one boss" Trolgar replied half foreheadedly.
</p>

<p>
	"I have a plan to put those lousy loser Frogs in their place at this years 69th annual prom. That's the 69th prom we've had this year. So not like 69th once a year prom but annaual like we count them in terms of how many we've had in a given year."
</p>

<p>
	Xap began to laugh maniacally until it got super uncomfortable and nobody knew when it was ok to just go on with their day and like do other stuff.
</p>

<p>
	CUT TO PROM.
</p>

<p>
	"ALLLRIGHT EVERYONE this one is for the couples...grab your best girl or boy or other and get your booty butts on the dance floor. Don't forget to book me for all your DJing and Tanning needs at DJTANNER.COM on your all see balls....now lets get with the smooching"
</p>

<p>
	Then Closer by NIN played.
</p>

<p>
	Quig and Filg idly made there way to the punch trough both sweating from doing crazy pop n lock dances that they rehearsed earlier like She's All That style.
</p>

<p>
	"So you guys do this like every day?" Filg asked
</p>

<p>
	"Oh yeah yeah Druid Academy is mainly about proms. And trees. And animals....but mainly proms." Quig relpied as he chugged down a frothy mead. Just as he finished he heard a slow clap.
</p>

<p>
	"Well well well if it isn't Small Quig and new guy" Xap said as he ended on an overlly dramatic long slow clap.
</p>

<p>
	"well well well if it isn't Xap the Imp dicked loser and his loser gang along with what is this guyy? Like some kind of rat man?"Quig replied as he narrowed his eyes at the rat man.
</p>

<p>
	"THAT FINK DRINKLETON" Xap snapped back. "Of the Grall DRINKLETONS?! You've never heard of them they're a fairly high class family very rich very cool.
</p>

<p>
	"More like Stink Stinkleton" Filg jabbed just as the music cut out and everyone started laughing having heard his hilarioius joke.
</p>

<p>
	"YO DEGMAN YOU HEAR THE NEW GUY?" A fellow Frog said. 
</p>

<p>
	"YEAH DUDE NEW GUYS FUCKIN HILARIOUS. STINK STINKLESON....CLASSIC" another Frog said from across the room.
</p>

<p>
	"New guy's got jokes huh?" Xap said clearly annoyed. "Well lets see how much your ass likes being turned into a frog!" Xap flourished his hands and....nothing happened.
</p>

<p>
	"uhhhh" Filg laughed. "Yeah I'm a Frog. They put me in Frog house." Again the entire Prom began to laugh. 
</p>

<p>
	"FROG HOUSE" Delgan said from across the room. "CLASSIC"
</p>

<p>
	This time however Xap wasn't phased. He nonchallantly put a candy cigarette in his mouth, bit down slowly, and chewed the chalky candy as cooly as he could. He then reached into his members only cloak and got his wayrestfarers and slowly pu tthem on.
</p>

<p>
	"Have a nice night, Frog" He said sharply then snapped his fingers to get the attention of his minions. "RATS N SKULLS MOUNT UP" he shouted.
</p>

<p>
	"Uhhhh boss we had to leave our mounts outside remember? They dont let mounts into Proms anymore on account of them only requesting 'In The Jungle The Mighty Jungle'" Trolgar said stupidly like an absolute fucking moron.
</p>

<p>
	Xap let out an exacerbated sigh and grabbed for another candy cig. "I hope you die soon" he said under his breath.
</p>

<p>
	The night went on and Filg enjoyed his first ever prom. 
</p>

<p>
	"Uhhhh Filgy" the Cat Girl from earlier teased as she swooshed her tail around his face. "Take me to your bunk or lose the chance to get crunk" she said all sexy.
</p>

<p>
	CUT TO THE NEXT MORNING. You didn't think I was going to describe the cat sex did you? C'mon guys this is a family show. I know you jerk off to this and I'm really flattered by that but sometimes I just want to tell a wholesome story about a Cat fucking an Orc in the privacy of his very public and very unsanitary frat house. 
</p>

<p>
	"Filgy" Cat Girl purred. I know I know I should give her a name. In many ways it implies that Filg didn't get her name which is pretty scummy. And by association it makes me scummy so lets call her 'Catarina" yeah thats a good cat name. 
</p>

<p>
	"Filgy" CATARINA purred again. "Will you get me some water?" She said all hot but then began to hork up a hairball. Or maybe it was just regular puke from being hung over from all the drinking and adult sex with a 6 dicked orc she had last night. PROM BABY!
</p>

<p>
	"FIlgy?" As she looked down she saw Filg who was now A FROG!?!?!?!?! 
</p>

<p>
	"FILG I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!" Catarina said. "This isn't funny! Putting a frog in bed with me!?!? NOT COOL DUDE!" She picked up the frog and tossed it out of the nearest window. 
</p>

<p>
	As she did she could hear the frog croaking. Filg woke up mid flight. As he opened his eyes he first noticed the sickening pain behind his eyes from drinking all that Minotaur Mead. The  next thing he noticed he was flying, through the air, and the ground was coming at  him fast. He screamed a froggy scream then SPLAT. He hit the ground. As he looked down he saw that his body was no longer his but that of a common pond ass frog. Like green and shit. Slimy and green and shit.
</p>

<p>
	"What the actual Frog Fucking Fuck!" he yelled.
</p>

<p>
	"THERE'S ANOTHER ONE BOYS" a high pitched squeaky voice shouted. Filg looked to see who it was but the grass was too tall. Where was he? He could be anywhere.
</p>

<p>
	"GET HIM MY MINIONS" shouted the voice. Just then a plattoon of tiny rat men came running out of the grassy jungle holding tooth pics as spears and kitchen knife broad swords and one ratguy had a revovler? Man where the hell....anyway.
</p>

<p>
	"You're under arrest for the crime of being  a FROG...the rats natural enemy. You have the right to remain stupid as fuck. Anything you say will be recorded and played back later at the after party to make fun of you. If you need an attorney one will be provided to you just kidding this is a kangarat court dummy ur fucked" 
</p>

<p>
	"Wait" Filg pleaded. "I'm...I'm a man...well an orc but I'm a sentient person!" 
</p>

<p>
	"We are also sentient people. What you think just because we are small we don't have thoughts and feelings and like to fuck our wives when our anxious son finally goes outside to play around a tree or play with a round hoop or a skip it? NO? You will be taken to the rat dungeons where you will be kept until your sham trial or until the battle is over"
</p>

<p>
	"Battle?!" Filg exclaimed
</p>

<p>
	"Gernal Ratsolov" a leuitenant tugged at his napoleon coat. "We must be moving the Frogs could be here any second. This piece of shit could be a scout"
</p>

<p>
	"RAT BOYS MOUNT UP" Ratsolov shouted.
</p>

<p>
	CLANG. A heavy cell door made out of curtain rods shut behind Frog Filg. He was alone. As he sat in silence he began to weep.
</p>

<p>
	"First time?" a voice said from across the cell. At hearing this Filg jumped which was pretty high because he was a frog now.
</p>

<p>
	"Who...what the fuck is going on?" Filg demanded to know.
</p>

<p>
	"Hey hey baby its cool. I'm a frog just like you. Names Peppermint Gonzalas....or Peppe for short. Or Peps G. No better stick to Peppe... Yup once was a great swordsman too. Been locked up in this here rat dungeon for a spell though. What I wouldn't give to hear a story about some nasty ass cat sex right about now...." Peppe trailed off.
</p>

<p>
	"What..." Filg was confused. 
</p>

<p>
	"I see. Well you must be  new aroudn these parts" Peppe went on. "See we frogs worship the Frog Dieties who live in the wooden mountain castle way over to the east. And the rats worship some Rat Gods over on the other side of the grass planes"
</p>

<p>
	"Grass planes" Filg asked. "Oh you mean the courtyard"
</p>

<p>
	"Yup so until we get rescued or hanged we're stuck inside of this shitty cat porn storyless shitty shit hole." Peppe continued.
</p>

<p>
	JUST THEN a loud BOOM shook the entire cell followed by a trumpet. (trumpet noises)
</p>

<p>
	Filg and Peppe rushed to look out the meager barred window to the oustide. 
</p>

<p>
	"Can you see what that was?" Filg asked
</p>

<p>
	"No. But I'd recognize those green bars of freedom anywhere" Peppe said almost with a tear in his eye. "Thats General Sherman Croaks!"
</p>

<p>
	"CHARGE BROTHERS!" General Croaks shouted. Rat men rushed out to meet the frog offensive. Tiny cocktail swords and paring knives clashed against each other. The blood curdling screams of those who's skin newly pierced from metal could be heard for 3 scaled miles. The smell of blood and vicera filled the battle field.
</p>

<p>
	One rat cut off a frogs leg. As he fell over he screamed in agony. 
</p>

<p>
	"AHHHHHH" "
</p>

<p>
	"RIBSLY" a fellow frog soldier said as he knelt down beside his fallen commrade.
</p>

<p>
	"Jump Jump...my dear friend. Take...(cough) take my wedding ring back to my frog wife....I'm ....I'm not gonna make me brother" With his last ounce of strengh Ribsly pried the keyring his wife had given him as a wedding band so many years ago. As he death croaked he lost control of his frog bowels and whatever frogs poop out filled the already horrid field of nightmares.
</p>

<p>
	"I will my friend...I will" Jump Jump said crying. "RIIIIIBBBBBBSLY!"
</p>

<p>
	The frog army presssed their advantage. A flaming bear's skull was brought out as a tiny horrifying battering ram to bust down the Rat fortifications.\
</p>

<p>
	Inside Rat Command and Control General Ratsolov was sweating. He knew Sherman Croaks strategies. He studied them at Rat Military College. The battle would continue until the frogs gained control all the food pellets the rats had stored up. And then...Ratsolov didn't want to think about it.
</p>

<p>
	"GERNAL RATSOLOV" came a booming frog voice from outside. "I have murdered your rat brethren and am sorry to say you are surrounded"
</p>

<p>
	From within the dungeon Peppe and Filg watched out the window in horror and hope and hanticipation? 
</p>

<p>
	"As you can see" Croaks went on " I have your food stores and even though you are rats and will literally eat shit off of your dead mother's flap jack ass tiddies, My guess is you can't survive with our your PRECIOUS pellets." As he finished Sherman Croaks pulled a toothpic arrow out of a dead rats eye socket along with his eye ball. He then took lit it on fire with a nearby flame and unleashed an arrow into the silo of food pellets. In a nano second the silo erupted in flames. 
</p>

<p>
	"FUUUUUUUUCK" Ratsolov said. As he did he reached for his leuitenants revolver held it to his head and pulled the trigger. The bullet went clear through is head and splattered against....wait the FUCKIN GUN WAS REAL?!? THERE WAS A RAT WITH A LITTLE FUCKIN TINY GUN THAT WORKED?!?!?! WHAT THE FUCK?
</p>

<p>
	"It's over" Peppe said as he laid back down and sighed a frog ribbit of relief. 
</p>

<p>
	Just then Filg felt something tingle inside of him. Was he on Devil's Breath? No...No the spell was wearing off. In an instant he was Filg sized again. He looked downto see like a shit ton of dead rats and frogs. This shit was gross man. Like frog D Day man. 
</p>

<p>
	Filg reached down into the little box that once was his prison and grabbed Peppe. The sun was now setting. Taps was playing quietly for the dead. 
</p>

<p>
	"C'mon old timer...I'll lshow you all the cat sex you can handle....you deserve it"
</p>
