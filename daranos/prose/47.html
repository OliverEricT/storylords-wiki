ep 47

Sign Posts & Underworlds

The Q.U.N.T.

"Not even a dog would lick this off the floor" Squib scolded Sandles as she wretched out the remnants of another hair ball. "How can someone who can turn into a legendary sword have this much hair inside of them? You disgust me..." he said sniffing the air.

"BLECH...actually....that doesn't smell too ba..." but before he could finish Buffcat was already zoomying his way into Squib's private cave quarters on all fours.

"Mew mew MAYOINK" he said as he slurped up the remaining hair ball.

"BUFFCAT EWWWWWW" Demi said as she followed him into Squib's cave room.

"Yeah Buffcat" Squib piled on. "I was gonna eat that!"

Jelly was now out of Demi's satchel and taking up position right next to Sandles as he too was now wretching up...something. After a few seconds Jelly hoarked up a key and ring with a skeletal hand still attached to it.

"Mew mew mew mew (You can have that)" Buffcat said with a chuckle.

"I'LL KILL YOU" screamed Squib as he lunged toward Buffcat.

"Guys guys guys SHHHHH" Demi scolded. "Ugla is trying to do magic stuff and I think find out how we can get out of here. Or at least I think she is..."

The gang peered out from behind a stained sheet Squib was using for a privacy curtain and saw Ugla sitting in the main cave area, which they called the den. She was hovering above the ground monk like with zitting magical sprites and sparks firing off of her every so often.

"Oh yeah I've been using her to make my pop corn" Squib said as he unpacked a jiffy pop and held it over Ugla's head. After a few second the pop corn kernels began to pop and cover her head in buttery goodness. 

"Is...that safe?" Demi asked.

"Sure! Why woudln't it be" Squib said as a single trickle of blood dripped from his pointy nose.

"FUCK THIS SUCKS!" Ugla finally said awaking from her meditative state. "I can't find a SINGLE essence of magic in this SHIT HOLE PIECE OF SWEATY USED ASS TAMPON OF A REALM" Squib slowly backed away but reached out for one more popcorn piece.

"Its ok Ug" Demi said patting her on the popcorn laden head. "We'll figure it out. Besides I'm from here and this place isn't so bad once you get used to it."

Just then outside of the cave a bone vulture swooped down to pick up a skeleman who had died a long time ago.

"WHYYYYYYYY" he screamed as the bird screeched and took him over the horizon. "WE'RE THE SAME YOU AND ME WHYYYYYYYYYYYyyyyyy" his voice faded out as an erie reminder that everything here did indeed suck harder than yo mama did last night. 

"Hell....ssrrrccchhh" a voice from Ugla all see ball tried to break through. "Hell....it's....m.........teh wize" 

Ugla quickly scootched over and grabbed the all see ball and held it above her head like she was trying to get a signal.

"Yeah that''ll do it. That's totally been the problem this whole time" Squib said rolling his eyes.

Finally the image of a familiar wizard shone through in all its blue magical splendor.

"Make it quick I have Neru masssage in 20" Reeses said totally seriously wihtout any shame.

"YOU CALLED ME!" Ugla screamed.

"Yes but you've been throwing off magical energy so vibrantly and spicy that I thought my entire body got magical chlamidia....again." Reeses said scratching his neck.

"YOU SENT US TO THE WRONG TIME ZONE....PLACE...THING" Ugla shouted.

"Did I?" Reeses said wryly and with a wink.

"......YES" all of them shouted in unicen.

"It's like a great wizard once said" Reeses cleared his throat. "'A wizard never makes mistakes. He pretends he never did and when evertying works out in the end takes credit for everything by pretending everything he did was on purpose kind of like hte end of Ocean's 13"

"Is that the one with the painting?" Demi asked.

"EW no that's 12 and WE DO NOT SPEAK OF THAT ONE IN THIS CAVE YOUNG LADY" Reeses said pointing down at Demi.

"We fucking saw you! You were wearing a stupid fake beard and pointed us in this direction. You're telling me that that was for a reason and that we're 'SUPPOSED' to be trudging through this wasteland for weeks on end until the end of the season!" Ugla yelled.

"First of all that handsome fellow who's personage is wholly his own property and who gets their own union day rate per appearance IS NOT ME even though we both share classically handsome wizard qualities...." Reeses said Voguing for the All See Camera. "AND SECOND OF ALL this person who is an entirely different entity as far as the goverment and wizard security are concerned, sounds like a really handsome and smart and big dicked having genius of a person who you should listen to." Reeses finished with a 2 Legit 2 Quit hand gesture.

Ugla moved to throw the all see ball out of the cave.

"WAIT wait wait" Reeses said interupting her. "There is a device that can send you back and forth and back again and forth again and back again"

"Why haven't I felt its magical essence then?" Ugla questioned with her hand on her hip all sassy like.

"Because the cave humping mongoloids who live in this time don't even know how to use deodorant let alone how to turn on a highly sophisticated magical device."

"Go on...." UGla said still skeptical.

"Just...keep heading west. You will be close enough to its presence to feel its essence once its turned on. Kind of like my ex wife!" Reeses said as crickets chirped somehow. "Am I right Guys and that one Cat who I think is a guy? EH!" The crickets got louder.

"But be careful" Reeses warned. "There is another who seeks the power to traverse tiiiiiiiiime" Reeeses began making squigly lines with his hands and fading out like yoda for dramatic effect.

Meanwhile in the west, Gunk and Axewound were still traversing their own hellish landscape and I don't mean their relationship AM I RIGHT GUYS? Guys?

"How're you feeling?" Asked Gunk.

"The same as the last 40 times you asked, Gunk" Axewound said. She adjusted a makeshift hood over her mouth to keep the dust out. She grabbed her hand and tried to make a rune but it only sparked and fizzled out. She gripped her hand and rubbed it.

"Sorry I just..." Gunk shrugged as he sensed Axewound rolling her eyes at him.

"ssssssssssssssssssssssSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT" screamed the top half of a skeleman as he fell from the sky and landed in the sands below them with a smack. Above them a bone vulture cawed and flew off.

"That doesn't even make any sense" Gunk said as he looked up at the featherless meatless bird flying away somehow.

Axewound looked down at the half mangled skeleman as she kicked his rib cage.

"HEY STOP THAT TICKLES" it said as she wiped her boot into the sand.

"What happened to you?" Gunk said picking up the skeleman and dusting off his bones. 

"I was simply taking a my morning crawl over east yonder when a bone vulture picked my ass up, called me the hard C slur, and dragged my out this way and then just dropped my ass in front of you two!" the skeleman chattered.

"Cunt?" Axewound questioned.

"EXCUUUUUSE ME!?!" the skeleman said clutching his pearls.

"Was that the hard C slur it called you? Cunt?" she clarified.

"Oh no....he called me a...." the skeleman leaned in closer and held his boney hand to his jaw as if to whisper. "....a Crackler" he said as he adjusted his head onto his spine and spun it around as if to screw it back into place.

"Now if you could just point me west I shall be off a crawlin back to my people!" the skeleman said with gusto.

"People?" Gunk mumbled.

"Oh yes we're a like minded group of Skelemen and Skelewomen who have found solice in worshiping out lord and savior, Qunt."

"You just got offended when yhou thought I called you that and now you say you worship a Cunt?" Axewound prodded.

"I thought you were taking our lords name in vain" the skeleton reasoned. "And that you were implying His name was a slur."

"Take us to this place" Axewound demanded.

"Uhhhh" Gunk cleared his throat. "What the lady means is we would love to learn more about this lord of yours and possibly drink some water and maybe eat something not made out of bones. My name is Gunk and that's Axe...."

"Axle Foley!" Axewound interrupted as she gave Gunk a stern look.

"Yes...famous Beverly Hills crime fighter and black comedy movie star from the 80s.....Axle Foley...." Gunk squinted at Axewound. She made the "GO WITH IT" face.

"NIce to meet you two, the names Norm...Norm Halfman" the Skeleman said holding out a boney hand for shaking. Gunk shook the hand gingerly and then placed it back down at Norm's side.

"Now! If we just head over to this sign post that I just saw just now for NO REASON we can get our bearings." Norm said slowly dragging himself through the sand.

"Eh....argh....eh....gruuunt...eh ehh.....argh" he said with each painfully slow pull of his torso through the gritty earth.

"Yeah I'm just gonna carry you if thats ok" Gunk said picking up the skeleton and C-3POing him onto his back.

Soon they reached a single misplaced signpost in the middle of literally no where. On it were many different directional indicators pointing to many locations like one of those "funny" sign posts you see at a tiki bar that says like "Hong Kong 12,467 miles" or "London 3 billion AU" or whatever measurment those fucks use. But on this sign were names like "Doomsburg" and "Analton" and "Shitty Analton".

"See once we get to Analton we're on the right path but don't go too far or you'll wind up in Shitty Analton" Norm began to explain like a boomer. "And you don't want to end up there after dark let me tell you. Good thing I lost my entire ass am I right?!" he said slapping Gunk on the back.

Soon after not going too far past Analton they reached yet another cave.

"This whole place is just fucking caves" Axewound complained.

"Isn't it GREAT!?" Norm said smiling.

As they entered the dark wet cave Axewound had to test a few foot holds in her six inch heels. Gunk lit a torch that was made out of a leg bone.

"Remind me to thank Gerome for the leg torch when we see him" Norm whispered to Gunk.

Finally after hours of decending into some kind of underworld, the 3 made it to an entirely open cavern with pillars as big as my totally real giant peener. 

"Whoaaa" Gunk said as he looked up admiring the architecture like a true dwarven stereotype.

"Sup guys!" Norm shouted.

"NOOOOOOOOOOORM" shouted a literal hoard of skelemen. There were skelemen, Skelewomen, Skeledogs, Skelemonks, and even a few Skelecats. But on the wall was a sign with Ghostbusters circle and line that said "NO SKELE VULTURES".

"Oh I see you've made some new friends!" Gerome the Skeleman said addressing Gunk and Axewound. "Are they here to pray to the almighty?" 

"Yes! This is Gunk and Axle Foley." Norm said mixing up the two's names and pointing to the wrong person.

"Hard pass" Axewound said bluntly.

"Sweetheart...." Gunk gritted his teeth. "It woulnd't hurt to pay our respects. After all Norm here promised us some water, didn't you Norm?"

"Oh yes right over there you can drink as much cave juice as you can!" Norm said pointing to a brackish still water ravine filled with dead animals.

"HARDER PASS" Axewound said grimacing.

"Eh....I've drunk worse" Gunk said pouring himself a mug of cave juice.

Axewound felt a chill down her spine. He magic still wasn't up to speed after all that she'd been through. Even eating that delicous Pirate Cheese didn't restore all of her mana. She was not used to such weakness. It disgusted her. She was THE QUEEN after all.

"Woooooooorship meeeee.....shooooww mee theeeem tiiiiiiiddies" she heard a whisper on the wind.

"What the hell?" She turned to Gunk and punched him in the shoulder.

"OW what the FUCK MY CAVE JUICE" he said trying not to spill the rancid water.

"It wwwwwaasn't hiiiiim youuuuu dummmmmb biiiiiiiiiiiaaaatch it wassss meeeeeee" Axewound heard again faintly. She turned to look down a long dark cavern hallway. She squinted to adjust her eyes as she saw a faint glowing red thrum.

"Ahhh I see you are ready to see OUR LORD" Gerome said ushering her and Gunk down the dark cavern.

In the darkness behind a large pillar a hooded figure stood and slinked back into the dark as to not be seen by Axewound and Gunk. They reached their cloaked hand up and adjusted their hood as they stealthily made their way through the pitch blackness and followed the 2 new guests.

As Gunk and Axewound entered the most holy of holies Skelemen and SKelewomen were on their knees praying and chanting in weird skeletal chatterings. Some were having an orgy on rocks and dirt which are like pillows for skeletons. Think about it. The fervor of the worshipping was in tune with the thrumming and humming of a giant red orb up on a pillar. It was mounted inside of it like a gem stone. 

"How are these skeletons fucking...." Gunk asked aloud. "LIke....what's going into what? Ya know?" He turned to Axewound who was transfixed on the object.

"Axe I said....ya KNOW?!" He nudged her.

She wasn't paying attention to him or anyone as a great slitted eye rolled into view from the left to right on the orb. It stared at Axewound as if it knew her. The Skelemen all bowed and prayed even harder or whatever it is people in a cult do...I MEAN RELIGION. They began to fawn over Axewound as the Orb lifted her body up and covered it in a red haze. The haze solidified and transformed into a giant red cloak that kind of looked like a fruit roll up.

Ugla snapped awake.

"WE HAVE TO MOVE!" She shouted as she kicked sand into the open fire they had made out in the desert.

"69 more minutes, Mom" Squib said as he rolled back onto his other side.

"GET. UP." She kicked him twice for each word.

"FUCK FINE I'M UP" he yelled rubbing sleep for his eyes.

"MEW MEW" Buffcat was already packed and ready to go. Demi was close behind. She shoo'd Jelly into her pack and strapped it and her sword to her back.

"OVER THERE" Ugla shouted as she pointed to a cave entrance.

"We should have never taken that detour through Shitty Analton" Squib said rubbing his butt. "WAIT  WAIT FOR ME" he shouted as the rest of the group were already near the cave entrance.

_______________________

"SHE'S THE ONE" Shouted a skeleman in mid orgasm. 

"She HAS THE SIGHT" another skelewoman said as she knelt down and kissed Axewound's feet.

"This is getting hot" Gunk said as he was probably into feet.

Just then 4 ancient runes replaced the eye. Ancient dwarvish runes.

"Hey I know those" Gunk said still thinking about feet kind of.

Axewound was still entranced. Her eyes slid back into her head as only the whites of them could be seen as she arched her back and stared straight up at the cavern cieling. As she floated skelemen praised her and bowed reverently.

"My ancient dwarf is pretty rusty but I think it says...Q.....U....N...T...." Gunk spelled out. Just then more ancient runes began to sprawl across the orb. "Quantum Unit Network Teleporter" Gunk read aloud.

"OH DIP ITS THE THING WE NEED" he shouted. "AXE WAKE UP ITS THE THING!"

"NOT SO FAST YOU RAGING NECRO CUNT" SHouted Ugla as the thrum of the deivice stopped and dropped Axewound to the floor. She super her knelt there as steam rose from her body which was now draped in a new red leather outfit even sexier than her last black one.

"If it isn't the bearded BITCH" Axewound said bitterly as she rose to her feet.

"MEW" BUffcat said as he snicked his claws out and waved his mace tail menacingly.

"I have been recharged and maybe REBORN!" Axewound shouted as a deafening echo reverberated through everyone in the cavern.

"ITS HER!" Shouted a skeleman. "THE GOLD ONE'S CHAMPION!"

"Yessssss it is me! Queen AXEWOUND" she flung her arms out as if bathing in the adoration. "Get these pissants out of my sight!" she shouted.

Just then every skeleman and woman in the cavern gathered up like a crackling zombie hoard. Some were using their own leg bones as baseball bats and doing that thing where you hit the bat against your hand to look tough. Others were filing their finger bones into pointy stabby finger bones. And yet others were just growling and being weird because thats what living in a cave does to you.

Buffcat was already on the attack. He had smashed several skelemens skulls in with his tail whip move that he learned from Pokemon Blue. Demi was sneaking around on the floor. She looked up and saw the red glowing orb pulsating with more and more power. She deftly snuck past some leg bones and rolled behind a rock. She peered upward to see the eye had returned and it was searching....

Squib was firing off arrow after arrow. He had gotten pretty good using Farm Boys old bow. He cracked an arrow right through a skeleman's eye socket knocking his head clean off. As it hit the ground he simply said "OH GREAT A LITTLE HELP HERE" but nobody cared about him because he actually sucked and was a bad friend to most people.

Ugla fired a blue lighting bolt right at Axewound. Axewound held out a hand expecting to easily block the bolt but instead it crackled into several directions and struck her sides.

"FUCKIN SNAP CRACKLE BITCH" Axewound shouted as she returned a volley of red necro magic back at Ugla. Ugla spun her staff and deflected most of the bolts but as one bolt got close to hitting her, Sandles turned into a sword and deflected it.

Axewound cackled an evil laugh as she backed up against the pillar holding the QUNT. Gunk was stunned. He stood stock still as everything hit him all at once. The room deafened to him as he began to cry. What would his friends think of him now? Where were they?

"Duncan..." Gunk said quietly.

"ENOUGH OF THIS PUSSY TEASING" Axewound shouted as Ugla's hellfire spell absorbed into Axewound's open palm. "HAHAHAHAHAH" she scream laughed as she rose up toward the QUNT.

"GUNKY! LETS ROLL" She shouted down to Gunk snapping him out of of his inaction.

Axewound used her magics to program in a location on the QUNT. With ease she lifted Gunk up and held him in her arm as she reached out and plucked the giant orb from the pillar. 

"SEE YOU NEXT SCREW YOU'S DAY" Axewound said laughing as the device opened a portal.

"YOOOOOINK" Demi said as he popped down from the pillar above and grabbed onto the device. But it was too late. WIth a single flash and zoop they were gone. Axewound, Gunk, and Demi.

"No.....NO" Ugla screamed.

"Well....that was a fun religion while it lasted" Said Norm as he dusted himself off. "Who wants CAVE JUICE?!"

"DEMI!!!!" Yelled Ugla

Buffcat held out a single paw and touched Ugla's shoulder.

"DEMIIIIIII" Shouted Squib as if his high pitched annoying ass could be heard over space and time better than Ugla's. Or maybe he too was just shouting out of desperation and sadness.

"I....I can tell you where they went" a quiet voice form the shadows said quitly and shadowy.

Ugla shook herself back to reality and squinted into the darkness. From out of hte shadows stood a hooded figure in a monk style cloak. They slowly raised their hands to pull back the hood to reveal.....

"......GARY!?!" Ugla said in shock

TO BE QUNTINUED
