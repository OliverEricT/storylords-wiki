	Ep 41
</p>
<p>
	Laboratories and Cucumbers
</p>
<p>
	The suns arose over Daranos like a giant cosmic boner causing everyone to go 'whoa cool' while yawning because it was early. In a nearby tree a batple hung upside down ready for sleep. A fur beetle scurried underground at the sound of a distant screechy hawk going "SKREEEEE" because we use stock sound effects on this show. A mirkmonk was already awake sweeping his tree stump door step while a robin chirped next door. The mirkmonk stopped and looked over at the robin and gave him the "slit throat" sign. All was right in the world.
</p>
<p>
	Demi awoke slowly to the sound of Ugla already packing up camp. How many episodes has this happened, she thought to herself. Surely its gotta be like 4 by now. Buffcat returned to camp and threw down a slew of fishes near the fire.
</p>
<p>
	"Mewmew" he said as he began to gut them with a single long claw. Jelly slorped over to help by absorbing the discarded guts. He was like a portable trash compactor or like yo mama's sweet crotch hole in that you could stick anything inside of there and eventually it'd slowly disolve into nothing both physically and more often than not, emotionally. 
</p>
<p>
	"Get up sleeping doodies, today we get to Graal." Ugla said firmly but with a note of happiness in her voice. Demi hadn't heard that tone in weeks. It almost sounded like hope.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh we're so close I can almost taste it in the back of my bung hole" Squib said.
</p>
<p>
	"Mewmew mew mew mew mew?" Buffcat asked.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah because that's how close we are" Squib said as if that was a stupid question.
</p>
<p>
	"Alright I dont want any fuckery or skullduggery or fuckwittery or dumbfuckery going on today." Ugla said firmly. "We're getting to Graal today and so help me Dickless ORCHRIST if anything stupid happens today I will teleport anyone who gets in our way directly to the Pain Mines. Do not pass go. Do not collect 200 boar skins or whatever the fuck people use for money in this dumb universe."
</p>
<p>
	"Got it, no skull fucking" Demi said taking mental note.
</p>
<p>
	As they trudged along the old worn paths in the woods Ugla could almost smell the spices in the air coming from The Big Battple herself. She breathed in the fresh air and exhaled pausing to take in the moment. She hadn't felt this good in a long time when suddenly she heard a rustle in the branches.
</p>
<p>
	"HELP ME SOMEONE HELP ME" screamed an old peasant man.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh no..." Demi said half smiling.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew mew mew mewmew" Buffcat said.
</p>
<p>
	A single pumping vein began to throb in Ugla's forehead as an emaciated old peasant man leaned over, out of breath.
</p>
<p>
	"Help me..." he wheezed in and out. "I've been tracking my long lost puppy for days could you possibly...." But before he could finish Ugla had already opened up a portal to the Pain Mines and was readying her staff to push him in. 
</p>
<p>
	"WHHHHYYYYYYYY" he screamed as he zooped out of this reality.
</p>
<p>
	"Wow you weren't kiddin around were you?" Squib asked.
</p>
<p>
	"Lets go" Ugla said firmly.
</p>
<p>
	"But....that guys puppy....?" Demi asked confused.
</p>
<p>
	"Demi. He was an old man looking for his puppy in the woods at like 8 o'clock in the morning. He was most definitely a predator. I'm surprised he didn't say he had candy rubies in his bone van down by the river" Ugla said pushing on.
</p>
<p>
	"Ooooo candy rubies I love those and their cinnamony goodness!" Demi said kind of zoning out thinking about candy now.
</p>
<p>
	"Look kid." Ugla said moving branches away from her face. "You're gonna have to learn that people in this time aren't all nice. Don't believe everyone just because they SEEM like they are innocent and kind. When we get to Graal I'll get you a candy puppy or a ruby bonevan or whatever you want"
</p>
<p>
	"I wonder if there are green rubies that are apple flavored or even better LIME FLAVORED!" Demi said in wonderment having already moved on because kids are fairly stupid and obliviouis to anything around them.
</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile in the Pain Mines a single old man zooped in and immediately is chained up and put to work.
</p>
<p>
	"Back to WOIK YA PEDERASS" shouted a guard.
</p>
<p>
	"I'll get you for this Ugla" said the old man knowing her name for some reason. "I'll get you and your sexy little goblin friend too" he said pervly. "Aren't...aren't you gonna whip me?" the old man asked the guard.
</p>
<p>
	"EW NO" said the guard turning and leaving.
</p>
<p>
	"This truly is.....HEEEEEEEEEECK!" he screamed.
</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile meanwhile, Ugla pushed bramble and brush away and sighed with relief. There in the distance was Graal. The morning haze covered most of the city like a fine film of familiar stank on your favorite shirt that your girlfriends giant tits have stretched out making it impossible for you to wear anymore or like the clear plastic film on a new piece of electronics that is so satisfying to peel off.
</p>
<p>
	"We made it" Ugla said relieved.
</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile while this meanwhile was happening Sid and Peppercorn strolled down a busy merchant street in Graal.
</p>
<p>
	"I'll take 2, Guissepi" Sid said holding up 2 fingers. "Thanks. Here Pep. It's called Stickle"
</p>
<p>
	"It's just a pickle on a stick" Peppercorn said turning the Stickle over and examining it.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah isn't it great!?" Sid said almost deepthroating the Stickle like he were on a Brazzers set (BRAAAZZZERS)
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah I feel like I'm paying more for the novelty though ya know?" Peppercorn said pessimistically. "Like I can just eat the pickle with my hands I dont really need the stick and like...Its just a pickle ya know? Its not even deep fried or have those oreo crumbs on it or turn you into a chair or anything"
</p>
<p>
	"Hmmm" Grumbled Guissepi.
</p>
<p>
	"Thanks Guissepi" Sid said handing him a coin.
</p>
<p>
	"No Problem" said the orc.
</p>
<p>
	"COME IN FLAMINGOS THIS IS MAYOR PIZZA OVER" a voice came over Sids All See Ball.
</p>
<p>
	"He does know he doesn't need to say over right?" Peppercorn scoffed.
</p>
<p>
	"This is Sid Mayor Pizza what can we do for you?" Sid responded holding up his all see ball image of Mayor Joey Pizza still wearing his Mayoral sash from his innaguration that read "Mayor in the Streets Slayer in the Sheets".
</p>
<p>
	"I need you to go down to Zug's Various Sundries and Wares and uh...take care of something for me" The Mayor said weirdly.
</p>
<p>
	"Uhhh do you mean like...do an errand for you or like...'take care' in quotes" Sid asked.
</p>
<p>
	"He's got a lot of antiques in that shop and I at least want to know if he's got anything that could like...change the fabric of time and space as we know it" The mayor gesticulated itallianly.
</p>
<p>
	"The 69th Amendment nuts aren't gonna be happy about that, your mayorness" Sid said.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm not taking away their right to transform themselves into having bear arms or use magic to do super cool shit and stuff, as it says in the sacred scroll the Cumstitution." The mayor over explalined for the audience having now invensted a paragraph into this qoute unquote joke. "Just go take a look around. We've been hearing rumors of a heist and I won't have that in my city......"he paused...."unless its me and MY crew doing the heisting cappice!?"
</p>
<p>
	"We're on our way, Mr. Mayorness" Sid said.
</p>
<p>
	"MAYOR OUT" Joey said hanging up the all see call.
</p>
<p>
	"So, we're going antiqueing this epsisode?" Peppercorn asked breaking the fourth wallery.
</p>
<p>
	As Sid opened the old creaky door to Zug's a tiny little jingle bell tinkled above his head.
</p>
<p>
	"Come in come in" A friendly deep dwarven voice came from somewhere between the rows and rows of junk. It was like the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark fucked a Best of Hoarders marathon on TLC in this place. So basically every antique shop ever in the history of antique shops.
</p>
<p>
	"How can I help ye today?" Asked the voice.
</p>
<p>
	"We're ANTIQUING!" Peppercorn responded dripping with sarcasm.
</p>
<p>
	"...for the Mayor." Sid interjected.
</p>
<p>
	Out from behind a stack of ancient looking texts popped a gray haired dwarf who's face was saggier than yo sweet mama's front and back fupas.
</p>
<p>
	"Ah yes the Mayor. It's his anniversary soon if I recall." Zug the Dwarf said. "To his third mistress I believe."
</p>
<p>
	"Hot" Peppercorn said to nobody. Sid nudged him in his side.
</p>
<p>
	"We're more here on business" Sid said pointing to a pin on his lapel. There was the Pin of the Hand of the Mayor. It was a lot like the pin for Hand of the King from Game of Thrones but this one the hand was upright with a single middle digit erected skyward.
</p>
<p>
	"Ah yes Mr. The Rogue. I am of cource, here to serve and if you need anything...special I'm sure we can procure that for you and for his Mayoralness" Zug said with a wink.
</p>
<p>
	"And I'm here too" Peppercorn said pointing to his lapel where he had pinned the Stickle onto hismelf because there was no way he was gonna finish the whole thing. Peppercorn gave a wink and a clicking sound with his mouth.
</p>
<p>
	"Okay....?" Zug said.
</p>
<p>
	"We've been told that you may have...some powerful artifacts that could be on the all see-dar of some very unsavory people. We're just here to check them out. We're not here to take them away don't worry. No need to get all Clanuary 6th on us." Sid said.
</p>
<p>
	Zug laughed. "Don't worry young man I'm not going to. There's stuff in here from the old world. I dont even know what some of it does. I delved deep and hard to find  most of this stuff." Zug picked up an ancient looking hand held glass tablet.
</p>
<p>
	"Whoa its like a ball-les all see ball!" Peppercorn said instantly fascinated.
</p>
<p>
	"I was able to turn it on once..." Zug said. "Had some text up about how 'scientists' invented 'white people' and how they became gorillas? And how these 'white people' share 99% of genetic material with gorilas? I dont know..." Zug said.
</p>
<p>
	"Funny, I shared 100% of my genetic material with yo mama last night" Peppercorn said to himself.
</p>
<p>
	"What about this over here?" Sid asked pointing to a golden sword lodged inside of a great big stone. It glowed in golden beauty.
</p>
<p>
	"That's Sexcalibur." Zug said matter of factly. "A legendary weapon that allows its weidler to be good at sex and fucking and fingering and so forth..." Zug trailed off.
</p>
<p>
	"Do you have to be holding the sword while boning?" Peppercorn asked completely logically and speaking for all of us in the audience.
</p>
<p>
	"OH yes" Zug replied. "But if a lover won't let your hold a sword while he or she is face down ass up spread full cheeks doggy, is it even worth being with said lover?"
</p>
<p>
	"Fair point..." Sid said.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh this might be of interest to you, Comedy Gnome" Zug said gesturing for Peppercorn to follow. On a shelf deep in the back of the shop sat a dusty mechanical looking device about the size of a radio. It had 2 large antennae jutting from either side at about the size of a small computer monitor.
</p>
<p>
	"The ancients called this a 'Quantum Communicator'. They experimented with early magic to try and communicate across great distances instananeously." Zug flipped a tiny frankenstein switch on the side of the device as static filled the space between the two antennae.
</p>
<p>
	"PFFFFFT" Peppercorn scoffed. "Yeah its called 'AN ALL SEE BALL'" He laughed. "How did these Cave dwelling rock humpers even wipe their own butts am I right?" He said as they all chuckled at how stupid people were back then.
</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile Ugla and the gang made their way up to the font gates of Graal. Ugla could barely contain her excitement and ran up the closed gate. Weird. But not unheard of for the gate to be closed this early. Maybe all this haze made it hard for the merchants to sell their wares?
</p>
<p>
	She knocked on the gate. No response.
</p>
<p>
	"Hmmm" She said getting a little anxious. "HUUUUUGE MELLONS" She chanted the ancient opening spell. Finally the gates gaped open wider than yo sweet mama's back meat last night while you were at your friend Kyle's house.
</p>
<p>
	The dust from the gates covered her eyes and she  coughed out and squinted through the haze. There it stood. Graal.....completely destroyed.
</p>
<p>
	"Wh..." she choked. "How....this....this can't be" 
</p>
<p>
	"Maybe they're redecorating for our return?" Squib said stupidly optimistically.
</p>
<p>
	Demi looked through the fog to see buildings long destroyed. Demi knew it all too well. It looked like  her  home. It looked like her future. On the streets people shambled along like day walkers in need of a bump of blood. Zombies who's lives had long ago ended but were just too stubborn to give up shuffling along. Their lives a living LMFAO song stuck on repeat.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla dropped to her knees and began to sob. This was her home. For all of its problems and polution and stank faced bitchyness and uncontrolled poverty and the water tasting like lead and no free parking on Sunsdays....this was her home she loved.
</p>
<p>
	"YOU BLEW IT UP....YOU MANIACS BLEW IT UP!" She screamed.
</p>
<p>
	Buffcat came over and laid a paw gently on Ugla's shoulder.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew mew" he said. Ugla gripped the dust in her hand and clenched it into her fist. After all this time. After all those stupid episodes of saving towns all along the road to Graal what was it for? What was any of this for?
</p>
<p>
	"CUCUMBERS HERE GET YOUR CUCUMBERS ON A STICK!" a street vendor shouted over the din of mumbling depressed patrons.
</p>
<p>
	Demi walked over and purchased one for a gold coin having no idea how valuable gold is or was since she was a kid and like I said earlier oblivious to such trivialities.
</p>
<p>
	"My THANK YOU young miss" The street vendor said biting into the coin to make sure it wasn't lead. Demi chomped into the cucumbers juicy watery goodness as she let the flavorless watery boringness of the FRUIT wash over her. Just like most FRUITS she had been introduced to this FRUIT was definitely a FRUIT and not a VEGETABLE. Good thing this FRUIT had so much flavor and wasn't boring as fuck at all in every way and just used as filler in house salads at pizza places.
</p>
<p>
	"Mmm pretty good" She said. The vendor bowed a humble bow. "Could use a bit of pickling though. Like if you could pickle this thing and put it on a stick..."
</p>
<p>
	"My....my god" the vendor said. "That is the single greatest idea in the history of ideas. YOUNG LADY YOU ARE A CULLINARY GENIUS"
</p>
<p>
	"yeah I know" Demi said finishing off her delicious fruit that definitely isn't a vegetable.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla was drawing runes in the dust and using her magic much to the shock of the patrons in the dusty square. 
</p>
<p>
	"Alright" she said firmly standing up pulling herself together. "Looks like we're in the wrong time. That IDIOT Reeses sent us to the wrong FUCKING time period."
</p>
<p>
	"But are we before now or are we after now?" Squib said weirdly poetically.
</p>
<p>
	Back at Zugs shop Peppercorn and Zug were wrist deep in ancient electronic parts. 
</p>
<p>
	"This one goes here and that one goes there, right?" Peppercorn said firmly.
</p>
<p>
	Sid let out a sigh. "Mr. Zug I'm sorry we've wasted your time but I just dont see anything here that would be worth all of this worry. Not that your shop isn't....full of very usefull and cool shi...stuff"
</p>
<p>
	"Tis not a worry lad. I'm just glad to have had the company. Gets lonely in here with all this ancient junk. I was starting to feel ancient myself." Zug said with a toothless grin of an old ass man who forgot his dentures at Denny's.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly an explosion rocked the entire shop. Junk and cabinets and fuckin old signs that nobody cares the fuck about flew everywhere. In slow motion Sid could see Zug's wrinkled old skin flap wildly as the force of the shock wave hit his craggy ass old dirty face. In an instant Zug flew backwards and slammed against an old shelf knocking everything off it like Marty McFly when he turns it up to 11.
</p>
<p>
	Peppercorn deftly grabbed the machine and ducked under a fallen bookshelf. Sid shook off the effects of the exlposion as fire blazed hot on his face, his ears ringing with the hum of a thousand high pitched screechy hawks. As he focused he looked up to the now roofless antique shop. There in all her pin up hotness was Axewound a top Axl the Dragon.
</p>
<p>
	"You fucking BITCH" Sid said with a spit.
</p>
<p>
	"Awww Siddy" Axewound tutted. "Had I known you been in this building I would have made sure to topple it all at once. But alas I do need something from inside so if you're done browsing would you please make your final purchases and head STRAIGHT TO HECK" she shouted.
</p>
<p>
	"Axl?" Peppercorn whispered. "69 time Gammy Award winning Metal Mozart Axl the Dragon?"
</p>
<p>
	"MEW MEW" Socks lept from Sid's back and into his hand still in sword form. With a howl Axewound pulled on the golden reigns of Axl's bit and he blew out blue hot dragonfire straight at Sid.
</p>
<p>
	Sid held out Socks firmly like a fuckin samurai. As the flames hit they separated into a fucking dope as hell V shape around him. Socks absorbing most of the heat and deflecting the rest. They both were unscathed.
</p>
<p>
	"Looks like someone learned how to deflect BITCH FIRE" Sid said with a smile.
</p>
<p>
	"What happened to you Siddy?" Axewound goaded. "You used to be so fun. WE used to be so fun"
</p>
<p>
	"What the fuck are you talking about I've never even been in the same story as you I dont think..." Sid said thinking and hoping someone puts that on the wiki so he could look it up later.
</p>
<p>
	"Not yet we haven't, Stud" Axewound winked. She reared Axl around. The flapping of his wings causing scrolls and detritus to blow like a tornado.
</p>
<p>
	"Come in....anyone out there COME IN. CHIC PEA WE NEED HELP. FREDDO? COME IN ANYONE.....FLYMAN?...Eh you know what not you Flyman if you're out there we're good" Peppercorn shouted into the ancient communication device.
</p>
<p>
	Back in his room Flyman's all see ball was blowing up.
</p>
<p>
	"Finally....my friends are texting me!" He said almost happily. He slowly read the text form of Peppercorns plea and got to the end.
</p>
<p>
	"Ohhhhhh" he said and sulked back to bed. Blowing the candles out and covering his face with the blankets. It was 9am.
</p>
<p>
	Peppercorn ducked as a giant dragon claw wrenched the bookshelf from atop him.
</p>
<p>
	"There you are little pervert!" Axewound said. "Give me the device and I won't burn this entire city to the ground."
</p>
<p>
	"Gulp" said Peppercorn audibly as the massive claw of Axl decended ready to rend Peppercorn into shredded meats. 
</p>
<p>
	"My only regret is that I never got to use....Sexcalibur" Peppercorn said as he closed his eyes.
</p>
<p>
	"Hel....Hello? WHo....who is thi......sccchhhch" the device crackled to life. "This is....Wizar.....Ugla.....Who is this......"
</p>
<p>
	"This is Peppercorn the Tinker here with Sid the Rogue. We're under attack from Princess Cuntwound. SEND HELP NOW" Peppercorn replied.
</p>
<p>
	"SID....here? Where.....need locatio....telepor....schshshsh. Tell him.....hang..on.....and that......love.....him"
</p>
<p>
	ZOOOOOOOOOOP
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly a purple portal zooped into existence and a tiny arm reached in and grabbed Peppercorn pull him to safety but not before hte dropped the device.
</p>
<p>
	"YESSSSS YESSSSSSS YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS" Axewound said as Axl picked up the device.
</p>
<p>
	"I'll have what she's having" Guiseppi the Pickle Orc said from outside.
</p>
<p>
	Axewound was already gaining altitude with Axl and hovering over Graal like death on wings.
</p>
<p>
	"Always love a good day of antiquing" She said with a cackle.
</p>
<p>
	"You evil BITCH" Sid shouted up at her.
</p>
<p>
	"Later masturbator!" Axewound said as she opened a golden portal and zooped out of dodge.
</p>
<p>
	Sid helped Zug up from the rubble. He was bleeding but Dwarves were tough. Peppercorn and Chic Pea zooped back into the shop and quickly ran over to Sid.
</p>
<p>
	"Like....what the hell happened here?" Chic Pea asked.
</p>
<p>
	"Sid....SID someone on the device knew who you were!" Peppercorn was rambling faster than his mind could compute the sitution.
</p>
<p>
	"She she she said that she needed your location and she was a wizard named Ugly Tits or something..I I I don't know she said she loved you? Did you fuck an ugly titted Wizard at some point and not tell me about it? Because that's QUITE LITERALLY something I would REALLY want to hear about man? I thought we were friends dude what the hell? Were they saggy or like...dinner plate nipples? How many tits are we talking like an odd number? Like 5? Did she have 5 hidiously deformed tiddies? SID ANSWER ME!"
</p>
<p>
	"Ugla....wait....no her tits are great. LIke really great. Like I could draw them but I'm not good at boobs or hands yet." Sid said.
</p>
<p>
	"We have to go after Axecunt...and like....kill her or whatever. I dont know what she would want with some old rusted out shitbox but it can't be good." Chic Pea said.
</p>
<p>
	"We have to let Ugla know where we went...If she returns to Graal. We need to let her know we heard her and we're going after Axewound." Sid rubbed his aching back.
</p>
<p>
	"We dont' even know where WE'Re going" Peppercorn said.
</p>
<p>
	"If we find Axewound and get the device we can contact Ugla. She's a wizard. She has great magical powers and she will find us. We just need the device. So wherever Axewound went, as long as we can find her, Ugla will find us." Sid reasoned.
</p>
<p>
	"Like right but...that means we have to find Princess CrackSpoon first" Chic said.
</p>
<p>
	"First things first we need to leave a marker. Some kind of message for Ugla here. In case she returns here. I think I have an idea...." Sid said picking up an ancient spray paint can from teh rubble.
</p>
<p>
	"My....gret is not.....Sexcalibur" a voice came from Ugla's All See Ball.
</p>
<p>
	"Hello?" Ugla said fumbling to hold out the all see ball. "Hello who is this? This is the wizard Ugla! Repeat who is this!?" Ugla said with hope in her voice. Someone here could communicate with all see magic. That means someone here could help them possibly.
</p>
<p>
	Buffcat and Squib were checking out the nearby merchants. Nothing but old vegetables I MEAN FRUITS. OLD FRUITS for sale and other various oddities. Buffcats ears perked up and turned toward Ugla as he tuned into her converstation on the all see ball. He heard the word Sid. 
</p>
<p>
	"MEW!" he said cheerily.
</p>
<p>
	By now the crowd of patrons had taken notice of this wizard using rune magic and talking to a magical ball. They started murmering and muttering. They slowly gathered around her like a flock of seaguls to a barber who will cut your hair into anything or any shape.
</p>
<p>
	Buffcat turned to look at a giant wall behind the merchants. I was one of the only walls left standing in the entire city. The dust began to clear as the morning haze and dust storms slowed down. Buffcat squinted at an ancient looking drawing marking the wall in some kind of graffiti.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew MEW MEWWWWW" he said.
</p>
<p>
	"Tell him to...hang on!" Ugla shouted into the all see ball. "And that I.....I love him!" then the all see ball blinked off.
</p>
<p>
	"What the hell" Ugla said as all around here the patrons of the merchants and the merchants themselves were now on their hands and knees praying before her. Some were chanting and crying. Others were lifting their arms up to the sky and thanking whatever god or gods they believed in. Then through the fog and dust Ugla saw it. On the wall behind them was a giant graffiti depiction of her. And sid. And a Fred....and two gnomes she didn't know and FLYMAN!
</p>
<p>
	She choked up and smiled. There they were. Her friends. Her Sid.
</p>
<p>
	TO BE CUMTINUED
</p>
