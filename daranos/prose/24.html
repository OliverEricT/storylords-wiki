	The Pillar
</p>
<p>
	Let's face it. Daranos is a Cum Dumpster just waiting for you to secretly throw away your empties from the party you had last night so your mom wouldn't find out and come home and say "Boys! If you're gonna have a party I would prefer you do it where you take everyone keys so's they have to stay over. And then you hand out the keys and if you get the persons key you have sex with that person like we did in the 70s. Ahhhh the 70s. Birth Control Pill AND NO HIV!?!?! Who wasn't getting cummed in? Not me. Your mother who is still speaking to you." End quote.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla found herself once again climbing up an impossibly steep and deadly mountain. At this point you could write a paper about how her adversity was sybomolized by all of these treacherous ass climbs she had to do and that overcoming the impossible was a theme in her life at this point. But she sure didn't feel that way.
</p>
<p>
	"Mountains. Fuckin.....SUCK" She breathed out heavily as she gripped another hand hold. On her back her white staff and white Katana blended in with the snow that was billowing all around her like she was in a cocaine blender.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" Sandals the katana mewed from her back.
</p>
<p>
	"You're sure this is the way we need to go? There wasn't like a different quest we could have taken to like Bermuda or like...the Titty Islands where everyone shows they titties and its normal as hell but not stupid like in France because there aren't any French there?"
</p>
<p>
	Sandals thought for a second. Or so Ugla thought since the sword remained silent.
</p>
<p>
	"MEW" the sword said.
</p>
<p>
	"Fine. But I swear to got if I fall AGAIN I'm going to haunt whatever sick God or Gods is controling this adventure...." SNAP
</p>
<p>
	Just then Ugla's hand slipped from the icy hand hold and she fell downward yelling obsenities all the way. Thats what you get for questioning a God. Maybe next time just be glad we're not fired and go on your adventure. I promise it'll be worth it. Nothing worth doing is  easy or so the boomers say and look at them! They pulled themselves up a mountain both ways by their own bootstraps.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla landed on a small outcropping several tens of feet down the mountain with a snap.
</p>
<p>
	Sandals transformed back into cat form and began to lick her face giving her healing energies.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah its...ok Sandals ok I'm fine I didn't break anything" She said propping herself up on her hands. She reached inside her satchel and pulled out a broken cookie.
</p>
<p>
	"Can't say the same for my Limb Ass Bread" she said holding up a broken ass shaped cookie. That's LIMB ASS BREAD. Brought to you by Kreebler Elves. Do YOU eat ass? One bite will fill you all day long. Now in ass shapes of your favorite Daranosian heroes! Michael J'Orcdon, Bone Jackson, and FLURB! Just remember kids there's no such thing as too much ass! 
</p>
<p>
	Can an ass be  considered a limb? I sure have seen some that should be classified as such. What were we talking about? Oh right....
</p>
<p>
	Ugla pushed herself upwards and dusted off her robes. Sandals rubbed against her leg lovingly glad to see Ugla was indeed alright. Just then a loud rumble thundered through the sky. Ugla looked up but could only see the snow falling fast and hard downward into her face like she was swinging on a swing set and pretending she was going Warp 9 in Star Trek.
</p>
<p>
	Then, a terrible fell voice could be heard on the wind.
</p>
<p>
	"OH YEAH ROCK ME DADDY ROCK ME" The voice said
</p>
<p>
	"YEAH I'M GONNA ROCK YOU ALL NIGHT LONG" Anotoher voice said as the thundering got louder and louder. Rhythmically loud like someone was banging a rock drum or maybe someone was banging a rock's ass if rocks had asses.
</p>
<p>
	"SHOOT YOUR ROCKS INSIDE OF ME" The first rock said. Ugla squinted through the snow and blushed a bit. THen she saw it. 2 giant mountain sized rock monsters just fuckin in broad daylight on top of another mountain. The banging was so loud had to have been audible for miles and miles.
</p>
<p>
	Just then in a forest somewhere in the south a Mirkmonk was building a model acorn in a glass bottle. As the first pounding sound hit his ears he jerked his hand and the entire model acorn crumbled into a mess of parts inside the bottle.
</p>
<p>
	"MOTHER. FUCKER!" The Mirkmonk yelled throwing his little mirkmonk sized jewelers glass to the ground. As another pounding sound hit the house the model acorn righted itself back into an acorn.
</p>
<p>
	"Huh...well....ok then" He said. Again another pound hit and the acorn then crumbled into a model of a ship.
</p>
<p>
	"You know what....fuck this I'm gonna go jerk off" The mirkmonk said and then he did indeed jerk off.
</p>
<p>
	"I'M GONNA ROCK" The rock man said as he rocked slid all over the other rock monster. And that is how mountains are born. Dont look it up. Ms. Parco in 6th grade said was plate techtonics but in Daranos its Plate Sextonics.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" Sandals said as she walked over to a wall in the rock face. She looked at it and looked back at Ugla. Ugla walked over and ran her hand over the surface of the stone. Her hands were scraped from the fall and she winced as the sting of pain shot through her. As she left her hand there on teh stone she was expecting the cool rock to soothe her cuts but instead she felt warmth.
</p>
<p>
	"It's warm" She said looking down at socks. Socks mewed and rubbed against her leg again. She could train this human.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla waved her hand and ancient dwarven runes shown a golden yellow through the snow.
</p>
<p>
	"It's a MOONS DOOR" Ugla said excitedly.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" Sandals said looking up at the darkened sky
</p>
<p>
	"No no...it doesn't open when the moons are out. It opens when you MOON it." Without hesitation Ugla pulled up her robes and mooned the door with her pristine wiizard booty that won the Wizard Yale Wet Pantaloons Contest 3 years in a row.
</p>
<p>
	"ENTER" a booming voice said as the stone gave way to a staircase that led down into the mountain.
</p>
<p>
	"See?" Ugla said. "Lets go"
</p>
<p>
	Inside the cavern the howling wind was muted making it sound like a spooky ghost was having an orgasm, but Ugla was undeterred.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla ran her hands along the wall of the staircase as she and Sandles decended into the unknown. As they went downward the cavern got darker and darker. Ugla grabbed for her newly reconstructed staff but before she could Sandals already began to glow a bright yellow light. Her eyes shown bright like 2 flashlights (OR TORCHES IF YOU STILL THINK ITS 1350ad) and wherever she looked they lit up the spot with pinpoint accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh...well that's handy" Ugla said patting the cat on her  glowing head.
</p>
<p>
	Soon they reached a giant cathedral sized room with pillars just like in that movie I'm stealing all this imagery from. Sandles looked around but even her flashlight eyes weren't powerful enough to reach the other side of this enourmous empty cavernous abyss. Ugla picked up a rock on the ground.
</p>
<p>
	"Bottom of the 69th. Bases are loaded. Does Ugla still have enough in the tank to strike out Bone Jackson?" Ugla narrated as she began to pretend to get ready to throw a pitch. 
</p>
<p>
	"She throws a fastball!" Ugla said as she threw the rock into the inky blackness and waited for the sound of it hiting the ground to echo throughout the chamber.
</p>
<p>
	But...no sound ever came.
</p>
<p>
	"WHEEEEEW (Whistle)" She whistled. "That is not ominous AT ALL" 
</p>
<p>
	As she and Sandles made their way through the city sized room she could see no trace of anyone or anything. There were no bodies. There were no books. No indication that anyone had ever lived or even been in this place at any point in time. The emptiness only added to Ugla's anxiety about this whole trip. But Sandles forged ahead turning back every now and again to make sure her new human was following. At least Sandles seemed to know what she was doing, Ugla thought to herself letting  that old warm blanket of self doubt curl around her. She really should talk to a therapist.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly Sandles stopped dead in her tracks. Her ears perked up and backward. She rotated them around listening intently. Ugla turned her head trying to hear whatever it was Sandles was hearing but her human ears weren't as good or cute as Sandles'.
</p>
<p>
	Then, she heard it. Drums. Drums from the deep.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla closed her eyes and let out a long sigh. "Fuuuuuck I hate caves". Sandles ran back toward her and transformed into a gleaming white katana. Ugla held her up and readied herself like a samurai.
</p>
<p>
	 As the drums drew closer and closer Ugla couldn't tell if the pounding in her ears was the drums or her own blood pumping. She gripped Sandles tighter and readied herself.
</p>
<p>
	"AYYYYYY are you headed to the party toooo?" A very drunk female goblin said as an all see jam box busted out the latest goblin beats.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla looked around still ready to defend  herself.
</p>
<p>
	"Coooooool coooooool" The Goblina said. "Look if you get hit on by any annoying Gob-boys just call me over and I'll take them off your hands" she said licking her spindly and warty fingers.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla lowered Sandles as the katana turned back into a regular magical flashlight eyes having cat.
</p>
<p>
	"Ok GURL follow me WOOOOOO GOBLIN DAY 69420!" The Lady Goblin said as she grabbed Ugla by the hand. Soon a bunch of other goblins scurried out of the darkness and put a tiara made of barbed wire on Ugla head and handed her a really strong drink with a swirly straw that ended in 6 different orc penises. Ugla reluctantlly took a sip and recoiled at the flavor.
</p>
<p>
	"YECH what is this, Turpentine!?" She said spitting out the drink
</p>
<p>
	"HEHE turpentine" The Goblina chuckled. "Yeah because we're all RICH enough to afford turpentine. This bitch thinks she the queen of Bogland over here. Oi mate care for a spot of Turpy?"
</p>
<p>
	Soon they reached a room that was bumpin with Goblin jams by Snoop Gobby Gob. Goblins were making out with each other  and some were even making out with themselves.
</p>
<p>
	"WOOO GOBLIN DAY" The Goblina shouted yet again to nobody. Ugla looked around having never seen this amount of writhing wrinkled back meat in her whole life.
</p>
<p>
	The King Goblin was sitting up on his throne just getting twerked on by goblin bitches but they were so emaciated that they couldn't quite get they back into it ya know? You're supposed to shake your thighs but these Golbins looked like they hadn't eaten a decent meal since Hardees was a thing. Look it up.
</p>
<p>
	All this undetered the Goblins as they partied hard. The lady goblins all twerked their weak back meats to real life Goblin Iggy Azalea's Fancy as servers brought out trays and trays of...trash? Just kidding Iggy I know you listen you have a big butt. What were we talking about?
</p>
<p>
	Oh right. Trash? The Goblins all feasted on trash. One Goblin grabbed an old Hardees burger box and just straight up ate it, licking the ancient petrified cheese from the bottom of hte styrophome container.
</p>
<p>
	"SILENCE" the King shouted as the Goblins all calmed down even though some were laughing like Beavis.
</p>
<p>
	"Today we honor our Gods" he went on while scratching a goider on his butt. "And we honor our most important god...THE PILLAR"
</p>
<p>
	"THE PILLAR" all the Goblins said in unicen.
</p>
<p>
	"Okkkayyy" Ugla said quietly to Sandles. 
</p>
<p>
	"Meeeeewwww" Sandles said in reply. 
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly a short brown goblin in a lab coat and nerd glasses ran into the room.
</p>
<p>
	"Wait wait!" He shouted. "Wait everyone listen. We have to stop the party!" the nerd goblin said as he waved a parchment around frantically.
</p>
<p>
	Every Goblin, including the king, groaned and rolled their eyes. Some had several eyes.
</p>
<p>
	"BOOOOO SHUT UP YOU FUCKIN NERD" a Goblin yelled from the back.
</p>
<p>
	"YOU STIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINK" another yelled.
</p>
<p>
	"ANYONE WANNA SWAP WIVES" another yelled for some reason. He had been working up the courage all night to ask someone and he mistakenly thought this was the right time. But it was not. He would later go home and have to have regular non sex pervert sex with his goblin wife who looked like that Nicki Minaj Gremlin from Gremlin's 2. 
</p>
<p>
	"My readings indicate that if we keep up this level of crunkitude that the Pillar's structual integrity will be compromised" The Nerd Goblin said looking at a chart on his parchment.
</p>
<p>
	"BLAH BLASH BLAH STRUCTURAL BLA MY DICK IS SMOOTH AND NOT WRINKLY BLAH BLAH" the Goblina said making fun of this huge dork as everyone at the party laughed.
</p>
<p>
	"SMOOTH DICK" shouted another Gobliln and pointed his busted ass fungus infected finger at the nerd gobliln. Nerd Goblin lowered his head and slowly began to leave the party.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" Sandles nudged Ugla and gestured toward the archway the nerd was sulking through and dragging his research behind him. Ugla swiftly made her way over to him and grabbed his shoudler.
</p>
<p>
	"I suppose you want to make fun of my smooth phalice as well..." He said as he turned around to see the largest woman he had ever seen.
</p>
<p>
	"Tall...." he said
</p>
<p>
	"You...what do you know about this place?" Ugla asked very open endedly.
</p>
<p>
	"Me? I know lots of things. I am the only Goblin Alchemist ever to...well ever" He said prouldly as he pulled up his suspenders. Oh yeah he was wearing Urkel suspenders. Sandles peaked out from over Ugla's shoulder.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh" The nerd said. "That is quite the rodent you got there" he said as he tried to pet Sandles.
</p>
<p>
	She hissed and lowered her head back behind Ugla's.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh well it was nice to meet you Big Lady but I have research to attend to at the Pillar" He said.
</p>
<p>
	"Wait" Ugla demaned. "What is your name?"
</p>
<p>
	"I am Squib" he said pushing ups glasses that were like made out of different parts of bottles and wire.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm Ugla" she said holding out her hand for him to shake. He looked at it and did an awkward fist bump against the back of her outstretched hand. 
</p>
<p>
	"Close enough" Ugla said with a laugh. "Now...show me this PIllar".
</p>
<p>
	Squib led Ugla into a solemn room. The sounds of the party were dulled here but Ugla could feel the vibrations of the bass bumping through the floor. As the beat dropped it rattled a candleabra on the wall and caused it to fall with a clang on the stone floor. Ahead of them was The Pillar.
</p>
<p>
	"Holy shit" Ugla said as she saw it. "This....this is cold steel!" She said turning to Squib.
</p>
<p>
	"This is The Pillar" Squib corrected her. "It's been here ever since us Goblins forged our first sword out of the rusty detritus left here for us by the progenetors." 
</p>
<p>
	Ugla ran a hand over the steel pillar as she looked up. It reached the cathedral cieling about 60 feet above her. It's metal was shaped and warped as if it was spilled into the form it was in while molten. It was smooth and cool and felt good on her hand.
</p>
<p>
	"Do you know how much this is worth?" Ugla turned to Squib who was reading his chart.
</p>
<p>
	"Uhhh what?" He said.
</p>
<p>
	"This is worth more than...well....ANYTHING" Ugla said looking up at the pillar. "I mean like....TRILLIONS of gold"
</p>
<p>
	"GOLD?!?!" Squib said with a laugh. "What would we do with that useless metal. It's soft and shiny. You can't make swords out of it and it will give away your location in the dark."
</p>
<p>
	"Because its shiny?" Ugla asked.
</p>
<p>
	"What? No because it smells like farts" Squib said. "You're not from around here are you?"
</p>
<p>
	"What gave it away?" Ugla said with a laugh.
</p>
<p>
	"There hasn't never been gold in this mountain" Squib said. "At least as far as I know. The Progenators saw fit to gift us with all we'd ever need in the form of trash" Squib said proudly. "Besides it really goes with our whole Diesel Punk Anarchist vibe us Goblins really dig. I mean did you see that one guy out in the party? He had a hollowed out bowling ball for a helm. I didn't even know there was bowling in Daranos?"
</p>
<p>
	Back at the party Megan Thee Stallion, the famous centaur rapper, took the stage and started playing Thot Shit. This caused every single Goblin to completely lose their turpentine addled minds.
</p>
<p>
	"OH GODS NO" Squib shouted as he ran over to what looked like a type writer but it was spitting out numbers and symbols.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly the Pillar began to glow.
</p>
<p>
	"Uhhhhh" Ugla said backing away from it.
</p>
<p>
	"It's never done that before..." Squib said somewhat intrigued.
</p>
<p>
	A single glowing red eye formed in the center of the pillar through the semi translucent metal.
</p>
<p>
	"Old..........." it said
</p>
<p>
	"It's never done that before either" Squib said now backing up in fear.
</p>
<p>
	"I. Am. ANCIENT" it shouted.
</p>
<p>
	Sandles transformed into katana form and Ugla held her up ready for anything. If Megan Thee Stallion wasn't such a bad bitch all of othis could have been avoided. Which I'm sure is something the actual Megan has said to herself countless times. I know she listens. Sup girl I'd eat sushi out of every crack on your body hit me up.
</p>
<p>
	"The resonance of the booty quaking is causing the pillar to deteriorate" Squib said like a total dweebus.
</p>
<p>
	All around them pieces of cold steel fell onto othe floor clanging and crashing like someone dropped the Liberty Bell onto Big Ben and then they had loud bell sex. Is BIg Ben the clock? No it's the bell right? If only someone on this show were from that crazy ass brown eating island.
</p>
<p>
	Sandles mewed. 
</p>
<p>
	"RIIGHT" Ugla said diving out of the way of falling debris. She quickly dodged and rolled sliding toward some pieces of fallen cold steel.
</p>
<p>
	'Yoink" she said as she grabbed a large chunk and put it in her never ending sack of holding all the things TM all rights reserved.
</p>
<p>
	Squib was dumbstruck and fear had taken over  his little nerdly body. He stared upward at the red glow which had now gotten brighter having shed off some of its metalic sarcophagus. Ugla grabbed yet more of the priceless metal thinking about how if Sid were hear he'd talk about buying a bone speed boat with it and tricking it out like the boat from Thunder in Paradise. She smiled at the thought, but then she looked over to see Squib paralyzed in terror.
</p>
<p>
	"(WHISTLE DAD WHISTLE)" she whistled. Squib turned to look over at her. His face was sad. One of his Gods was disintigrating in front of him.
</p>
<p>
	"GET IN THE BAG" she sceamed. But he did not move. She sighed and rolled her eyes. "This is bad idea" she said as she dropped a chunk of metal and ran over to the tiny scared lizard ape.
</p>
<p>
	"GET. IN" She demanded. Squib snapped out of his stupor and did a swan dive into the bag of holding everything or whatever I called it earlier. Inside he clanged around off of all sorts of things. Books, many chunks of cold steel, a brush Ugla hand't used since she was like 23, tampons. You name it.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla turned and held out Sandles whom was now glowing gold against the ever more powerful red gleam of teh pillar's eye.
</p>
<p>
	"The last of the wizend" The eye said. "You.....are......dooooomed" it said as the glow intesified. Ugla felt the hot glow get hotter against her exposed skin. Sandles glowed brighter to counter.
</p>
<p>
	"You....you're" she stuttered squinting her eyes against the light.
</p>
<p>
	"I. am. EVERYTHING" the eye boomed.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla dropped to a knee and faultered as the red hot beam began to glow hotter and hotter. He pale skin blistered in teh sun like that one song by the violent femmes.
</p>
<p>
	"MEW" Sandles mewed at her.
</p>
<p>
	"I can't Sandles" Ugla said struggling."I'm not...I'm not strong enough.....I'm just....I'm not good enough" she said with a tear in her eye.
</p>
<p>
	"MEW MEW MEW" Sandles said glowing brighter and placing a shield around them. The red hot beam shot around he shield in a semi sphere. Where the beam hit the shield blinding magical power arced off into the room causing the room to collapse around them. Inside the bag Squib was sitting at a table eating grapes.
</p>
<p>
	"Wonder if she knows this is in here" he thought to himself.
</p>
<p>
	Outside the heat from the eye was unbearable. Sandles shook in her hand as the cuts on her hands were now covered in red sunburn.
</p>
<p>
	"You......suck.....ASS" Ugla yelled.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew!" Sandles mewed in encouragement.
</p>
<p>
	"You......SUCK...ASS" Ugla yelled again regaining her foothold and standing up again.
</p>
<p>
	The eye laughed and grew brighter.
</p>
<p>
	"YOU SUCK ASS" She yelled one final time. Then everything went white.
</p>
<p>
	The waves of the ocean splashed against Ugla's hot burnt skin. She winced in pain as salty water hit her mouth. She spat it out and awoke with a jolt. 
</p>
<p>
	"(LARGE GASP IN)" 
</p>
<p>
	The waves continued to rhythmically hit her but not violently. They were gentle waves. SHe stood up soaking wet with her robes hanging heavy on her.
</p>
<p>
	"HEY HEY ANYONE ALIVE OUT THERE" a muffled voice came from her satchel.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh shit" Ugla said quickly opening it up and rummaging through the objects in side until she found a wrickly feeling object the size of a gross baby.
</p>
<p>
	Squib shot up and out of the bag.
</p>
<p>
	"Are....are we dead?" he asked looking around. All around them they could only see the beach, teh waves, and the setting sun.
</p>
<p>
	"I dont think so" Ugla said touching her sunburn skin."If we were I dont think this sunburn would hurt as much as it does. I'm like a freshman on spring break" she said making a pained face.
</p>
<p>
	"Thanks for saving me" Squib said resting his hand on her arm. 
</p>
<p>
	"FUCK OUCH" she said. "Don't...sunburn dude" she said. "But...yeah dont' mention it. My track record for keeping anything under 5 feet alive isn't great."
</p>
<p>
	Squib laughed and sat down next to her. 
</p>
<p>
	"Now what?" he said.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla shrugged. She had a bag full of cold steel and an alchemisit who might know something about it but that was it. Down the beach Ugla could see a figure. It was moving toward them.
</p>
<p>
	She sighed. She was too tired to have to try and defend herself again. Whoever this was better be cool or at least boring enough to not want to try and kill her. She stood up with the help of her staff. Sandles climbed onto her back and perked her ears back. Squib stood behind her leg, afraid.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh for god sakes its you again" Reeses said as he saw her. He was dressed in full blown Hawaiian shirt gear liek Merlin from Sword in the Stone.
</p>
<p>
	"Well...come on then we have much to discuss" 
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
