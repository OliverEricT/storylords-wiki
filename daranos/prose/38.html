	The Hot Brown Hand of Justice
</p>
<p>
	 The moons hung over Daranos like that time my balls hung over your face when you asleep. You didn't notice but there they were. Giant and looming. Ugla, Demi, Squib and Buffcat all slept soundly on the forest floor. The night was cool. Cooler than what Buffcat and Demi had been used to. Demi curled up under Buffcat's left arm and Squib under his right.
</p>
<p>
	"NO DADDY DON'T PUT THE DANCE WAND THERE" Squib yelled out obviously having that reoccuring nightmare again. The one where is father makes him stand on top of the family's all see ball and uses a dance wand to make him move to get clearer reception.
</p>
<p>
	The morning was soon upon them. But one of the group was not restful. Ugla sat up having had no to little sleep. She rubbed the bridge of her nose and whiped debris from her beard.
</p>
<p>
	This was the second night in a row she couldn't go to sleep. On her mind was the weight of the world and all she had for companions were an orphan, a goblin with PTSD, and admittidly the strongest cat and possibly strongest being ever to have lived. That was good. But she could use Sid.
</p>
<p>
	She let out a long sigh. "Sid" she said under her breath. She looked up at the stars and wondered if Sid was looking at them too. If he could see them. The polution in Graal was pretty bad what with all the stink lines coming from Little Orcspire. Just never ending stank fart sounds mixed with foghorns going off because that place smells worse than yo mama's front butt. That place really let itself go. Matter of fact does anyone even go there anymore? Does anyone even think about it anymore? What was I talking about?
</p>
<p>
	COCKA DOOODLE SCREWWWWWWWWWWWWW 
</p>
<p>
	A Mechano Rooster heralded the dawn. He then busted out a little tiny trumpet and played that army trumpet song that they play when the army wants you to wake up to do push ups or run around and play army men.
</p>
<p>
	"UGGGGGGHHHHHH" Ugla winced at the sound. She squinted her one eye to meet the sun peircing through the foliage.
</p>
<p>
	Demi stretched her arms above her head and yawned. Ugla was already moving to pack up her bedding and put the fire out.
</p>
<p>
	Buffcat awoke with a jolt and did the zoomies around the camp for a hot second. Buffcat was a morning person. Something Ugla was not.
</p>
<p>
	Squib slept through all of this as he curled himself into a fetal position and was now dreaming about Farm Boy and whimpering. Maybe one day he'd tell his kids about Farm Boy. Or maybe he'd take that memory to his grave always leaving a wedge between he and his loved ones. Them sensing that there was always something more that Squib wasn't telling them until it was too late. Then they'd have to pull the plug on Squib's all heart ball machine and end the nightmares for good.
</p>
<p>
	"Good morning Ugla" Demi said politely. Ugla moved a strand of Demi's hair from her eyes. She had so much energy. The world hadn't yet sucked the life from her eyes and soul.
</p>
<p>
	"Have you fed Jelly yet?" Ugla asked.
</p>
<p>
	"No he doesn't want to eat bread anymore. I think he has a taste for human flesh after we saved that town." Demi looked into her pack at Jelly who was still little yet. He curdled in excitement at her voice.
</p>
<p>
	"Well, I found this old set of keys in that tower we visited. Maybe he'll like those." Ugla reached into her pack and pulled out a circular ring of skeletons keys and tossed it in the backpack that was Jelly's own little mobile apartment.
</p>
<p>
	The keys jingled around as Jelly ferouciously devoured them. The backpack jostling and moving wildly as he did. Then, with a final burp, he was fed.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla leaned wearily against her staff. Sandles the Sword zooped back into cat form only to see that it was morning and zoop herself back into sword form at the sight of the sun.
</p>
<p>
	"Looks like we all could use some breakfast and a pick me up" Ugla said fighting back another yawn.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm sick of eating bread too" Demi said as she slung her flame sword onto her back. "But I sure has butts ain't gonna eat no key ring"
</p>
<p>
	"Thats ok we have that map we took from those foodies who decided to eat that cave of Batples. It was just sitting there on one of the chairs remember?" Ugla pulled out an old map.
</p>
<p>
	"haha yeah" demi giggled. "That one chair still had the petrified face of that one foodie etched into it. 'AAAAAhhh" Demi contorted her face trying to make her self look like a chair with a face and laughed. "AH the circle of life" she said with a sigh.
</p>
<p>
	Buffcat was not packing up his axe and broadsword. He made biscuits on Squib to wake up but it was no use. Squib was useless in the morning. And in the afternoon. And pretty much at any point in time that was or will ever exist.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla pointed at the map. "There!" she said pointing to a small dot. "Catsopolis' B and B and B" She read aloud. "The third B stands for 'Brew" she continued.
</p>
<p>
	"MEW MEW MEOW?" Buffcat chirped. 
</p>
<p>
	"Maybe!" Ugla replied. "But it could just be a name. I haven't seen another cat man around these parts since...."
</p>
<p>
	Buffcat lowered his head sadly causing Ugla to catch herself. "Anyway if I know my B's that second B should mean breakfast. Maybe I'll get some terrorbird eggs with enema sauce" She licked her lips as all of their stomachs growled. Buffcat was tying a rope around Squib and preparing to drag him the all the way to the town.
</p>
<p>
	"We're not going to GRAAL?" Squib said finally waking up. As he stood the rope dangled from his neck loosely.
</p>
<p>
	"We're going to a fancy Triple B!" Demi said excitedly not really knowing what that was.
</p>
<p>
	"This is like...the 5th episode we DID NOT make it to Graal. We've been traveling for like 20 episodes now. Something tells me you're avoiding going back and seeing your ex boyfriend" Squib said stingingly.
</p>
<p>
	"No....NO!" Ugla shot back. "And he's not my ex boyfriend....he's my...."
</p>
<p>
	"Mew!" Buffcat chimed in.
</p>
<p>
	"Exactly thank you BC. And besides...A wizard never avoids anything. She procrastinates precisely when needed." 
</p>
<p>
	"And I told you I DON'T NEED MY TODDLER LEASH ANYMORE I'M A BIG BOY NOW!" Squib yelled as he tossed the rope to the ground and stomped on it.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" Buffcat agreed and then folded up a chair that had once been a foodie. 
</p>
<p>
	"OH GOD DON'T FOLD ME I'M NOT A FOLDING CHAIR NOW AAAAAHHHHHH JESUS ORCRIST FUCK" he would scream to nobody but himself. The horror of being trapped as a chair surpassed only by the horrors of being alone with his own thoughts for eternity or until someone has an estate sale and sells him to a trash man or those college kids who doing moving in the summer for extra cash.
</p>
<p>
	"AND here we are! The village of Fame Inn." Ugla said after hours of boring walking and no exposition. She looked at the map and lowered it to take in the quirkiness of the village. But when she did she saw a practical ghost town and coincidentally a fog horn went off.
</p>
<p>
	"ooooooo aaaaahhhh" Demi said in wonder. "I love all the gray and sadness!"
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" Buffcat said looking at the map.
</p>
<p>
	"What kind of name is Fame Inn?" Squib nosed his way into the map. 
</p>
<p>
	"UGLA!" Squib shouted. "This says FAMINE not Fame Inn! This town is marked as being under a famine! Great. Grand. Wonderful. Squib is the voice of reason and literacy. We're doomed. We're fucked. We're DOOMFUCKED" Squib said pacing back and forth.
</p>
<p>
	"Wait look over there!" Demi pointed through the fog of depression at an inn that was lit up and glowing, lively as the day it opened. "That must be the Killer B's tavern!"
</p>
<p>
	"YESSSSSSS COME ONE COME ALL" a giant megaphone in the shape of a man's head turned to face the travelers. "WELCOME TO CATSOPOLIS'S B AND B AND B. ENTER AT YOUR OWN PERIL FOR YOUR HUNGER MAY BE SLAYED"
</p>
<p>
	"Wow" Ugla said impressed at this blatent display of capitalist insensitivity.
</p>
<p>
	"Does it say other things or does it just repea..." Demi was cut off.
</p>
<p>
	"YESSSSS COME ONE COME ALLLL WELCOME TO CATSOPOLIS'S"
</p>
<p>
	"Ok I already hate that lets go in" Ugla cut off the talking mega head.
</p>
<p>
	As they stepped into the Triple B the waft of breakfast hit their nostrils like a waft of my jizz hit yo sweet mama's face last night. The smell of exotic spices and cooking meats tugged at their nostrils like a stink hand from an unwatched windowsil pie.
</p>
<p>
	"Whooooooaaaa" Demi, Squib and Buffcat said in unicen except Buffcat said 'Mew'.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla closed her eyes and tried to identify every delicous smell. This was what they needed. A good hot home cooked mean and....COFFEE!~?~~?~?
</p>
<p>
	She smelled it clear as day like in that commercial where the brother comes home for Christmas to fuck his little sister. I think she gets stuck in the coffee machine or something I don't remember.
</p>
<p>
	"HELLO AND WELCOME! I am Burgundy Catsopolis owner and care taker of this establishment. May I start you off with some....coffee?" looking directly into Ugla's eyes when saying it.'
</p>
<p>
	"YES DEAR GODS YES" Ugla shouted.
</p>
<p>
	"I'll have what she's having..." A KObold sitting with is wife said in the corner.
</p>
<p>
	Burgundy Catsopolis was no cat man. He was just a normal human man who was balding and wore an apron. Clearly he had managed to keep his business alive when the rest of the town was flaily and well...dying.
</p>
<p>
	"COMING RIGHT UP" He said and then spun around with a flourish.
</p>
<p>
	The gang sat in silence taking in all the tavern had to offer. Comforts that they had missed being out on the road sleeping under the stars. All around were mounted heads of animals that had presumably been hunted for the tavern's food.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew mew..." Buffcat said uncomfortably.
</p>
<p>
	"OHhh its its ok Big Kitty" Demi said petting him. "I'm sure they only have regular non sentient living beings...." Demi was cut short at the sight of an Orc's head mounted above a doorway. Under the head was a plaque that read "Zark the Beheader" and then below that "Ole Irony-sides".
</p>
<p>
	"5 house special coffee's for my new favorite customers!" Burgundy interupted. The coffee cups clanged and tinged gently against each other as he carried them.
</p>
<p>
	"But there's only four of us" Squib said.
</p>
<p>
	"Well I'm sure your little gelatanous friend wouldn't mind some of our finest morning brew!" He said as he placed down a tiny almost doll sized cup for Jelly and placed a tiny skeleton key as a stirrer into it.
</p>
<p>
	"Awwww Jelly you're a real customer now" Demi said taking him out of her pack and hugging him.
</p>
<p>
	They each took a long sniff of the coffee and sighed in almost sheer orgasmic pleasure. They blew on the steam to cool off the brown liquid much as I suspect Rich blowns on his various brown liquids he consumes for sustinece at every meal, ingestible or otherwise. Still trying to get MEAT BROWN or whatever that restuarant was called for a sponsor. Sponsor us MEAT BROWN!
</p>
<p>
	As they took their first sip sips of coffee they were transported to hot brown heaven. Not to be confused with the porn site of the same name. Lots of sisters getting stuck inside coffee machines on that site. 
</p>
<p>
	"Oh sweet mother of milky mammories!" Squib said as his leg shook like a dogs.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew mew mew mew mewmewmemwmew" Buffcat set his cup down daintily and began to purr.
</p>
<p>
	"I'd suck this coffee out of a dead dogmans dick vein. That is one find cup of coffee" Ugla said toasting to Burgundy.
</p>
<p>
	"It's aight" Demi said smooshing up her face in dissaproval.
</p>
<p>
	The entire tavern gasped.
</p>
<p>
	"What!? I said it was aight!" Demi looked around nervously. "Its a lot of caffiene. I'm more of a tea girl. Tea and this neon green sewer jello we used to gather from the scum collectors called 'Mountain Dew'. That stuff was delicious."
</p>
<p>
	"Well may I suggest you weary adventurers stay the night? We have many rooms available. We have a room with a giant heart shaped tub for the young couple" Burgundy looked at Ugla and Squib.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh fuck me don't I just ate" Ugla wretched.
</p>
<p>
	"With those lack of horns no thank you" Squib frowned.
</p>
<p>
	"No thanks we'll just pay and be on our way we have a hot date with the big city" Ugla said throwing some coinage onto the wooden table.
</p>
<p>
	"Are you sure.....it's already evening...." Burgundy pointed out of the nearest window and indeed it was evening.
</p>
<p>
	"What...but...." Ugla shook her head and rubbed it. "We must be in need of rest. We have been traveling a long time."
</p>
<p>
	"Goood gooooood" Burgundy said rubbing his hands together. "Now off to beddy bye you go. If you need a nightcap just all see ball us by pressing pound, asterix, devil horns, 69, weed leaf, 2 planes crashing into the twin towers emoji's."
</p>
<p>
	"Yes....yes good that's...ok" Ugla started to wobble as she and the others made their way upstairs. Above them the head of a Titbear (tit like the bird) gazed down on them lifelessly until they passed. Then its eyes moved to peer down at them. No one noticed.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm not tired at all I had all that coffee" Demi tugged at Burgundy's apron. "hey do you wanna know what happens in the future do ya I can tell you when you're gonna die probably did you kill all of these animals or did you buy them at a yard sale I bet their hard to dust they look dusty you should dust them I use pledge but I don't think you have that yet maybe use some kind of magic dust spell or make all the brooms and stuff come alive and do all the dusting fo ryou like in that movie...."
</p>
<p>
	"SILENCE ANNOYING CHILD" Burgundy snapped. "Ahem sorry sorry. If you aren't tired may I suggest you help out BY WASHING DISHES!" 
</p>
<p>
	Upstairs Ugla put on her nightgown robes and slid into the warm sheets of the bed. She yawned again. She was more tired than she had ever been. How had they gotten here again? Weren't they....weren't they doing...something.....?
</p>
<p>
	She shot up. "No...this isn't right". She went to the window and flung the curtains back. Outside she could see time pass at many hundreds of precent faster. Like that scene at the end of Gangs of New York but not stupid. What was the point of that anyway? Like 'OH MAN GANGS EXISTED DURING THE CIVIL WAR IN NEW YORK ISN"T THAT CRAZY!?" No it isn't. And nobody gives a fuck about New York. Stop foddling its balls Scorsese. We get it. You're from NEW YORK.  At least it wasn't a rat sitting on a railing that ended that movie. HOW IS THAT EVEN SYMBOLISM.THE RAT DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A GUN!
</p>
<p>
	Ugla drew the curtains back and started to wobble again. "I have to.....find.....Buffcat....and....sleep......must......bed" She stumbled and fell onto the bed facelpanting into the covers.
</p>
<p>
	Sandle's zooped into cat form and meowed pawing at her face but to no avail. "Mew" Sandle's cried and then just laid down on Ugla's head.
</p>
<p>
	"This stinks FART HOLES!" Demi said as she was on her 5th load of dishes. "Wish I could make all the brooms come alive and do the dishes and then shove it up that guys b hole so far he gets splinters in his throat..." She said under her breath angrily washing a bowl.
</p>
<p>
	"meeeewwwww" a ghostly mew cried on the wind.
</p>
<p>
	"BC? Did you come down here for more hot brown?" Demi said over her shoulder. She turned to look but...nothing. With a shrug she went back to washing the bowls.
</p>
<p>
	"mmmmmmmmmmmmeeeewwwwwwww'' again another cat cry from on the wind. Demi stopped what she was doing now. She had seen enough scooby doo episodes to know that something spooky was afoot. She squinted her eyes and tried to listen with every part of her body.
</p>
<p>
	"Meeeewwwww" the cry again shot through her like a cold shower.
</p>
<p>
	She dropped the bowl into the bucket and made her way over to a wall. 
</p>
<p>
	"It's coming from inside this wall....I'LL SAVE YOU WALL KITTY" Demi said whiping her hands off on her apron. She reached back to unsheath her flame sword and smash through the wall but then though about what Ugla had taught her. 'Don't go smashing through walls because insurance doesn't always pay for it. Remember: If there's a candle stick...that will surely open it" she said robotically.
</p>
<p>
	On the side of the wall was indeed a candle stick. When Demi turned it the wall gave way to a set of stone stairs which led down into a basement.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm coming for you Basement KItty" Demi said unsheathing her sword for reals this time.
</p>
<p>
	Upstairs Buffcat woke with a start. He too had heard the mews of sadness. With everthing he had he fought to wake up, his cat nature fighting him at ever turn. He managed to make his way to the doorway leading out to the hallway but when he tried to turn the handle it was locked from teh outside.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew mew mew" he said. Then sick of this shit, he simply balled up his giant fist and smashed through the door. 
</p>
<p>
	"OI THAT CAT MAN IS TRYNNA ESCAPE" said a Kobold as he held out a spear. Buffcat grinned a toothy grin. The sound of dozens of kobolds running up wooden stairs echoes through the long hallway. 
</p>
<p>
	"Mew mewmewmewmew" Buffcat said with a smile. 
</p>
<p>
	Back down in the basement Demi could hardly see. 
</p>
<p>
	"If only I had a flame of some kind...ohh duh stupid me" She said igniting her flame sword. It's glow lit up a room of horrors. All around were stuffed Cat Men with various tubes and liquids being either pumped into or out of their bodies.
</p>
<p>
	"MEW" Buffcat's battle cry roared through the tavern. The kobolds charged. Buffcat swung his axe downward cutting a kobold intwain. 
</p>
<p>
	"2 days until retirement..." The kobold whined as his two half split apart revealing every organ and artery like in a science book.
</p>
<p>
	Another kobold threw his spear and it landed nearly missing Buffcat's ear. He hissed with rage, pried the spear from the wall and used it like a toothpick at a cocktail party scewering 5 kobolds at once. He then bend the spear with his huge muscles into a circle so that the kobolds would run into each other have to work as a team to move. They learned the true meaning of teamwork that day, until they each died slow horrible painful deaths by blood loss.
</p>
<p>
	Buffcat then used a dead kobold like as a hammer and recreated the hallway hammer scene from Oldboy. The good one. Not the one starring Thanos where he doesn't fuck his own daughter. Lots of that going on lately. ANYWAY!
</p>
<p>
	Slow Clap 
</p>
<p>
	"Veeeerrrrry good little trouble maker" said a voice in the darkness. Demi pointed her sword toward the sound and saw Burgundy Catsopolis standing in full evil warlock regalia.
</p>
<p>
	"YOU!" She shouted. "I should have known anyone who could make coffee that good would be evil!"
</p>
<p>
	Burgundy chuckled. "But that is the whole point my dear" Burgundy ran a thin long finger down a tube into one of the Cat Men's mouth. "You saw this town...its dead. Fresh for the taking!"
</p>
<p>
	"And you're some....Evil Magic Guy?" Demi shouted trying to sound tough.
</p>
<p>
	"I AM A WARLOCK CHILD AND THIS IS NO TAVERN!" With a snap and an explosion of power the walls of the tavern inside and out gave way and fell down like a movie set. Outside the tavern's exterior was replaced by the cold stone of a tower. An EVIL TOWER! The sign for the tavern was replaced with a new sign. AN EVIL SIGN. And on that evil sign read the words "EVIL TOWER"!
</p>
<p>
	"But...." Demi frowned. "Why even go to all this trouble to make this place look like a tavern? I mean the town looks depressing enough. An evil tower would fit right in really if you think about it"
</p>
<p>
	"I WAS A THEATRE MAJOR AND I'LL BE GODS DAMNED IF I DON'T USE MY DEGREE" Burgundy screamed in a rage.
</p>
<p>
	"Theatre major....the most evil of college majors..." Demi said prepared for a fight. Now she knew what kind of scum she was dealing with. What kind of attention seeking degenerate she would have to take down. What kind of evil manipulative over the top sick sing songy absolute embarrassment of a dork fetishist she would have to kill with cold hard steel and flame.
</p>
<p>
	"And you drugged the coffee..." Demi surmised.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh no my dear that was all on the level. See...my true passion in life is coffee. I love it so much I never shut up about it. And like all sad fucks I use this one thing to define my personality. Coffee and musical theatre. Really those two things...."
</p>
<p>
	Just then Buffcat burst down the stairs along with Ugla. Still groggy Ugla held up Sandle's the Catana. 
</p>
<p>
	"Stop right there Fred Asshair!" She said with a laugh then dropped the sword down and snored for a second before waking back up and holding the sword up again.
</p>
<p>
	"Ah good my favorite customers are here" Burgundy said tauntingly.
</p>
<p>
	At the sight of the Cat Men Buffcat was sent into a rage. He roared a deep meow.
</p>
<p>
	"These are my greatest achievement Mr. Cat Man. And if it weren't for this medling kid you'd be a part of my great plan. A plan to bring delicious coffee to the world. A WORLD WHERE I RULE AS EVIL WARLOCK COFFEE KING!" Burgundy laughed so hard he started coughing.
</p>
<p>
	"You know where the best coffee in Daranos comes from don't you? It comes from the excrement of cats. They eat these special coffee beans and then poop them out of their butts and then I take the seeds in the poop and make delicous coffee! Not even a wizard could withstand its effects!" he laughed again.
</p>
<p>
	"We drank SHIT COFFEE!?!?" Demi screamed and began to rub her tongue.
</p>
<p>
	"HOT BROWN hehe" Ugla said with a laugh still groggy from sleep.
</p>
<p>
	"These Cat Men aren't dead....they're my....helpers in this alchemical venture I have created." Burgundy exposited.
</p>
<p>
	"You're hte most evil coffee man on earth" Demi said shaking her head. "You're even worse than Starfucks!"
</p>
<p>
	"EW UNIONS" Burgundy winced. "But now you must sleeeeep...sleeeeeeeeeeep little ones" Burgundy commanded as a wave of sleepiness washed over the three. Demi struggled too to remain awake. She turned to Buffcat and Ugla, who was now sleeping standing up leaning on her staff.
</p>
<p>
	"Toss....meeee" She said to Buffcat. "Toss me BASEMENT KITTY!"
</p>
<p>
	Buffcat realizing what she was getting at grabbed Demi and swung her around merry go round style and then hammer tossed her headfirst toward a giant vat of butt water being siphoned from the captured cat men.
</p>
<p>
	Demi unsheathed her sword and shouted her most defiant battle cry. With a clang she plunged her flame sword into the metal vat. The flame super heated the poop juice almost instantly.
</p>
<p>
	"How about we top you off a bit there" Demi said smiling. She pulled the sword from the vat and with a loud explosion and HISS steaming brown breakfast butt water shot out and covered the Warlock in hot shitty brown scalding wake up liquid.
</p>
<p>
	"AHHHHHHH NO MY COFFEE" he shouted as his skin began to sag off of his bones. Burgundy went to take a step toward the vat but his leg broke off form his lower leg as the poopy soup melted through his bones. His concentration broken, the Cat men and all of the stuffed animal heads in the once tavern room began to reawaken. Buffcat rushed over to free as many as he could of their poop tubes and bean IVs.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla, finally snapping out of her stupor, woke up leaning against her staff. 
</p>
<p>
	"What'd I miss?" She said looking around confused.
</p>
<p>
	"I'll KILL YOU FOR THIS LITTLE TROUBLE MAKER! I'LL TAP DANCE ON YOUR GRAVE. I'LL BUILD A SET AND WRITE AN OFF BROADWAY PLAY ABOUT HOW MY DAD NEVER LOVED ME AND HOW IT WAS ALL YOUR FAULT" Burgundy screamed. As the flesh melted from around his eyes the only thing that remained was the skeleton that was once Burgundy Catsopolis.
</p>
<p>
	"MEW MEW MEW" Buffcat said running over to Demi.
</p>
<p>
	"We did it Kitty Kat Man!" Demi said hugging him.
</p>
<p>
	"What should we do about that?" Demi asked Ugla
</p>
<p>
	"Oh I dont think he's going to hurt anyone anymore..." Ugla said patting Burgundy's skeleton.
</p>
<p>
	"You're right! I'm finally A STAR! A DANCING STAR!" Burgundy Skeleman did a tap dance with a top hat and cane that he somehow had acquired as he tapped off into the sunset.
</p>
<p>
	After cleaning up the town. The Cat Men settled down with the villagers and helped them start over. Buffcat was releived that he finally got to see more of his kind, few they may be. Plus the town had a new tavern free of poop coffee. The Evil Tower. Every Turdsday night was ladies night and if you could stand listening to Burgundy Skeleman's tap routine for more than 15 minutes your meal was free!
</p>
<p>
	Nobody would ever win that free meal.
</p>
<p>
	FIN
</p>
