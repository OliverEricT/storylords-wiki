<p>
	The Pain Mines
</p>
<p>
	Duncan - Human Leader
</p>
<p>
	Gunk - Dwarf 
</p>
<p>
	Chic Pea - Gnome
</p>
<p>
	Peppercorn - Gnome
</p>
<p>
	Fred - INSANE
</p>
<p>
		"Hit me" Gunk said gruffly as he tossed a handful of sexy silver onto the table.
</p>
<p>
	"Going for the Full Stable, I see" Peppercorn said tossing another card down. It was the 6 of Milkers. No help for Gunk.
</p>
<p>
	"Again" Gunk said while swilling a flagon of Honey Hop. The suds running down his glorious man beard like the sweat drip down my bawls this time drawing the Prince of Nudes.
</p>
<p>
	"Aaaand you Nutted" Peppercorn said smiling as he used his tiny gnome arms to gather up the loot. "I guess Ebony Quiznaks isn't your game. That's ok you can always go back to rolling bones in the back allys fo Graal and paying off your debts with those splendid DSL's (Dwarf Suckling Lips)."
</p>
<p>
	"HEY! I'll have you konw that was the best time of my life AND FURTHERMORE do you really think my lips are looking good? I've been doing Lip Flexes" Gunk said as he made a smoochy face at Peppercorn.
</p>
<p>
	"WORK IT GIRLL" Peppercorn said toasting his friend.
</p>
<p>
	The hideout door opened and in walked Duncan.
</p>
<p>
	"Hi, Welcome back. Please use your theif union signet ring to upgrade to Safe House Plus!" A magical image said from a nearby table.
</p>
<p>
	"OH MY GOD SHUT THE FUCKING FUCK UP YOU FUCK" Yelled Fred as he threw an axe at the table, hitting it directly. The image fizzled and stuttered. 
</p>
<p>
	"I---I Only reget---never...h-hahving h-had....s-sssssex" the image said as it disappeared hopefully forever but probably not.
</p>
<p>
	"Alright guys I just got a message from Joey" Duncan said sitting down on the couch next to Fred. Chic Pea walked in from the kitchen area stirring a mixing bowl and wearing an adorably sized chef hat.
</p>
<p>
	"Joey's got a jobbo for us?" She said tasting the badder.
</p>
<p>
	"FINALLY" Gunk said still doing lip flexes. "iBall us the deets" 
</p>
<p>
	"Haven't you heard" Peppercorn said snarkily. "Duncan switch over to the new Automadroid"
</p>
<p>
	"Oh is that why my missages are showing up green on my iBall?"
</p>
<p>
	Slowly a little Dwarven rolled into the room on his little droid metalic ball. It popped open a panel where a small glass ball was revealed. Behind the ball was a gem of some kind. Slowly the glass ball filled with a blue haze and the gem began to glow a bright white light. The gem, acting as a projector, shown the haze in the middle of the room Scooby Doo style while a hazing form began to fade into view.
</p>
<p>
	"OH MY FUCKING GOD ANY FUCKING DAY NOW" Fred said laying on the couch with a doob in his mouth and trucker hat lowered over his eyes that said "It's BRISCUIT BIIITCH". It was one of his prized posessions having won it at Briscon 6969 for defeating famed steak champion Fats Mignon in a bare knuckle drag out steak eating competitions that lasted 3 straight days. It was said that Fats ate so much red meat that he was litteraly immune to ass cancer. Kind of like a person who injects themselves with snake venom everyday to build up an immunity. DO NOT DO either of those things because you'll die so fast it'll make your mama say "BOYS your daddy died from being a fuckin idiot again and this time he's not coming back so meet your new daddy, a guy who sexually pleases me but who you will have a tenuous relationship with for the rest of your life."
</p>
<p>
	ANNNNYWAY.
</p>
<p>
	"HELLO" the hologram I mean MAGICAL IMAGE said. "Is dis thing on? Hello? Why da hell is this image all green..."
</p>
<p>
	"Joey it's us we're here" Duncan said kicking the automodroid clearing up the image.
</p>
<p>
	"Ok whatever listen up ya mooks. I gotta job for yas. Toins out a Lord Crumbus of the Finger Guns Crew needs help finding his wife. She went to Spermuda with her friends and has been missing ever since. Crumbus suspects the Golden Shadow are responsible since they are straight up dickwads and would totally do some shit like this."
</p>
<p>
	"Sounds plausible" Gunk said drinking more Honey Hop and burping the whole Daranosian AND Dwarvish alphebet in one long epic belch.
</p>
<p>
	2 minutes later. "Anyway" Joey conintued. "We're gonna have to use stealth for this one if the Golden Shadow is involved."
</p>
<p>
	"ummm yeah totally like cool cool but like....whats the catch" Chic Pea said still stirring her badder.
</p>
<p>
	Joey sighed. "Well...yous not gonna like this but...." he paused for dramatic effect. "The Golden Shadow's hideout is deep within the Pain Mines." Joey paused waiting for the innevitable GASP. But the room fell silent as Fred coughed up some dub smoke.
</p>
<p>
	"ANYWAY" Joey continued. "Find the wife get the coin. Easy peasy jerk off and squeezy"
</p>
<p>
	"This is really gonna cut into like...my 'bake sale'. I'm cooking files and crowbars into cakes and donating them to prisons. ACAB"
</p>
<p>
	"A noble cause there goily" Joey replied.
</p>
<p>
	"Ok" Duncan interjected. "Chic can you portal us to Lord Crumbus. I expect we need some more info"
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah like how hot his wife is" Joey said weirdly like he was part of the crew.
</p>
<p>
	Fred coughed another awkward cough.
</p>
<p>
	CUT TO
</p>
<p>
	Inside Lord Crumbus' castle it was a complete and total fuck fest. 
</p>
<p>
	"This guys married?" Gunk questioned while getting a little too close to the splash zone of the orgy that was going on in the hallway leading to the throne room. You KNOW when an orgy spills out into the hallway that its a fuckin BANGER.
</p>
<p>
	"Married to the mob lyfe 420 blaze it is more like it" Peppercorn said as he stepped over a couple of Pixies just sloggin each other's hogs.
</p>
<p>
	The throne room doors were huge. Like a pair of huge tits on a room if a room could have tits which if you ask me they all should. The creaked open slowly to reveal a gigantic room filled with food and fuckery. 
</p>
<p>
	"I would like...avoid eating ANY of this food" Chic Pea said frowning. It was like Tuesday Night Shrimp night at the Tiddy Twister in this place which basically meant even touching any of this food would give you super crabs that would take up residence all the way up to your eyebrows.
</p>
<p>
	The food did smell delicious though. There was hot meats just melting off the bone but anyway lets talk about the food. HEY OH! Soups were in cauldrons so large that a gnome could use them as a tiny house. The stews and soups smelled of spices from all over the realm. Even Dilbian cuisine was on the menu although nobody could smell it because the Dilbians are terrible cooks. Just hot bread with salt on it IF YOURE LUCKY! Those Beach Humpers don't know how to do shit. Fuckin Dilb.
</p>
<p>
	As the crew walked past the buffet the sounds of orgy moaning was cacauphanous. 
</p>
<p>
	"YES! FREE ME FROM THE CHAINS OF MY CUMLESS LIFE" a troll witch yelled. She must have been like 400 years old but hey old witches deserve love too. 'The More Sexperience the more I clear my nuts' is what I always say. A dogman was straight up just suckin on a raw bone while getting his raw bone straight up sucked upon. He let out a howl and it wasn't even a full moon if you know what I mean. Dude cummed.
</p>
<p>
	On a humoungus throne sat the ogre diamyo Crumbus. He was easily 12 feet 12" inches tall. In his left hand was a septer of pure crystal. In his right hand he was eating an entire person like he was about to watch the UFC fights at a Buffalo Wild Wings. Dude's whole personaliltly was on full display.
</p>
<p>
	"AH my dear contractors of whome I will send you a W2 later in the quarter" Crumb said like he was taking business classes Daranos Community College. He didn't have the magical acument to get into Wizard Yale.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm so glad you...came!" he said gesturing around to the orgy that seriously nobody could miss. Like you could be Hellen Keller and still know what was going on in here just from the stankonia alone.
</p>
<p>
	"We were told you have some info for us" Duncan said squinting slightly at how bad that last joke was. I mean who wrote that for that guy?
</p>
<p>
	"AH straight to business my boy good good. The Pain Mines are going to be quite the challenge" Crumbus said licking his sick lips. "You'll need disguises as to not draw too much attention" He snapped his fingers and 3 attendents shuffled out of the back with golden ninja guis. 
</p>
<p>
	"Wait..." Peppercorn said. "These guys are ninjas?"
</p>
<p>
	"Yes" Crumb nodded
</p>
<p>
	"And they wear golden armor? I mean how is that even close to being inconspicuous? How the hell are you NOT gonna be seen in those things?" Pepper began to rant.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah and like...Golden Shadow? How can a shadow be gold? A golden shadow would be the opposite of like...a shadow. Should have called themselves the Ninja Nightlights or like Brite Spotlight Crew or something I dont know we'll workshop it." Chic Pea said agreeing with her brother.
</p>
<p>
	"What can I say" Crumbus snorted. "These guys really love gold. Like REALLY love gold if you catch my meaning"
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah we got it" Duncan said
</p>
<p>
	"They give new meaning to the term White Gold if you catch my drift" Crumbus continued and shot Duncan the finger guns.
</p>
<p>
	"YEAH WE GOT IT" 
</p>
<p>
	"These will help you be unseen I dont know what to tell you they didn't really think this through too good" Crumbus said snapping his fingers again dismissing the atendees. "There are only 3 of them so only three of you can go into the mines"
</p>
<p>
	Duncan interjected "Pep and Gunk you're on guys in the van duty"
</p>
<p>
	"AHHHH not again" Gunk said dissappointedly. "I wanted to bust some pain nuts"
</p>
<p>
	"You can be the getaway driver" Peppercorn said reassuring him. Besides we dont usually get paired together and ratings show people love it when opposite personalities are paired up. Its sweeps baby"
</p>
<p>
	"What van?" Fred questioned while chomping on a sex steak.
</p>
<p>
	Outisde Chic Pea opened a plot portal to reveal the crews #1 hot ride getaway whip. A bone van with a sexy pinup wizard painting on the side. She was topless and had huge bolt ons with a spliff the size of Other Jeff's dick between them suggestively. In wizard runes the words "Smoke Em if you Got Em" was written over this masterpiece. The suggestion being not to smoke if you have the weed but if you have huge bolt on hanger banger tids. It was a euphemism that only the greatest philosophers could get on first viewing.
</p>
<p>
	"There she is" Peppercorn said proudly. "The Bone Wagon herself"
</p>
<p>
	"SHOT BOW" yelled Fred.
</p>
<p>
	Soon the Bone Wagon pulled up near a gaping casm, the site of the famed PAIN MINES. Chic Pea used a cloaking spell to hide the wagon from sight. Duncan, Fred, and Chic Pea all suited up in the Golden Gui disguises. Obvioiusly Chic Pea's did not fit since it was not made for a gnome. 
</p>
<p>
	"No probs" she said confidently as she waved her hands around making runes in the air. Suddenly the outfit shrank and fit perfectly to her tiny but sensuous gnome body. A bespoke ninja fashion that was sure to be all the rage next season.
</p>
<p>
	Fred's outfit also did not fit but in the opposite direction. It was tight around the well...everywhere.
</p>
<p>
	"No probs" he said mocking Chic Pea's voice. He flexed his panty moistening muscles and ripped through the arm and leg holes. WIth a switch motion he ripped the abs area completely free of the gui revealing his sick glistening 1000 sit ups a day stomach muscles. They were as golden as freshly baked garlic knots fresh out of the oven. THE PAIN OVEN!
</p>
<p>
	"Alright masks on" Duncan commanded. The two others put their ninja hoods on and made their way to the entrance of the mines.
</p>
<p>
	"Bring me back someone's spine" Gunk yelled out the door. "STupid van duty stupid Peppercorn on his stupid all see ballputer....". Peppercorn sat at his all see ballputer station and began to possess the Pain Mines all see ball with a magical algorythm so he could see through the mine's own all see ball's.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm in" Pep said smiling.
</p>
<p>
	At the front gate of the cave the three heros walked slowlly toward the guard booth. 
</p>
<p>
	"HALT IDIOTS" said a guard dressed in pain mines guard garb. Just straight up S&M gear, ball gag dangling around his neck.
</p>
<p>
	"We're uh..." Duncan stumbled over his words.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah yeah I know who you are" The guard interupted. "We've been getting a ton of oyou guys lately. Just need to sign in"
</p>
<p>
	"Oh ok" duncan said confusingly looking for a quil and parchment to sign in. The guard, however, turned around to reveal his assless chaps and on his left ass cheek a sign in form.
</p>
<p>
	"Use the paddle" he said sexily. Duncan grabbed an ink paddle sitting on the booth and slapped the guards totally innocent butt. He sure did hate it. 
</p>
<p>
	"Oh no I don't think you got all of it...guess we better try again" The guard said wiggling his butt.
</p>
<p>
	"Let me try" Fred said grabbing the paddle. He wound up and swung for the fences like this was the first day of summer in Dazed and Confused. The impact was sait to have been heard over 30 miles away as the paddle wood connected with ass meat creating a sonic boom. The guards eardrums immediaitely ruptured and blood spilled out of his brain holes at an alarming rate. Like way faster than blood should come out of any part of anyone's body.
</p>
<p>
	Hundreds of miles away a murkmonk was sitting on his front porch waiting for discretely packaged boner pills to show up when he heard a thunderous boom crackle across the sky. Putting down his crocheting he leaned over the railing and squinted his eyes miserly.
</p>
<p>
	"HEY!" he shouted. "IF ALL THAT ASS CLAPPIN BREAKS A WINDOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL YOUR PARENT'S INSURANCE COMPANY AND YOUR DEDUCTABLE WILL GO UP SO HIGH THAT THEY WON'T EVENN BE ABLE TO SEND YOU TO DARANOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND YOU'LL HAVE TO SUCK DICK IN THE BACK ALLYS OF GRAAL JUST TO EAT FOR THE DAY. YOU'LL BE AS HUNGRY AS YOU ARE ASHAMED USE YOUR INSIDE ASS SLAPPING VOICES PLEASE"
</p>
<p>
	Needless to say the guard was super dead. 
</p>
<p>
	"Looks like everything is in order" Fred said stepping over the pool of brain blood that had terrifying pooled outside of the booth.
</p>
<p>
	Insde the mines the crew saw horros that no gnome, elf, man, dogman, catman, Centaur, or Pixie should have to see. Against the walls were chained thousands of souls from every corner of Daranos. Pain Guards strapped in leather and chains were whipping the shit out of them as the inmates futilely hacked against the walls with pick axes.
</p>
<p>
	"What are they digging for" Fred asked
</p>
<p>
	"They aren't" Chic Pea said. "The pain is what they are really mining here. Look" She said pointing to an inmate just getting his shit rocked with a cat of nine tales. As he screamed a blue vapor rose from out of his mouth hole. It slowly rose to the cave cieling where it was then sucked up by an organic proboscus looking meat flower. It looked very vaginal and very intimidating.
</p>
<p>
	"Where the fuck does that go I wonder" Duncan said grimmacing.
</p>
<p>
	"Nobody knows" Chic Pea said as they walked past the inmate who was kneelilng down and panting. He was sheet white sweating.
</p>
<p>
	"GET UP KUR THESE WALLS AREN'T GONNA PICK AXE THEMSELVES" the guard said while rubbing his nipple for some reason. As the crew wandered lower into the mine they found an elevetor or LIFT if you're british and say weird shit. They stepped on and hit the down button. As they decended into what seemed like Hell itself the wails and screams became almost unbearable. The lower they went the more absurd the torture. On one level centaurs were being whipped while a guard dangled a carrot on a fishing line in front of their faces.
</p>
<p>
	"I DONT EVEN LIKE CARROTS" Said one centaur. "THE TOP HALF OF ME IS A MAN I LIKE FRITATAS!" The guards kept on pounding that horses ass.
</p>
<p>
	Soon the crew reached a level with a golden skull logo.
</p>
<p>
	"This must be it" Duncan said. "Lets find this lady and the the fuck out of this place"
</p>
<p>
	They ninja'd their way into a cooridoor and before them lay a massive golden door. Fred bit into the door. 
</p>
<p>
	"Yup...pure gold" he said chewing the gold and swallowing it.
</p>
<p>
	As he did the door began to creak and wretch. The sound of mechanical movement was deafening as the large doorway opened to reveal another throne room.
</p>
<p>
	"WHat is it with these people and throne rooms...like....we get it you like sitting on big chairs" Chic Pea said scoffing.
</p>
<p>
	"WELCOME" Said a booming voice. The crew squinted to see who or what was welcoming them. The shine of gold glistening everywhere in the room. As their eyes adjusted they saw they were in a treasure vault. All around them were gold chests and rubies and diamons and gems that didnt even have names yet like Cummodite a gem that when touched immediately makes you jizz your pants and Pissthril a metal that well you get it. They even saw a treasure chest full of golden fleshlights. 
</p>
<p>
	"Damn these guy DO love gold" Duncan said snagging a fleshlight for uh...research.
</p>
<p>
	"Go on" the voice said soothingly. It was a woman's voice. Pure and calm. "Take as much as you'd like. We have plenty and we can always make more" the voice finished.
</p>
<p>
	"Who are you??" Demanded Fred.
</p>
<p>
	Out from the shadows crept a human female wearing a dark crown clad in all black. 
</p>
<p>
	"I am Axewound" she said.
</p>
<p>
	"No...." Fred said.
</p>
<p>
	"That name is like...really unfortunate" Chic Pea said curling an eyebrow.
</p>
<p>
	"We're looking for Lady Crumbus" Duncan said. "I'd offer you a bribe but like...this place is stank full of gold so if you tell us where she is we wont' have to burry that pretty face into the dirt."
</p>
<p>
	Axewound cackled with laughter. "You won't HAVE to?" She questioned as she held up a single finger and shot a bolt of dark power at Duncan. It pierced his right shoulder knocking him the ground.
</p>
<p>
	Immediately Chic Pea conjured a protective shield around them but it was too late. Duncan lay on the ground unconcious and bleeding. As blood poured from the wound it drained towards Axewound. As it reached her she raised her arms and absorbed the blood into her very being. She moaned like it was an orgasm and licked her extended finger in delight.
</p>
<p>
	"Who's next" she said doing the eeny meany miny mo point.
</p>
<p>
	Fred stepped out of the shield, electric energy crackling around his god like muscles as he exited the energy field.
</p>
<p>
	"I remember you" he said.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm flattered" She said as she pointed her finger and shot a bolt at Fred. Fred did not budge. Instead he used his man hands to grab the bolt out of hte air and hold it in place like the only good part in Force Awakens when Kylo holds that blaster bolt in place for like 5 fuckin minutes. Clenching his teeth in pain he gripped the bolt tighter and tighter until its power diminished.
</p>
<p>
	"What do you bench like 6000 stone?" Axewound queried. "No matter I bore of this boring tedious super boring conversation." Suddenly the walls began to creak a distinctive sound of skittering rose in decibels every few seconds.
</p>
<p>
	Chic Pea ran over to Duncan and sealed his wound with a cauterize spell which was really just a fire spell but it sounded more medical this way.
</p>
<p>
	Back at the van Peppercorn scanned each all see ball view.
</p>
<p>
	"I've lost them" he said. Gunk was in the drivers seat carving a a wooden axe out of a piece of wood with another carving axe.
</p>
<p>
	SSSHCHCHCHHCRRCHCHT "COm....Pepperc.....COMe IN" a voice crackled over the all see ball. "We need.....Immed.....extraction"
</p>
<p>
	Chic Pea sat full lotus in the air floating holding her staff out conjuring the power to break through the miles of earth above them and whatever magical shit was going on in this shit hole.
</p>
<p>
	"Chic Pea!" Fred yelled. "We gotta move....NOW" All around the room mechanical golden spiders were crawling toward them. Each with a red gem in their compound eyes. Each glowing red with hate.
</p>
<p>
	"Axewound" Fred yelled. "WHat in the absollute DICKS have you unleashed?"
</p>
<p>
	"Oh....I'm flattered again big boy" She said. "But this isn't me. This is the just the way it is now and I'd rather be on the other end of the 'getting fucked in the ass by an army of robot spiders' stick. Anyway toodles" She said as she skulked back into the shadows and snapped her way out of the story....I mean mines.
</p>
<p>
	Fred picked up a golden ancient sword, of elvish make, and read the runes on the blade. 
</p>
<p>
	"Bitch Rage" he read. "Fuckin sick" he swung the sword around. It felt right.
</p>
<p>
	PUNCH IT GUNK. Peppercorn yelled. It was pointless though Gunk had already started accelerating the boner wagon to the frong gates, the vehicle still invisible. As it reached the pain mines proper Gunk started mowing down guards. None of them knew what was happening all they could see was a blood stained...SOMETHING coming at them. Each time Gunk hit a guard more blood and viscera would accumulate on the hood of the van. All anyone could see was a front end of some kind of bone van just truckin through the mines.
</p>
<p>
	Fred swung and hit a spider in the eye. It hissed and sizzled. Inside the red gem cracked open and consumed itself in flame. Other golden spiders gathered around their now dead arachnid friend and began to intake the essence of the cracked red shard. They turned toward Fred with more fury than before. Fred swung again and this time the lead Spider held up a hand...arm? uh a spider leg and blocked the blow.
</p>
<p>
	"They're adapting" Yelled fred back to Chic Pea. Fred parried and riposoted and weilded Bitch Rage like heroes of old. Just as they were about to overtake them a chanting of magical phrases boomed from behind.
</p>
<p>
	"FREEZUS BAJEESUS PLEASUS" Yelled Chic Pea. A torrent of ice and frozen sludge cascaded over the attacking bots freezing them solid. Some of their gems broke and just like before the surviving spiders sucked up the essence. The ice began to crack.
</p>
<p>
	"We gotta go NOW" yelled Fred. Just then an evil evil laugh rose from the darkened throne. It rose from a chuckle to a full blown crazy person doing a bad cosplay joker impmression in a second. Slowly a dark red glow shown through the pitch blackness that was once surrounding the throne. Suddenly a burst of red light shot accross teh room and all the spiders wriggled free of their icy chains. On the throne sat...
</p>
<p>
	"Lady Crumbus...." Chic Pea said 
</p>
<p>
	"I am her....and I am not her." The voice said. From within the 12 foot tall ogres chest a red light glowed like a beating heart. Instead of blood this heart pumped hate. Pure red hatred.
</p>
<p>
	"GIVE ME YOUR LIGHT" It screamed. The scream pierced their ears and blood trickled down them.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly because this episode is waaaay too long already Fred saw what looked like a bloody van hood? It tore through the spiders from the entrance, did a donut over some of the less dead ones, and skid parked right next to Fred, Chic, and Duncan.
</p>
<p>
	"Get in" yelled Peppercorn firing crossbow bolts out of his crossbow gattling contraption.
</p>
<p>
	Fred picked up Duncan and Chic Pea floated into the van. 
</p>
<p>
	"GUNK" she yelled. "PUNCH IT" 
</p>
<p>
	The crew sped off out of hte throne room and tore ass out of the mines. But wait how did the van take the elevator you ask? Well it didn't there's a service entrance you fuckin dorks. Immerse yourself and quit tryinig to be clever all the time. Nobody likes your star wars critisizing input. Twitter will be dead soon hopefully so keep it to yourself.
</p>
<p>
	Outside the Boner Wagon sputtered to a halt. They had made it. The Pain Mine guards were desperately tryinig to round up the hundreds of inmates who were nowo either rioting on escaping AND rioting.
</p>
<p>
	Duncan awoke and shot up. "WE NEED TO LEAVE" he said.
</p>
<p>
	Chic Pea soothed him with a healing spell which smelled like lavander. Gunk got out and started cleaning the hood of the van off. There were fuckin guts ALL OVER that thing.
</p>
<p>
	"We made it" Fred said putting a hand on Duncan's shoulder.
</p>
<p>
	"Lady Crumbus?" Duncan asked already knowing the asnwer.
</p>
<p>
	"NAAAhhh dude she ded as fuck" Fred said as he gripped his new sword thinking back to the the nightmamre they had just escaped.
</p>
<p>
	Duncan stood up and exited the van. He stood next to Gunk and watched as the prisoners set fire to like every damn thing and killed a shit ton more guards. Duncan turned to look at Gunk who was still cleaning the hood. Duncan grabbed for a piece of bone under the wheel and pulled out an entire spine and skull.
</p>
<p>
	"Hey Gunk" he said tossing him the spine. "Souvenir buddy"
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah" Gunk said smiling. "I guess Van duty isn't so bad."
</p>
<p>
	FIN
</p>
<p>
	Post credit scene:
</p>
<p>
	The crew consoles Lord Crumbus as he weeps for the death of his beloved ogre wife.
</p>
<p>
	"What...(sniff)...what am I gonna do now?" He said completely heartbroken.
</p>
<p>
	"Here" Duncan said handing him a golden fleshlite. "You're going to be just fine"
</p>
