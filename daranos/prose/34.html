<p>
	Cowboys and Fungus
</p>
<p>
	Pee Van Queef
</p>
<p>
	D'ant the cowboy ant
</p>
<p>
	Scrabbles Dant
</p>
<p>
	Cowboys from Heck
</p>
<p>
	 The Souther Regions of Daranos will take your life for just looking at it's sandy mama in a comely manner. If waking up in the middle of the night with cotton mouth while getting a sloppy toppy from someone who also has cotton mouth and sandpaper for a tongue and steel wool for tonsels were a geographical region, that'd be souther big D. This shit will suck the life out of your peener and not like your mama did to my peener last night after we smoked an entire pound of Daranosian Dank. That bitch knows how to work a sandpaper tongue.
</p>
<p>
	Scrabbles Dant chewed on a piece of grass and sucked on what little moisture was left in mandables. SPITOOON! The sound of his spit hitting the ground caused his Scorpihorse to chitter under him.
</p>
<p>
	"There there Penelope" he said patting her on her carapace. She vibrated in what I assume bugs do when their tiny 3 neuron brains experience what apparently is called "Happiness"? I dont know I've never experienced anything like that for myself but I hear its pretty...pretty nifty.
</p>
<p>
	ANYWAY!
</p>
<p>
	On the horizon glittering in the heat waves Dant saw movement. He squinted his giant compound eyes and spit out another gob of whatever ant men have in their mouths. Penelope lurched in nervous agitation.
</p>
<p>
	"Whoa girl its ok...this is why we're here, remember?" Dant said again patting his mulilegged mount. I dont know I think they have 8 legs but I'm not looking that shit up bc its midnight and I'm not trying to get the spookie ookies before I go to bed at 4am.
</p>
<p>
	Coming into view were 3 Scorpihorses with 3 men atop of them. Men being a relative description of the hunks of villanous dog vomit that haunted these wastelands and tortured, stole, or pillaged their way through anyone that had something that they wanted.
</p>
<p>
	"Well if it isn't Scrabbles D'ant...." Said a Red Ant man who was the apparent leader. "Scrabble huh....can I buy a vowel?"
</p>
<p>
	His lackies laughed a forced laugh at his joke. One he probably was thinking about the whole ride out to this spot in hopes of meeting up with Scrabbles so he could burn him so fucking good. If that burned didn't bleach Scrabble's carapace the suns would. 
</p>
<p>
	"That's not how you play the famous Milton Bradley board game, Scrabble..." Dant said spitting yet again onto the hot sands. "You'd know that if you could read, Red Rixx" Dan't continued.
</p>
<p>
	Red Rixx, the leader of Red Rixx's Rowdy Raiders and Vice President of the Southern Wastes Scholastic Book Faire squinted as the words from Dant burned his ego like the hot suns were burning his red ant skin? Sure lets just say skin.
</p>
<p>
	"You came all this way to die in the middle of this gods foresaken shit pit?" Rixx said with a smile.
</p>
<p>
	"WE CAN READ!" Snorted a warthog guy lackie. Rixx turned slowly around.
</p>
<p>
	"WE'VE MOVED PAST THAT, SNIFTY!" Rixx shouted back.
</p>
<p>
	Snifty's Scropihorse shuffled backwards as if it knew how much of an embarrassing idiot Snifty was. Snifty would later cry himself to sleep knowing that he told a bald faced lie about reading. He could read writing just about as well as he could read a room or read a social situation and know when not to be a complete fucking liabity in every sense of the word. 
</p>
<p>
	"Why can't you be more like Dink over here?" Rixx said still scolding Snifty. Dink, the other lacky, sat atop his scorpihorse picking his kobold nose and giggling. Dink probably had severe brain damage from many years of fighting and falling off his scorpihorse. If you took an MRI of Dink's brain it'd look like a delicious wedge of cheese from a Tom and Jerry cartoon that was double teamed by Rich and Jeff's TRGW's after the cheese, who was also somehow Rich and Jeff's step sister?, got stuck in a dryer and couldn't get out with sex or so I'm led to believe is what happens in those pornos. Parnos? Am I saying it right I don't really know anything about them.
</p>
<p>
	"Lets get this over with" Dant interrupted just in time for you to forget that I totally don't watch porn.
</p>
<p>
	"You will try..." Rixx said all cool like Anakin did in that movie. Anakin Skywalker's Big Day Out.
</p>
<p>
	Scrabbles Dant dismounted Penelope and grabbed for the repeating single shot magical blunder buster at his side while also unsheating a jagged ebony broadsword from his back sheath. The darkness of the blade sucked in light and was probably symbolic of Dant's blackened burnt twisting hatred for the Red Ant colony. It was like if Vanta Black had a baby with your mom's cavernous crotch cave and made some sort of perfect black void of abyssal horror that wouldn't allow you to exit not matter how much you screamed and pleaded. I'll be a good boy this time Cave Mommy just let me out! I have a fantasy orcsball draft to get to! Its importatnt. It's like DnD for jock kids!
</p>
<p>
	ANYWAY.
</p>
<p>
	"You are one cocky and stupid queef of a queen" Rixx said laughing. With a "HEEYA" he kicked the side of his scorihorse and the 3 Rixx Raiders all encircled Dant.
</p>
<p>
	"I'll dig your grave as shallow as your honor" Dant said with a smirk.
</p>
<p>
	"GET HIM BOYS" Rixx shouted. 
</p>
<p>
	Snifty shot a blazing hot fire bolt from his crossbow. With a jerk of his wrist Dant blocked the bolt with his ebony sword. It's clang was dulled by the cold ebony metal. In one motion he spun and aimed his blunder buster right at Rixx's stupid antenna sucking face, but before he could get a clean shot Dink's scorpihorse was rearing up and blocking his view. Dant rolled underneath the scorpihorse as it slammed down onto the sands with a thud. Penelope for her part was already grappling with Dink and his scorpihorse. She and the other scorpion were using their tails to guage and prod for an opening. 
</p>
<p>
	Dant used this opportunity to find Snifty. With a giant leap he launched himself onto Snifty's steed. Snifty snorted and screamed as he tried to buck Dant off. With a single blow Dant used his pommel to brain Snifty. Then he pistol whipped the pig man like all pig men should be pistol whipped. Snifty fell from his scorpihorse with a thud onto the sand. Penelope quickly chittered over and with one hoist of her claw pilcked up the pigglet. With a scream Snifty grabbed at her giant claws. They slowly clasped together and with a final gurgle the two halves of Snifty fell to the ground.
</p>
<p>
	"My only regert.....is....I never....learned to.......read" were his last words as his blood watered the dry sands.
</p>
<p>
	Rixx had pulled out two blunder blasters and was shooting magical bolts of energy at a 6th grade level.
</p>
<p>
	Dant rolled and twisted like he was playing a Souls game. Each shot just missing him until SNAP. A bolt landed right onto his muscly ant arm. Green ooze gurgled out of hte wound but Dant didn't make a sound. He saw the blood and rage filled his eyes. Rixx's scorpion was towering over him screaming and raising its claws. With a swift downward motion the scorpihorse slammed one claw down just missing Dant while the other landed where Dant had dodged to. Dant grabbed the claw with both arms. Pain and agony shot through his left arm where he was wounded. He could feel the green ooze slorping out it. He gritted his mandables and used all his ant strength as Dragonlady by Crimson Glory began to play.
</p>
<p>
	"Time to die Scrabbles Dant" Rixx said with a smile.
</p>
<p>
	As the music swelled and the singer began that one super cool reverberated scream, Dant summoned all of his strenght and pried open the claws ripping the claws from the arm. He swung the serated giant claw half around and around and let it fly. The last thing Rixx saw was a dope ass claw flying through the air as it severed his head from his thorax. 
</p>
<p>
	"AH FUCK SHIT AHH MY HEAD AND THORAX" Rixx's head said as it hit the ground. "Scrabbles I'm sorry I'll...make it up to you....here I have gold!" Rixx's decapitated head kept talking because bugs ya know? As he said this his now headless body pulled a large gold bar out of a satchel and handed it to Dant and then shrugged.
</p>
<p>
	"I'll...I'll put in a good word with you to the Queen..." Rixx pleaded. This did not please Scrabbles.
</p>
<p>
	"The only thing I want from your queen is her slow and painful death at the hands of my...uh...hands!" Dant said all cool like.
</p>
<p>
	"HEHEHEHEH You'll never find our colony AND YOU'LL NEVER FREE THE BLACK ANTS" Rixx said with a cough and a laugh.
</p>
<p>
	Dant whistled and Penelope skittered over to him. The headless body of Rixx turned to see the giant scropihorse learing over it. It shrugged its shoulders down in acceptence as Rixx said only "Oh rat farts". Then with one bite Penelope devoured the body of Rixx leaving only his chattery obnoxious head.
</p>
<p>
	"YOU'LL NEVER FIND IT!!!!!" Rixx kept shouting as Dant mounted Penelope. He looked over to see Dink still picking his nose and giggling. Dant shot him a look.
</p>
<p>
	"Nah dude I'm cool fuck this I'm out" Dink said as he pulled a crossbow from his back and shot himself in the face. Dant whistled and the remaining Scropihorses followed in a line as to hide their numbers. 
</p>
<p>
	"That's right Penelope" He said patting her. "We're headed to Boobylon"
</p>
<p>
	Boobylon lay ahead in the soft glow of dusk. A giant ancient city who's walls were so high that they made your mother's gargantuan vaginal walls look like the wall of Hadrian. Look it up. The city itself was rectangular and over the top of the city was a massive brided walkway where troops and lookouts used to uh...do troop stuff and look out. Now the city was run by merchants and wealthy. Dant thought the whole city looked like a giant picnic basket, which he then thought was stereotyical of him but it was ok he himself was an Ant Man so its ok. 
</p>
<p>
	In fact some say the Cat Men of the desert built the city and abonded it. Other's say giants went out for a picnic one day and left their basket behind where it became the foundation of an ancient civilization. Yet others say aliens built it. I think we can all agree that the latter are absolutely correct. No further questions. Case closed.
</p>
<p>
	As Dant and his train of Scorpihorses rolled into the city he could smell the scent of exotic spices. Cardamom and saffron mingled with the stench of rot gut liquor and the glitter of giggle dirt in the air. This place made Vice City look like Nice City. That's a video game reference I've filled my quota for the year and we JUST got it in folks thank you.
</p>
<p>
	Dant sold the 3 extra scropihorses and put Penelope into the poshest corale he could find. She'd have a mani pedi and come back later with her claws painted up like a hoopty from a sick Brazillian rap video.
</p>
<p>
	Dant looked up to see a sign. "The Bog Hole" he said with a hmmf. "Sounds familiar" he said to himself. As he walked into the saloon the crowd was already rowdy. On the bar some 3 titted goblin was Coyote Uglying as partrons threw various treasures and precious metals. A troll was doing karaoke in the corner and doing a pretty good rendition of "Forgot About Dreg" a classic from the late 6990s. Various beings were doing dirty dancing moves which were now just called "Dance moves" because I dont know if you know this but humans have been dancing like that for as long as there were both humans and dancing. Putting your junk up in another persons booty and touching them is pretty much the first thing we did to have fun so quit clutching your pearls, BABY, and get back in the corner where you belong you prude cracker honkey toddler.
</p>
<p>
	Dant rolled up to the bar and tugged on the bartenders tunic to get his attention. 
</p>
<p>
	"You want a Fungus Froth?" He said to Dant. "Best in the city!" Dant just shook his head.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm looking for information" Dant said curtly.
</p>
<p>
	"If you want info you're gonna have to buy something pal" The bartender said pointing to the already poured mug of frothy ale.
</p>
<p>
	Dant smiled and nodded. "Sure pal" he said grabbing the mug and throwing down a chit of silver.
</p>
<p>
	"The Bog Hole..." Dant said to the bartender. "There's a Bog Hole down near the southern tower" he went on.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah we're a franchise" the bartender said half paying attention. "What? You think just because we're a godsforsaken wasteland full of backward inbred homuculus people we don't have franchises? You think West Virginia doesn't have McDonalds's? You think Plymouth England doesn't have Meat Boxes or whatever the fuck those weirdos eat over there?"
</p>
<p>
	Dant sipped his ale gently and raised his eye brows like Keenan from Good Burger. 
</p>
<p>
	"Is that all you wanted to know Ant Man?" said the tender.
</p>
<p>
	Dant threw down a gold bar and turned it over.
</p>
<p>
	"I actually want to know if you know anything about this?" Dant said pointing to two symbols branded into the gold. One was the tribal symbol of the Red And Colony. An ant head throwing up the devil horns. The other was a mysterious ancient looking symbol.
</p>
<p>
	"That's red ant gold...." The bartender said giving it only a cursory glance. "Lotta that stuff coming through Boobylon these days."
</p>
<p>
	"Any idea where I can find this colony?" Dant said as gently as possible.
</p>
<p>
	The bartender scoffed. "Look pal it doesn't take a genius to see that you, a black ant, ain' t want nothing to do with that place. Even Hellen Orckeller could see that you going there would be a terrible idea. But no...I dont konw where the colony is." He finished and began whiping up a shelf behind him.
</p>
<p>
	Dant threw down another couple chits of silver and a gem the size of your mothers engorged clitorous.
</p>
<p>
	"How about now?" Dant said
</p>
<p>
	"Pally guy...I still don't know guy friend pal." He said looking over his shoulder at the new pile of loot.
</p>
<p>
	Dant reached into his pack and pulled out an original copy of the constitution and that one stamp with the airplane thats upside down and threw it into the pile
</p>
<p>
	"Now?" Dant asked.
</p>
<p>
	"Friend amigo chief dude friend guy....I still don't know" the bartender said pocketing the loot.
</p>
<p>
	Dant once more reached into his loot sack and pulled out the Maltese Falcon, a Babe Ruth rookie card in mint condition rated at a 9.9, a black lotus (the card not the actual plant that grows everywhere in Daranos), a monkeys paw with 2 wishes left, and a chocolate cupcake that was said to be magical. If you ate it, it would only regenerate itself so you'd have infinite magical chocolate cupcakes. It's like everyday is your birthday if you enjoy your birthday. I myself dont care for the day I was brought into this living hell void where I have no choice but to partake in the assanine game of existence that leaves most people souless and dead inside before the age of 45.
</p>
<p>
	"I maaaaaaaay have heard a rumor" The bartender said as he pocketed the remaining loot and leaned in to whisper into Dants antennae
</p>
<p>
	"Ppspspsppspspps" he said as the camera craned upward and the 3 titted Goblin was still going at it on the bar.
</p>
<p>
	Dant could see the stars more clearly than he had been able to in months. The two badonkalicious moons of Daranos were in their new moon phase. The tiny slivers of light they gave off let the stars behind them shine through. Dant could see purple and red and even some golds in the cosmos above.
</p>
<p>
	"Stay here Penny" he said to his steed. She chittered in agreeement.
</p>
<p>
	Dant reached into his satchel and pulled out a telescoping view finder. He clicked the handle and images of various things appeared. One was Grover from Sesame Street. Another was a T Rex fighting a stegosaurus. Finally he reached the panel that allowed him to zoom in magically over great distances. In the distance he saw 2 red ants with spears guarding...nothing. There was nothing around them. Only a small hill that looked exactly like every other fucking sand dune in this shit piss and jizz hole of a desert.
</p>
<p>
	"How am I gonna get close without them seeing me...?" Dant thought to himself. He dissappointedly dropped the view master from his eyes and looked at Penelope with a sigh. She was preening herself with her done up painted claws. Red and orange flames with peace signs and for some reason a volkswagen symbol? Did someone think that was a peace sign? I can see how maybe that would be confusing but trust me the origins of that particular bonecar compny are anything but peace related.
</p>
<p>
	"Wait" Dant said aloud. "Penelope YOU GENIUS!" he said running over to her and kissing her head. She chitterd in happiness.
</p>
<p>
	Dant confidently walked toward the 2 guards being mindful of what that one troll jester said during his comedy set at The Laughing Stocks club. "Red ants be all like huuuuhhhh hhuuh while black ants be all heeeeey heeeeey" he said quietly to himself. 
</p>
<p>
	"HALT WHO GOES THERE" said Red ant guard 1.
</p>
<p>
	Dant looked up from under his wide brimmed hat and the guards only saw...another ant. Dant had used the claw polish from Penelope to go full blown red face. NOW NOW NOW BEFORE YOU START TO WRITE YOUR ANGRY EMAILS AND TWEETS remember these are ants and any symbology associated to "red" in terms of races here on earth doesn't translate to Daranos. PLUS BELIEVE ME THESE RED ASS MOTHER FUCKERS HAVE IT COMING!
</p>
<p>
	"Hello fellow red ants" Dant said with his boringest accent. "Pleasant night out isn't it? Whats with all this no rain am I right?" he finished with a sensible chortle.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh another red ant" Said ant guard 2. "Well go right in sir. Us red ants got to stick together am I right? Not like those black ants. YOU KNOW HOW THEY ARE AM I RIGHT FELLOW RED ANTERS!"
</p>
<p>
	Dant supressed his rage and laughed fakely. "I know that is correct my red carapaced brethren" Dant said with that tinge of vomit stinging his throat. 
</p>
<p>
	With that Dant entered a secret entrance as  a stone door closed behind him to looke just like the dune of sand. Outside he could hear the guards still laughing.
</p>
<p>
	"Hey we should make red hats thats say MAGA on them" Guard 2 continued. "Make Ants Great and Allred"
</p>
<p>
	"That's too many words what if we just had a symbol like something instantly recognizable. Like maybe it has like six or NO...four arms coming out of a center point? I'm just splitballing here nothing is set in stone" Guard 1 went on.
</p>
<p>
	Their racist voices faded out as Dant descended into the ground.
</p>
<p>
	The air grew stale and the humidity rose to tropical levels as Dant slowly and stealthily made his way down down down into this red hell. He could hear the clang of tools and the shouts of men. He ducked behind a stalactmite and peered down into a pit of molten fire and heat. There he saw his kin, black ants, all being used as forced labor for the red ants. The sight, even though he had told himself he was ready to see it and KNEW what was happening here, still infuriated him. There were no curses in the tongues of men nor ant men that described the rage he felt inside his thorax. He gripped the grip of his blunder buster and thought about just going full blown rage monster right then and there. And he'd be justified in doing so. Every single red ass mother fucker in this place needed to bleed and pay for this. He'd kill them all.
</p>
<p>
	"No..." he thought as he released his white knuckled grip on his buster. "You can't help them if you're dead...."
</p>
<p>
	"GET BACK TO VERK YOU USELESS KAPUT BLIESTIFF PEENER" said a guard red ant as he slapped a young black ant who was lifting up a large rock. The worker ant flinched but took the hit. Out of the corner of his eye he saw a glistening black compound eye. Dant ducked back down. The worker ant went on with his work not giving anything away.
</p>
<p>
	Dant moved closer and waited until a shift whistle blew like in old timey cartoons. He imagined the whistle even like did that scream animation like it was actually yelling. Focus Scrabbles! he thought.
</p>
<p>
	The black worker ant moved into a room carrying a sack which looked heavy. Kind of like my sack ISN'T after your sweet mama drains all the white gold from it after you go to bed to listen to your zoobooks or pokemans or whatever you kids are into.
</p>
<p>
	The worker ant dropped the sack with a thud. He stretched his back and spread is arms wide. Guards at the door looked on as another guard picked up the sack and moved it. Dant slowly skulked into the room. It was dark enough for him to blend in. The worker ant let out an overly exaggerated yawn and dropped his pick axe. 
</p>
<p>
	"Ah my bad guys just...so much work to do ya know?" He said as he knelt down to pick up his axe.
</p>
<p>
	With this Dant unsheathed his broad sword and cleaved a red guard in twain. His right half sliding stickily downward as gravity overtook his internal organ's viscocity. His left side still standing there spurting green goo and blork every which way.
</p>
<p>
	"OH FUCK SHIT" said another guard as he turned to jab his spear into Dant. Dant dodged and the guards thrust was interruped by a metal spike plunging through his eye socket. Behind him the worker ant held onto the handle of a pick axe. The guard who was carrying the sack dropped it in a heap and ran toward a rope alarm to alert his commrades. With one flip of his wrist Scrabbles Dant quick drew his blaster and a magical bolt of electrical power shot forth hitting the guard in the side of the head. His head exploded in a spray of brains and goo. His body still lurching forward however and managing to graspe the rope and ...Puuuuuulll ever so sllowly as bells and torches began to alight all around.
</p>
<p>
	"Well shit in my dick" Dant said.
</p>
<p>
	"Scrabbles....I knew it was you!" Said the worker ant. 
</p>
<p>
	"Dantoino" Scrabbles Dant said as he moved to hug the ant. "My brother...You...you're here"
</p>
<p>
	"No time for love Doctor Dant" Dantonio said picking up a spear. "We need to get out of here."
</p>
<p>
	Scrabbles was half listening as he looked around the storage room. All around them were gold bricks. From ceiling to floor. Rows and rows of gold stamped with the red ant symbol and the mysterious spooky symbol.
</p>
<p>
	"SCRABBLES" Dantonio shouted getting his brother's attenion. "We need to leave."
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly a cadre of red minons burst through the door.
</p>
<p>
	"Hold it right there!" Said Red Guard 1 who was now wearing a red hat that said MAGA or "Make Ants gRED Again" with a small g. 
</p>
<p>
	"That doesn't even make any sense..." Dantonio said with a frown. 
</p>
<p>
	"Neither does the existence of your speices" Said a commander ant from behind them.
</p>
<p>
	"Wow thats EXTREMELY racist and totally on brand I guess but still....whew boy" Dantonio said with a sigh.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly Red Guard 1's head exploded in a spray of gloop and slorp. Behind Dantonio Scrabbles Dant was pointing his buster gun outward.
</p>
<p>
	"ENOUGH" said the commander ant. "We kill you all unless you surrender" he said cracking a riding crop for some reason who knows probably sex related.
</p>
<p>
	Dantonio dropped his spear and looked back at his brother. Dant was still holding his gun defiantly. He would NOT let this red fucks take him and his brother. He would not let them continue this reign of terror. He would NOT let them spank him with that sexy riding crop....unless....NO....No he would not.
</p>
<p>
	Dant dropped the gun. As soon as he did a squad of ants surrounded the intruder and knocked him and his brother to the ground. Dant and Dantonio cursed and spat at the red ants.
</p>
<p>
	"Now...shall vee see what General Antler has to say about zis hmmm?" said the commander ant as he wrung his hands together.
</p>
<p>
	TO BE ANTINUED
</p>
