<p>
	"It's her!" shouted a filthy degenerate peasant poor at Ugla. Her rune magic to enhance her all see ball in order to contact the past was fading but it had already done more damage than an Ice Man in a pre warp civilization.
</p>
<p>
	"SIGN MY BIBLE" Screamed another.
</p>
<p>
	"SIGN MY TITTIES WHICH HAVE JOHN 3:16 IN KILLIGREW FONT AND STONE COLD TATTOOD ON THEM!" Shouted another.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla slumped down in disappointment even as the crowd slowly frothed itself up into a cum frenzy over her use of magic. 
</p>
<p>
	"SIGN MY DICK WHICH HAS A TATTOO OF A PAIR OF TITS WITH JOHN 3:16 IN KILLIGREW FONT"
</p>
<p>
	"ENOUGH" Ugla shouted standing up on her feet. 
</p>
<p>
	The crowd fell silent as the John 3:16 boob lady sheethed her massive sweater slammers.
</p>
<p>
	"Boooooo" shouted a guy in the backround.
</p>
<p>
	Now here is where I could probably call them breast bazookas or big bad boobie bazookas or boobzookas and get away with an easy out for this weeks prompt. But I assure you we here at (Insert podcast name here) respect our audience too much to take the easy way out. Even if we were up all last night procrastinating writing this story and too busy looking at yo sweet mama's boobzooka's because she won't stop texting us her chest yams and saying what a disappointment you've been as a child.
</p>
<p>
	"Don't you backwoods hillbilly dirt humpers have magic here?!" Ugla shouted.
</p>
<p>
	"Pardon my insolence oh magic one" a tiny gnome boy said quietly. "But we ain't had magic 'ere since the Great Mana Drought. Some call it The Mana Burn but we all decided that was too close to the plot of Star Trek Discovery and didn't want to be associated with such bad writing. We here are good writers" Said the gnome boy looking directly at the camera fourth wallery.
</p>
<p>
	"Wait why can I use magic then?" Ugla asked. The crowd all shrugged and started murmering.
</p>
<p>
	"I just thought you were a big titted space jesus" one orc said from teh background.
</p>
<p>
	"It is because you are SPECIAL" a familiar voice cut through the murmering idiots of the crowd. There stood Reeses the Wize well...There stood Reeses the Wize wearing another face beard and mustach and an eye patch.
</p>
<p>
	"It is I!" He proclaimed to the crowd. "Your deacon of divination, the mage of mischief, the wizard of wavery place himself! Feces the Disguise!"
</p>
<p>
	The crowd bowed down and began to chant in various tongues. As 'Feces' passed many dropped to their knees and prayed.
</p>
<p>
	"KISS MY BABY, FECES" screamed one onlooker thrower her baby at Feces but missing him completely as the baby landed in the cucumber vendors basket just as time ran out in the 3rd quarter.
</p>
<p>
	"Reeses...."sighed Ugla. "You sent us to the wrong time! You fucking IDIOT YOU SENT US TO THE FUTURE!" 
</p>
<p>
	"That's FECES the Disguise my dear." Reeses waved his hands. "And this is my flock. We have long awaited the return of the magical one who would help save our lands."
</p>
<p>
	"Mewmew mew mew mew mewww" Buffcat said.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah you look exactly like Reeses but with an eye patch and other beard and mustache" Demi said. "Plus you didnt even take the tag off of the fake beard and mustache. And the tag says 'Mophismos Wizard Costumes and Disguise Beards"
</p>
<p>
	"I dont know who this 'Reeses'? Reeses was it?" Feces said. "I dont know who this person is but just judging by his name I can tell he is extremely handsome and has a totally real giant weiner AND that that TRGW totally still works. That's...that's something magic users in the future can tell from just hearing a name...its a real power we have dont look into it."
</p>
<p>
	"Look" Ugla said as everyone in the crowd began to look around as if she was ordering them to look.
</p>
<p>
	"No....I mean....listen" she said again as everyone in the crowd began to put their ears to the ground or strain to hear something.
</p>
<p>
	"What do you want us to do here, Reeses!" Ugla finally yelled. "You wouldn't have sent us here without some stupid motiv or you need a new wizard sleeve fleshlight or you lost your damn wizard keys here or something completely stupid and pointless."
</p>
<p>
	"Well IF you were looking to get back to the past you must first find the Time Temple" Feces said. Everyone in the crowd whispered "Time Temple" all at once like a real weird cult.
</p>
<p>
	"There you will find what you need in order to master time and complete your quest" Feces said.
</p>
<p>
	"Complete the quest" the crowd whispered in unicen.
</p>
<p>
	"So sayeth the Time KING!" Feces raised his hands. 
</p>
<p>
	"TIME KING" shouted the crowd.
</p>
<p>
	"Now if you'll excuse me it is time for the 3pm Time Orgy. EVERYONE! TO MY BUNGALO!" Feces yelled.
</p>
<p>
	"TIME ORGY TIME ORGY TIME ORGY" Shouted the crowd as they did a conga line to 'Feces' bungalo.
</p>
<p>
	"OH you KNOW I BE BRINGING THESE CUCUMBERS!" said the cucumber man from last episode.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew mewmew" BUffcat said rubbing his snoot and shaking his head.
</p>
<p>
	"He didn't even tell us which way to go?" Demi said looking like that little girl from that one gif.
</p>
<p>
	"GO WEST YOUNG MAN" Feces shouted over the shouts of 'Time Orgy' from like a football field away. That's American football, Rich. It's 100 yards about the same as a Soccer field but not as wide and its players have a much shorter life span due to their brains being scrambled up like plate of brown eggs at Meat Box IF you can get a ticket. If you see Anya Taylor-Joy next to you go, Rich, please give her my number and also be sure to run because I'm pretty sure Meat Box is a The Menu situation and your ass is getting hanged.
</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile Axl the Dragon soared through the air like he did for the cover of Wife Bones' seminal album entitled "Hi Honey I'm BONE!". As he landed Axewound released his golden reigns and he felt like himself again. More whole. He gasped for air and tried to find his bearings. They were at the Temple again. On the dragon perch he had been standing on days earlier. That being one of hte last things her remembers clearly.
</p>
<p>
	"Now you stay here Axl darling, mommy just has to slip into something a little more...shorter" Axewound said. She waved her hands around as green magic zitted and jolted off her body. The magic was powerful. So powerful when the green haze settled Axl saw that Axewound had turned herself into a dwarf maiden. She was shorter obviously but also much more homely. Not the comely whips and chains princess Axl had riding on his back for these past few weeks.
</p>
<p>
	"Now you stay here Axl" Axewound held up her staff and made a BWEEP BWEEP sound with her mouth like a car alarm would. This caused Axl's golden reins to turn into chains and glow a bright yellow as they too crackled with magical power. Axl winced as on bolt zitted past his nose and stung his nostrils.
</p>
<p>
	"Honey, I'm HOOOOOOME" shouted Axewound in dwarf form.
</p>
<p>
	"AH RUBY" a deep dwarvish voice called from below."My sweet sweet Ruby"
</p>
<p>
	"My sweet sweet Gunk" Said Axewound as she marched over to Gunk and planted a straight up first base kiss onto his manly dwarven mouth.
</p>
<p>
	"Ruby Rubbleborn...you are something else" Gunk said as he dropped his work hammer from the sheer PG-13ness of the kiss.
</p>
<p>
	"Awww my sweet. I brought some sourdough bread for my very hungry inventor man. In here all day tinkerin and thinkerin. Making inventions to better Daranos." Ruby said with a bat of her lashes as she held out a loaf of delicious sourdough bread.
</p>
<p>
	"You are a keeper, Ruby" Gunk said sounding happier than he had ever been.
</p>
<p>
	"So how's the invention coming along, honey" she asked running a finger over the Quantum Communicator.
</p>
<p>
	"I almost have it repaired. I'll need a few more parts which I think I can get and to test it of course but once I do I'll be able to contact anyone in anytime!" Gunk turned around and looked at an all see picture of he and Duncan singing a shantee at a bar. Good thing it wasn't an All hear ball too if ya know what I mean.
</p>
<p>
	"And what of the...modifications I recommended?" Axewound pretended to fiddle with a transistor as her back was turend to Gunk. She side eyed him waiting for his reaction. If he didn't agree to the modifications she'd have to get...creative.
</p>
<p>
	"I did the maths on those calculations and I think it might be feasible to draw magical energy through the device but we'd need to get it just right. Any miscalculation and we might blow up the entire lab...maybe even the entire continent. There's just no way of knowing what it'd do" Gunk continued to work on the Communicator.
</p>
<p>
	"Peppercorn would be good at that type of math and of course Chic Pea could tell us more about the magical output but..." he trailed off. "Hey unless you're a secret wizard and can do that kind of quantum mathmatics?" Gunk said jokingly as he turned around to smile at Ruby.
</p>
<p>
	"hehe" she fake laughed. "No....no not a secret wizard" she said as her fake smile turned to a frown.
</p>
<p>
	"For now I think we focus on this as a means of communication alone" Gunk said. "And then I can warn Duncan...." he said quietly to himself trailing off.
</p>
<p>
	Outside of the temple a pair of gnomish goggles focused in on the desolate ancient temlpe that lay only a couple of miles away. On its perch sat a red dragon trying to find a comfortable position to sleep with his golden chains on. Below was the ancient temple belonging to a long gone sect of whatever cult or religion or DnD group or stamp club which had previously built it and had long been forgotten to time. Now, apparently, it was home to Axewound for some unknown reason or another.
</p>
<p>
	"She's there alright" Peppercorn said handing the goggles over to Sid.
</p>
<p>
	Sid zoomed the goggles in and saw much the same as Peppercorn did. He then passed the goggles to Fred who zoomed in again.
</p>
<p>
	"How do you want to do this?" Fred asked now handing the goggles over to Chic Pea who didn't even use them but passed them over the nearby cliff.
</p>
<p>
	"CHIC!" Peppercorn whisper yelled. "Those were a gift from Dad? Remember I got the gyro goggles and you got that 5.0 Cherry Red Bonestang with the T Tops and all see tape deck?"
</p>
<p>
	"You got screwed on that birthday, brother" Chic pea said filing her nails with a magical conjured nail file.
</p>
<p>
	"Look...we dont need any fancy plans" She said finally blowing out a bubble of magical gum. "We always do plans and they suck. We suck at plans. Lets just go in there and fuck her up the butt with magic and swords and lightning and junk and then we make her tell us what she's up to and we maybe can contact this Ugly person"
</p>
<p>
	"Ugla" Sid corrected. "But Chic's right. I dont much feel like planning this out. I came here to fuck shit up and watch Chic chew bubble gum. And it looks like Chic's all out of bubble gum" Sid said with a smile.
</p>
<p>
	"YEEEES" Fred said standing up and levying a heavy war hammer over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
	"We can't like...teleport in" Chic said. "There's no doubt magical wards up. And I detect a detection spell so we can't really just walk right up and ring the ding donger without it alerty whoever is in there."
</p>
<p>
	The Flamingos looked out over the 2 miles of desert leading to the temple. It offered no protection from sight or sun. It may have well been 2000 miles of desert. 
</p>
<p>
	"Can't you like...put a cloaking spell on us or something?" Fred asked.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah I can but like...it'll be like walking around in a sleeping bag. You won't be able to see out of the cloak just like they won't be able to see into the cloak. See it works on the idea that if you can see out of the spell the detection spell can see in and..." 
</p>
<p>
	"ALRIGHT" Sid snapped. "We get it. But its the only way. CHic please conjure us up some cloaking bags. We'll have to communicate flawlessly so we don't wander off into the desert and die."
</p>
<p>
	Soon the Flamingos were wandering aimlessly toward and away and in all different direction toward the temple.
</p>
<p>
	"Where ARE YOU GUYS" Peppercorn whisper yelled.
</p>
<p>
	"Over here" Fred said.
</p>
<p>
	"You can't just say 'over here' you DIING DONG!" Pep snapped back. "I dont even know where I am going let alone where you are going."
</p>
<p>
	"This is stupid" Sid said. "We should have planned this better."
</p>
<p>
	Just then Fred let out a monstrous ass quake of a fart.
</p>
<p>
	"HAHAHAHA" they all started laughing histerically. 
</p>
<p>
	"Shh quiet we're gonna get busted" Chic pea said. She sniffed in. "Oh my god Fred what the hell man did you shit your pantaloons?"
</p>
<p>
	"Wait!" Sid said. "Keep Farting Freddo"
</p>
<p>
	Fred let out another butt blast.
</p>
<p>
	"Follow your nose boys and girls" Fred said. 
</p>
<p>
	"UGH" he said as he his nose cracked against a hard surface. "I think we're here" he said as the rest of the Flamingos crashed into him.
</p>
<p>
	"Fred you really need to go see an apothocary dude" Peppercorn said gagging.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly inside the temple a huge magical explosion rocked the very foundations of the ancient stones.
</p>
<p>
	"WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK!?" Shouted Gunk as he tried to prevent his tools from falling to the ground.
</p>
<p>
	"They found us..."Ruby said quietly.
</p>
<p>
	"Who found us!? We were being looked for?!?!" Gunk yelled.
</p>
<p>
	"Gunky I need you to listen to me...its....its my father he doesn't want me to be with you. He...he said I have to marry a dwarven prince and he sent out bounty hunters to find me! Gunky please we have to leave I can't stand the thought of not being with you...."Axewound was really pouring it on now.
</p>
<p>
	"Ok...ok my love I'll get us out of this" Gunk said as he grabbed one of his inventions off of the rack. The Brazooka.
</p>
<p>
	Built during the Topless Wars the Brazooka was meant to instantly and effectively fire a bra covering up any uncovered tiddy. Of course we all know who won those wars...the fans.
</p>
<p>
	"Hold it right there Axe.....what...."Sid said stopping mid sentence perplexed. "Gunk...what the hell are you doing here?"
</p>
<p>
	"YOU!" Gunk shouted up at Sid. "YOU CAN'T HAVE HER!" He screamed firing the brazooka. It's recoil sent him stumbling backward as a wad of over the shoulder boulder holster shot out at twice the speed of sound. It found its mark landing right on Peppercorn's face smothering him and knocking him back off of the wall. He hit the sand below with a  thud.
</p>
<p>
	"Niiiiicce" he said sniffing in deeply.
</p>
<p>
	THOOMP Gunk opened up the brazooka's chamber and loaded in another bra shell. Agent Projectiletuer was written on the side.
</p>
<p>
	"What the hell man?" Sid said as he super hero landed on the temple floor. He unsheathed Socks and held the sword out infront of him. The thin edge of the sword bisecting his now very serious and angry face.
</p>
<p>
	THOOOMP Gunk fired again. The projectile was headed straight for Sid but Sid didn't even flinch. He held Socks firm as the bra hit the sword and was cut in twain. Each cup fluttered and fell harmlessly to the floor.
</p>
<p>
	"GUNK!" Fred shouted landing next to Sid. "Where is AXEWOUND?! She's here somewhere! Listen to us we're your friends!"
</p>
<p>
	Gunk looked over toward Ruby who was cowering in the corner, tears running down her face.
</p>
<p>
	"...Who the FUCK is AXEWOUND!?" he yelled. "You can't have my Ruby. Tell her father she won't marry the prince!" 
</p>
<p>
	"What the fuck are YOU TALKING ABOUT!?" Sid yelled.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh no....I think he has the Monk Rabies. A case of the ole Mirky Jerkies. The ole Squirrely Shilres. The Foam Flim Flams.A case of the" Chic Pea said.
</p>
<p>
	"YEAH WE GOT IT!" Fred yelled. He raised his hammer and swung it toward Gunk. He was only aiming to maim and not kill but Gunk was a seasons brawler. He used the brazooka to shoot himself up into the air like Counter Strike style and then he 360 no scoped Fred in the back of his head with a roundhouse kick. Gunk's metal boots clanged against the bone and flesh of Fred's skull instantly knocking him uncouncious. Fred slid face first across the floor stopping only when his lifeless body hit a worktable.
</p>
<p>
	Chic Pea shot a bubble spell at Ruby in hopes of protecting her but also capturing her. The Flamingos could interogate her. But just as she went to cast the spell her staff was knocked out of her hands. 
</p>
<p>
	"What the actual shit?" She said. She looked down at Ruby and saw that Ruby had made a rune in the air which she now was quickly disappearing.
</p>
<p>
	"That magical BITCH!" CHic pea yelled. "HEY GUYS I THINK AXE...." but it was too late. A beam above her had already given way and landed right on Chic Peas little gnome noggin. She too fell to the floor out cold.
</p>
<p>
	"Just you and me now...BUDDY" Gunk said as he got in between Ruby and Sid. Ruby ran up to Gunk and held onto his arm crying as she did. Under her other arm was the QUantum Communicator.
</p>
<p>
	"Wait...thats the" Sid said.
</p>
<p>
	Just then the sound of a lone nose trumpet bellowed on the wind. BRRR BRRRRR BRRRRRRRRR.
</p>
<p>
	Sid and Gunk and Ruby looked up to see a great winged creature silhouted against the bright outside light. There, in all his majesty was,....
</p>
<p>
	"FLYMAN?!" Sid yelled.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh hey guys I...." but before he could finish Flyman vomitted all over the place.
</p>
<p>
	"OH GOD" Gunk yelled. But Ruby was directly under the spew stream. Flyman's acid chunk spew landed on her arm burning her down to the bone. She let out a horrid scream as she dropped the qauantum communicator. As it hit the ground it broke with many seemingly important pieces flying off in all directions.
</p>
<p>
	"FUCKING FLY MOTHER FUCK" Ruby yelled.
</p>
<p>
	"MY LOVE" Gunk ran back over to her and held her. "We have to get out of here"
</p>
<p>
	"Flyman.....YOU ARE THE KING!" Sid said as he saluted Flyman.
</p>
<p>
	"I got air sick flying over here....sorry for all the honkage" Flyman said landing daintily.
</p>
<p>
	As Gunk and Ruby  exited the Temple Ruby looked back at Sid. For a breif second her face transformed like she was some kind of clayface or something. It returned to looking like Axewound. Her eyes lit up with green magical power and as she winked at Sid and then turned back to wince and winge in pain, again looking like Ruby Rubbleborn.
</p>
<p>
	THE END.
</p>
