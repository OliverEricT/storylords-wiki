Ep 39

Incantations and Cooking

When You Die Worms Eat Your Face

 Axewound plummeted down into a lake of fire but her expression was as immovable as her perfect hair. She crossed her arms mid fall and let out a sigh. That little peanut dick goblin ruined EVERYTHING! The bone dragon righted its trajectory and made a dive back for its master barely sailing below her before she hit molten death.

"'Bout time....YOU IDIOT" Axewound scolded as the dragon only lowered its head in shame.

Back at Heck HQ Goblins and Dog/Clog men were hard at work decorating the gymnasium for the return of the Queen.

"Now...no...Gerald it needs to be even. Lets at least look like we have a 3rd grade understanding of the world!" Glut directed Gerald the Dog Man at hanging up a gigantic banner. Gerald shot a short growl at the goblin before rasing the banner a few inches.

"Good! Looks great!" Glut said with approval. He stepped back to admire his handiwork and read the banner aloud quietly to himself.

"MISSION ACCOMPLISHED" it read. Certainly there would be no need for a backup banner that read "WE'LL GET EM NEXT TIME" Glut thought. The Queen was sure to have achieved her goal of making the most powerful axe in all the land. One that would rival the legendary axes of history such as "Axe Body Spray", "Axel Foley", and the infamous "Let me AXE you a question".

BOOM! The main doorway to the outside of the gymnaseum slammed.

"She's here!" Glut whisper yelled. "Places everyone places!". He shoo'd dogmen and goblins to their respective spots for the big surprise. But as Axewound entered she was clearly axeless and wore an angry expression. One even more noticable than her usualy RBF face that oozed 'Don't talk to me' vibes.

"SURPRII" Yelled Gerald but almost immediately his face was met with a magic bolt that turned his face all black like in a cartoon. It also blew off most of his flesh leaving only the open cavity of his upper nasal passage which you don't often see in cartoons.

Axewound looked up angrily at the banner and then scanned the room to see almost everyone of her minions now hiding terrified in their surprise hiding spots.

"Mission Accomplished.....MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!?" She laughed maniacly. "More like MISSION STUPID FAILED BECAUSE ONE OF YOU LITTLE MUD HUMPERS RUINED IT ALL!"

"We...probably couldn't have fit that on a banner...." Glut said quietly in the background.

'aaaaaAAAAAAAHHHH" Axewound let out a rage filled scream as she hurled a firebolt at the banner instantly igniting it like it was soaked in gasoline. That's "petrol" for you Rich. "WhY Do YoU CaLL iT GaS wHeN iTS a LiQuId?!?!?!?" I don't know. Why does yo mama call my dick "King Richard the 69th" when King Charles is the king now? 

Axewound's rage was seldom held in check but on this day she really let the beast out of the already unlocked cardboard barred cage. This was like if the prom scene from Carrie fucked the prom scene from Idle Hands and had a baby that was also a prom scene but this wasn't a prom but it looked like this.

Axewound heaved breath in and out as she clenched her fists to her sides. Shaking she snapped her neck over to one of the only remaining minions she had left alive.

"We need a better caliber of minion around here!" She almost screamed. "You little twig dicked pencil dicked nerd dicks aren't cutting it. Fool me once....not gonna....not gonna fool me again!" she screamed as she stormed out of the gym. As the doors slammed behind her several severed apendages fell to the ground form the cieling in a wet thud.

"Someone's got a case of the moonsdays..." Glut said as he poured himself some grog out of the punch bowl.

"Oh that's good Sethy yes...." Axewound said as 2 Bluecumbers rested on her eyes. Seth was messaging her feet as attendence of all sorts were gliding around her quarters with various lavish mood calming placebos...I mean...herbal remedies.

"When I take these bluecumbers off my eyes I better not see you using your tongue again Seth. We're not that desperate for listeners........YET" Axewound said still enjoying the foot massage.

"BING BONG" a goldish yellow light pierced the cucumbery flesh of her covered eyes as the sound of her all see ball could be heard. Seth immediately stopped his totally consensual and not at all weird or sexual foot massage and left the room to give his queen her privacy. The attendence in the room all scurried to pick up their trays and grapes and wines and exit the room but Axewound stopped them with a single snap of her long fingers.

"You may stay..." She simply said as she rose up and took the vegetables off her dark still angry eyes. They had not done the job that putting cucumbers on your face is supposed to do. At least I dont think? I was never really clear on why people do that. If its because they're mostly water why not just put water on your face. Becuase water is 100% water. But Narrator, I hear you ask. "What do you turn into when you eat them?". Nothing they're just vegetables of a different color. But maybe if you eat one you'll turn into someone who doesn't ask stupid questions.

ANYWAY!

"BING BONG" the all see alarm rang a second time. Axewound hurriedly searched her robes for another all see ball. This was her work all see ball. She held it high above her head as if she were searching for reception and this was 2004. Like...yeah dude your'e gonna get a signal by putting the phone up into the air 2 more feet. Those satalites are fuckin at least 17 miles above us but sure, your puny tiny arms were JUST enough to break through the interference of the entire Earth's atmosphere and probably a shit ton of space debris. You really life hacked your way out of this one, Bill Nye the Stupid Guy.

She pressed a few all see buttons and a visual image of herself appeared. It was a pre-recorded ritual of her in full ritual regalia but only it was being played at 500% speed. The ritual which normally would take hours only took a few minutes. She was like the Cap'n Crunch of Necromancers. 

"These things really did change the way we necromance" She thought to herself. As the recorded ritual ended all the attendence in the room froze in place. One girl, a human girl, tried to move her feet but was frozen to the ground. She tried to scream but her mouth was sealed shut. The dull gutteral moan of her terror was muted by her own mouth. Soon all the attendence in the room began to 'yell" and cry through gritted teeth and closed mouths. The first girl looked down at her frozen to the ground foot and noticed a black set of clawed hands holding them in place. Her eyes widened as fear probably caushed her to piss pants but its entirely possible that the ritual had frozen all bladders as well. 

She let out another muffled scream as the hand stretched upward into a hand and now an arm. And then the tearing began.

Each hand began to tear the flesh off of the legs of the attendants in the room. The screams would have filled the very halls of Heck if they weren't muffled. Axewound sat bopping up and down with all see phones in her ears as she listeneed to Steal My Sunshine by Len. It was on her "Rituals and Beach" mix she had made 3 summers ago.

When the black hands had made their way far enough up to tear the meat from the faces of their victims most had already died of fear and/or lack of meat on your body. A troublingly frequent cause of death whenever Axewound was around.

In a sudden burst of white light the hands illuminated into a single ball of magical energy and zooped straight toward the special all see ball sitting on a pedastal in a place of esteem in her quarters. Right next to her Hitachi.

"oop" she said as he realized the ritual was nearly complete. Why work hard when you can work more EVILLY she thought to herself.

On the all see ball a black image of a standard looking male humanoid appeared.

"Little Princesssssss..." it trailed off as if it was not completely whole.

"My Lord" Axewound bowed as reverently as she could muster.

"How goes my plans for this realm?" the voice boomed.

 "So far not great my lord...the quality of minion in this time period is severely lacking. Just today had to kill 2/3rds of my minions for the failure of one minion who's name WE SHALL NOT BE REPEATING!" Axewound seethed.

"And the axe?" the figure axed.

"Lost." Axewound responded curtly.

"You will need all the help you can get in order to stand against those who would stop us. They are gathering their resources and allies. You must do the same. You need Cold Steel as they will be weilding it against us. And you need those you can..."

"Trust?" Axewound interrupted.

"You cannot trust anyone. You need those you can sacrifice in the most strategic and efficient way. Like in chess. So I'm told I'm more of a Hungry Hungry Hippogriphs fan...." the figure said evilly as fuck. "Seek those who are prone to corruption and degeneracy. Those who's will is bent toward the dark. You know...people into Hentai and shit I dont know...." 

"Hmmmm..." Axewound tapped her chin. "Who is the most manipulatable and degenerate type of being that makes up most of Heck's population....." 

"Storylords fans..." said the image only to be cut off by Axewound shouting "ROCK STARS!"

"Yes...yes that is....also what I was saying good....GOOOOOD....." the image began to fade away slowly.

"We'll have a battle of the bands to find the MOST EVIL and degenerate minions in all of Daranos!" Axewound said excitedly.

The image of the dark figure slowly reformed.

"You're not...you're not just using this as an excuse to throw another party are you?" It asked.

"Whaaaaaaat?" Axewound said innocently. "Nahhh no I would never."

"Good because I will be out of town for a few eons and when I come back you better have an army of darkness ready to conquer this realm or so help me I'll find another Princess or whatever to do that stuff with....."

"Sure sure yeah got it....no parties just work...." Axewound smiled at the figure.

"Hmmmm" it grumbled as it faded back to wherever it came from.

"PARTY TIME!!!!" Axewound yelled making sure the all see ball of off.

"SIRE SIRE!" A small halfling yelled running through the halls of an enormous mansion. Even being a halfling he was dwarfed by the pillars of marble and the sheer immensity of this hall. Can I say dwarfed when talking about a halfling? I'm sure I'll find out!

"What is it Cheese-Dick" Axel the Dragon sighed as he played on an enormous unplugged Gibson Flying V.

"Uhhh its Cheldric. Your agent? Cheldric?" the halfling shouted up at the dragon.

"Cheese-DIck I dont have all day. I have a hot date later with Anna the Arm-Ass. Wanna know why they named her that, Cheese-Dick" Axel said with a wink.

"Sire...you must turn on MT-AllSee!" Cheldric said as he hefted up a giant all see remote.

"Kurt Choder here reporting on the latest news and references from 30 years ago...."

Axel half heartedly noodled Kiss Me by Sixpence None the Richer on his guitar as he other half heartidly paid attention to the all see ball.

"Queen of Heck and Necromantic Pin Up Fantasy Princess Axewound has just annnounced the return of Heck's battle of the bands. Acts such as Megan Thee Stallion, Dashboard Cornfessional, and a definitely deceased Lou Bega have already signed up. The prize is suspiciously being kept a secret in this giant box with a ribbon and question mark on it. It could literally be anything that fits inside of a box this size. Or perhaps the box is a metaphor in which case I guess the prize could be anything you could imagine...as long as your imagination is bigger than this box."

"PASS" Axel said flippantly.

"But SIRE!??" Cheese-Dick pleaded.

"No word yet on whether Darnos's hardest most gut punching metal bands, Wife Bones, will be attendence after rumors of a breakup. When asked if she thought Wife Bones could possibly play Princess Axewound simply said 'Those Old Chode Chuggers?' and then laughed as she walked away and did the Cut It Out motion that Uncle Joey did on Full House."

Axel stopped mid riff as the neck of hte guitar began to crack and splinter.

"SHE DID THE CUT IT OUT FROM UNCLE JOEY!?!?!?!" he screamed as fire belched from his facial orifices.

"I've been trying to tell you sire...we must get on top of this....do some PR damage control" Cheldric groveled.

"The only PR I'm interested in doing right now is PERFORATING SOME RECTUMS!" Axel screamed. "We're gonna play. And not only are we gonna play but we're gonna win. We. Are. WIFE BONES! I didn't name this band after the bones of my dead wife's carcass not to be crowned the most metal, hot has heck fire, band in all of Daranos."

"Very good sire" Cheldric bowed.

The gynmasium of Heck had been cleaned of any and all visible remains human and otherwise for this most historic of parties...I mean....minion finding battle of the bands.

Axewound herself sat atop a throne wearing a crown of bones. She rocked back and forth to the various bands who were playing just ot make a name for themselves. Maybe one day they'll tell their grandkids they played in a gymnaseum in Heck. That'll be interesting to a group of gen alphas more interested in Roblox bux than they are in the world around them.

"Lou Bega is up next your highness" Glut said to Axewound. As he walked on stage looking very much alive Axewound held out her hands in the "WTF" position.

"I thought this dude was dead, Glut. What the shit gives? How'd he even get in?" Axewound asked.

"How did he NOT get in, my queen" Glut said as Mambo Number Five had everyone in the gym mambo-ing number 69. This was going to hard to beat. And with Lou Bega at her side she could take over Daranos through pure musical genius alone. Nobody would know what hit them.

Suddenly the back wall of the gymnaseum exploded into a tidal wave of wood, stone, and those tan bricks they build every high school out of. Debris covered Lou Bega and burried him alive presumably crushing him to death finally putting to rest the debate of whether or not he's dead or not. Even a small puddle of Lou Blood leaked out from under the rubble as a gigantic reptillian foot stomped down on it and began to tap in time.

"We're WIFE BONES AND FUCK THIS WHOLE STUPID PARTY" Shouted Axel. "1, 2, 3,4" and then Wife Bones played the most epic come back song ever to ever cum on someones back.

When you're dead worms eat your face

Just do whatever you want when you're awake

Because when you're dead worms eat your face

Nothing matters, not time not space

Worms will eat your face when you leave this place

If yuou don't like worms thats too bad

because its only worms that will eat your face and head.

The strings of Axel's Flying V were vibrating at such a metalic speed that each one began to glow red hot with sheer rocktacular power. An orc in the audience screamed "I LOVE YOU AXEL" as she busted open her Tunic Tube Top to reveal her six enormous totally real mommery glands. One of them had a tattoo on it in black speech that said "Thanks for the Mammories with a cool S" it said "with a cool S" the cool S wasn't there it just said that next to the other thing it said.

Droc Stormrage, WIfe Bones' Kobold drummer was double bass pedalling so fast that the vibrations and groove blew the skirts up on everyone within a 2 mile radius. It was said to have even cured the erectile disfunction of those who had it....or ....so I"M TOLD! A friend told me. 

Quag, the band's roadie ran out to replace Axel's legendary guitar picks made out of the toe nails of his slain victims. As he did he held up his hands near Axel's pilckups on his guitar and mimed like they were warming his hands but instead the sheer volume and power of Axel's playing actually began to sear the flesh from Quag's bones.

"Oh he COOKIN" said Glut as his tunic blew up from the drums bass. Everone directly upwind died and had to have a closed casket funeral.

Somewere deep in the woods a Mirkmonk awoke to the sounds of probably the greatest comeback in musical history being played

"Son of  BITCH" he yelled under his breath as to not wake up his beautiful mirkmonk wife.

As he stormed out into his living room he saw the glow of an all see ball. 

"What is all this racket!?" He said to his young mirkmonk son.

"Oh sorry dad...just watching Live Hate on the ole See Boob Tube" he said turning down the volume.

"That's ok son...just make sure you get some sleep. We have a long day tomorrow" He said as he kissed his son's head.

"I love you dad" 

"I love you too son"

As the 69 minute guitar solo came to an end the first few rows of spectators had been incinerated into pure ash. Those unlucky enough to get 4th or 5th row seats would not have the luxury of a quick death. The dust and debris from all the vaporized bodies and architecutre would give them lung problems akin to Gulf War Syndrome. They'd all be dead within the year. Those behind them were in what was called "The Splash Zone" due to the amount of 3ing that was going on, spontaneously or otherwise. Wife Bones made your girlfriend wetter than the Sahara during the Holocene era. Which is a shirt you could buy at the shirt vendor for 20 Daranos Bucks or for each of your big toe's nails.

After their one and only song which took about 3 hours to play silence fell over the crowld. Those that were left alive anyway. Clap.....clap......clap.....a slow clap came from the throne of Axewound. It echoed through the silent gymnaseum which was a quiet as a tomb as it was also a literal tomb for so many who were lucky enough to see this come back show.

"I think we have a winner..." Axewound shouted as she rose her hands. Every survivor began to scream and cheer.

"We don't care about that kind of shit" Axel roared as he slid his pick down the guitar's neck which somehow played a solo on its own so beautiful it caused anyone who heard it to stop dead in their tracks and wheep in awe.

"But...don't you want to see whats in the box!?" Axewound yelled as she goaded the crowd into another roar.

"WHATS IN THE BOX?!?!" Cried a kobold form the background.

WIth a snap of her fingers the sides of the box fell apart revealing a golden ring. A huge golden ring.

"A COCK RING!??!" Said the What's in teh Box Kobold.

"Its a collar you frickin ass licking moron" Axewound said then cleared her throat. "I want to....sign Wife Bones...to an...exclusive deal"

"Pass" Axel said immediately. "We aren't sell outs. We don't 'SIGN' with anyone. Music belongs to the masses. Plus with All See Balls you can just listen to whatever you want whenever anyway so why even sign with anyone?"

"Because if you don't I'll kill every single one of you" Axewound smiled.

"I'm already dead inside lady. Not much left for you to kill" Axel said smiling back.

"Then we're more alike than you know. I too don't give a shit about anyone or anything. In fact...I'm going to be honest with you. I staged this party in order to get close to you. I think you and I could do some wonderfully terrible things."

"I already told you toots" Axel spit on the ground a ball of fire. "I don't sell out"

"Think of it as BUYING IN" she said persistantly.

"Read my dick sucking tit licking lips.PAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSS" 

"Ugh fine we'll do it this way then." Axewound again snapped her fingers as a hoard of kobolds and goblins began to pour from each fire exit.

Axel laughed at the shear futility of their deaths as he roasted wave after wave of now sizzling and delicious smelling minions.

"I can do this all day honey" Axel shouted over the screams of roasted minion.

"Maybe...." Axewound said as she checked her nails. "But down here big boy I'm in charge!" She held out her perfectly manicured fingers and etched profane runes in the air. One of them was the cool S. This time it was the cool S not just the words "it was the cool S".

Time began to slow as Axel felt the tug of ages pull at him. He slowly glanced toward Quag and Droc to see them aging rappidly. Usually this life lead to short life spans but being a dragon had saved Axel form that pain. Not so lucky for Droc and Quag who were aging to dust right in front of him. As this was going on the waves and waves of minions covered Axel's body. He was going to slow to move them or do anything about them. One grabbed the giant collar and clamped it down onto Axel's neck. The peripherals of his vision began to darken. The last thing he saw were the ravages of time reducing his band to desicated husks as worms began to eat their faces.

"I......told......you!" were the last words he could utter.

FIN
