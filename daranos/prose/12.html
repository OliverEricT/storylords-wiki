	Merry Crumbus to All and to All a Death Night
</p>
<p>
	Daranos is home to some of the most majestic and landscapes and vistas this side of the 3 Universes. From the Peaks of Mount Buttsmore to the giant forests of Maroonpine trees in Dalifornia the sights one could see are only  limited by the person or, some say, genious God who created them. I bet he's a handsome god too. Like a New York 12 on a bad day. And his peener  oh my god I bet its thats as long as a Daranos baker's dozen which is actually 14 because 13 is a weird odd number and I am superstitious as all fuck.
</p>
<p>
	But not all of Big D is majestic or nice or moderately pleasant or habitable in any sense of the term. Southern Daranos is such a place. Sure there's the Cat desert where the Cat People come from because geographically that would make sense from a lore standpoint but until someone pays for...I MEAN wants to make a map of Daranos we're not going to worry about that. Southern Daranos is also home to the DEEP SWAMP. A swamp so backward and desolate that only a truly stubborn and uneducated people would be able to eek out a meager living in a place that not only smells like a rotten foot but that, a rottten foot, is also their state bird.
</p>
<p>
	"CRUMBUS GET IN HERE!" Yelled Britania Spears to her husband from inside of their mud hut.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah yeah keep yer ratty ass shabby rags on IMMA COMIN" Crumbus yelled back. The 6 foot tall Troll was a proud dirt farmer in these parts and as he whiped his brow of sweat he lowered a rickety wheel barrow full of fresh clean dirt. Brown gold they called it.
</p>
<p>
	As Crumbus entered his  hut he could barely hear himself over the cacophonous sound of his 2 children Killy and Brud fighting over the all see ball.
</p>
<p>
	"ITS MY TURN TO WATCH FLAMINGO DYNASTY" yelled Brud wrenching the ball away from his sister.
</p>
<p>
	"THEMS NOT EVEN REAL BIRDS" Killy said as she tugged back.
</p>
<p>
	"Crumubus. Did you get the children their Orcsmas presents yet?" Brittania Spears questioned her husband squinting her eyes already knowing the answer.
</p>
<p>
	"As soon as this dirt harvest comes in Brit I'mma go buy them each new tattered rags and pick up the new Bonecar Oil catalogue for Brud."
</p>
<p>
	"Crumbus you say that every year and every year you forget to buy our own flesh and blood Orcsmas presesnts and I'm tired of being the only hillbilly stereotypes 'round these parts to fullfill each and every steroetype of a backward uneducated disenfranchised peoples every dang year!" Britania finished fanning herself like southern ladies do for some reason.
</p>
<p>
	"I'll think of something Brit. I promise this Orscmas is gonna be different." 
</p>
<p>
	"FINE TAKE IT" Brud said finally relenting the all see ball. This caused Kelly to jump up and down in her tube top which made the audience go "WOOOOO" and do wolf howls because that was a thing that was on real TV once and everyone just went with it so I'm pretty sure I can write a story about trolls who fuck within their own gene pool.
</p>
<p>
	As the days rolled on life remained pretty much the same for the dirt farming Spears family.  The dirt harvest came in and Crumbus still hadn't figured out how he was going to give his children the Orcsmas they deserved. He sat on his Throne of Bones reclyner and looked pu at the mantle where the family coat of arms hung for generations. The coat was just an oroboros but instead of snakes eating their own tails it was of scaled dicks going into vageeners. It symbolized the Spears family tree which was just a circle. A genetic sesspool that was filthier than those little kid pools at public pools that are really warm and you can't tell if its because the water is shallow and the hot summer sun is heating it up or if the pool is just that filled with hot child piss but the thought of it makes you gag fuck that I ain't going near that shit.
</p>
<p>
	"I got it...." Crumbus whispered to himself. "I GOT IT. BRIT GET IN HERE I FIGURED IT OUT"
</p>
<p>
	Brit came slowly into the room still fanning herself. "Crumbus what is you shoutin at in here?" She demanded to know.
</p>
<p>
	"I know how to save Orcsmas!" he yelled as he shook her shoulders. "I have to find the NAGA QUEEN" he yelled looking around the room for his cloak.
</p>
<p>
	"Crumbus honey that is just a myth, its not real like the stories in the Daranosian Superstition Codex that are definitely true and real, Amen" 
</p>
<p>
	"The Naga queen is said to have the  abiltiy to grant you super powers...err...magic powers yeah thats the theme of othis segment...MAGIC  POWERS that I can use to magic us the best Orcsmas we've ever had!" Crumub said doing a magic hand wave and making a sound like a whoosh.
</p>
<p>
	"Crumbus this is stupid ur stupid" Brit finally said turning around to go back to the kitchen or wherever troll hillbilies stereotypically went if they were female. But this did not stop Crumbus from soliloquy-ing. Brud and Killy sat on the throne couch with ear horns on listening to the all see ball staring lifelessly at it.
</p>
<p>
	"It's like my mama who is also my aunt who is also my cousin who is also my step sister who is also my great aunt who is also my godmother who is also my mechanic always said she said 'BOYS PULL URSELF UP BY YOUR BOOBSTRAPS BECAUSE MAMA AINT GONNA ALWAYS  BE AROUND FOR YOU TO SUCK ON HER TITTIES YOU HAVE TO GROW UP AND TAKE MATTERS INTO YOUR OWN HANDS UNTIL THE TIME YOU REACH ADULTHOOD IN WHICH CASE YOU CAN GO BACK TO FONDLING MY HANGERS BECAUSE..." then she trailed off and gestured to the family coat of arms".
</p>
<p>
	Crumbus was now frantically packing a satchel full of goods for his journey and also an old TV Guide with Alf on it for some reason.
</p>
<p>
	"This is gonna be the greatest adventure since General Lee started the Civil War at Gettysburg" he proclaimed to nobody because they weren't listening.
</p>
<p>
	"General Lee the orange bone car of course. Yep he single handedly ran down 3 Demoncrats at the Getty station sparking Daranos' first and least known civil war. You know the one Hun, the Getty station down near the BP station 'BP for when you aboslulty need that BASILISK POWER'" he finished as he was now reciting the ads for BP he had seen on the all see balls they have at the mana pumps for some reason. Like am I supposed to be watching this shit I'm just here to get gas I mean MANA for my bonecar. Can't even do that without being inundated with capitalisms absolute shameless greed.
</p>
<p>
	As Crumbus exited the hut he looked back for one last glance at the only home he's ever known not counting that stint in the village jail he served for what the county called "Tusk Perversions" whatever that is. THANKS DEMONCRATS!
</p>
<p>
	"Goodbye my beloved family" he whispered to himself as a single tear ran down his perverted tusk.
</p>
<p>
	"NOBODY CARES" Brud  yelled from inside.
</p>
<p>
	Along the way Crumbus found some batlpes and put them in his bag. If all else failed he could give them to his kids for a nice Orcsmas meal and hopefully turn them into chairs so he could easily skip townn and start a new life a circus troll who got shot out of the blunderbus.
</p>
<p>
	Soon he heard the clip clopping of horse hooves and quickly ducked behind a fell tree. He peered his good seein eye out of a knot in the wood of the tree and waited for the horse to pass. Was it a knight? Was it a Werehorse come to find and turn him into a Werehorse because thats totally thing add it to the bestiary.
</p>
<p>
	"It's alright traveler" a soothing and pleasant voice said. "You can come out I won't  hurt you"
</p>
<p>
	Crumbus slowly raised his eyes above the tree and saw THE MOST BEAUTIFUL centaur he had ever seen. Her dark skin shimmered with glittery magic. Her hair was as dark as the murky swamps. She was topless and had huge mammories.
</p>
<p>
	"Who...who is you" Crumbus stumbled over himself with his jaw agape.
</p>
<p>
	"My name is Megan Thee Stallion" she said as she clip clopped closer to Crumbus "I am a local healer and bard. My magical raps have cured thousands. I have the voice of an angel having an orgasm during an orgy choir recital" she said humbly.
</p>
<p>
	"My names Crumbus and I'm lookin for the Queen of the Naga" he said matter of factly.
</p>
<p>
	"You must not look for her Crumb" Megan said leaning down closer to his face. "For she is a deciever and a THOT. She will take everything from you" 
</p>
<p>
	"Ok but I heard she could give you super powers so I'm gonna just  try that anyway no offense" 
</p>
<p>
	Megan sighed. "Fine do whatever you want I'm not your mama who is who is also your aunt who is also your  cousin who is also your  step sister who is also your great aunt who is also your godmother who is also my mechanic"
</p>
<p>
	With that Megan thee Stallion trotted off lookin real sexy and thiccc with three c's. Like I'm so horny for her I could fuck a horse if you know what I'm saying. I'd fuck Megan Thee Stallion even if she had a  horse lower body is what I'm saying.
</p>
<p>
	Soon Crumbus arrived at the dankest part of the swamp forest. The trees were covered in that moss that loooks like spider webs. There were also lots of spider webs. Before him stood a pool of the blackest thickest muddy water he had ever seen and this dude farmed DIRT for living. The swamp was still and there were no animals round. Not even bugs. Do you know how fuckin creepy a swamp has to be for there to be ZERO bugs around it? You'd piss your rags.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly as Crumbus aproached the shore of the swamp the water began to rumble and churn. The water stirred and swirled like the worlds nastiest hot tub after an orgy recital. Out from the torrent of muck and grime slid a two headed snake beast. It's heads turned around each other as it slithered its way out of the grime. It's skin was irredescent purple. It's 4 eyes glowed purple in the dark. It's hisses filled the still but  humid night air. It writhed its ophidian body around and around itself trying to gain purchase on something it could perch itself onto. Crumb stood there in awe. Mostly because, YUP you guessed it the Naga Queens reptilian milkers were just hanging out. Each time it wrapped its body around Crumb could catch of glimpse of the reptilian BAPS like this was a Saturday Night and he was watching blurry Channel 99 Pay Per View.
</p>
<p>
	"What do ssssyou want mortalllllllllssssss" The first head spoke.
</p>
<p>
	"Excuse me Queen sir" Crumb said "I did done hear you were giving out magical super powers and I thought why hell that'd be nice to have" 
</p>
<p>
	"You wishssssss to gain powerssssssss?" the second head hissed.
</p>
<p>
	"Yes ma'am and maybe like one of those magical freeze boxes for my Natty Ice Potions for the barn ya know? I sure do love me some Natty Ice Potion warm but I figured I've never had a cold drink of anything in my life so hell why not drink cold piss swill instead of warm piss swill know what I mean?"
</p>
<p>
	"We doooosssss" the heads said together. "You must choooooossssse" the first head spoke again.
</p>
<p>
	"Choose what?" Crumb said still thinking about the magical ice box.
</p>
<p>
	"Choooooose which of ussssss will grant you the giiiiiffft" The  second head said.
</p>
<p>
	"Ohhhh I get it" Crumb said rubbing his chin. "I dont get it"
</p>
<p>
	"One of us will grant you magggggiiiiksssssss the other....will grant you the kisssssss of death. You mussssst chooooossseee which of us will biiite you and ssssset you freeeeee" one of heads said I'm not going to keep saying which one its getting boring.
</p>
<p>
	"Alright" Crumb said. "But how do I know which one is which?"
</p>
<p>
	"You doooon't" said the Queen. "But you may ask us any questions you wissssshhhh"
</p>
<p>
	"Ok sso....OK I got a question. Which one of you grants the magic wish powers?" Crumb said smuggly. He did it. He outsmarted the Queen of Deception herself.
</p>
<p>
	"Niiiiiccccce try but we do not know which of ussssss is whicchhhh. The moons change ussssss every night and we ourselves never know which of us is cursed"
</p>
<p>
	Crumbus hummed and scratched his head. "Well shoot. Were there any other fellers over here today trynna get Orscmas saving powers?"
</p>
<p>
	"Noooooo" hissed the Queen
</p>
<p>
	"Are yall lying to me?" 
</p>
<p>
	"Nooooo?"
</p>
<p>
	The 3 sat in silence for a beat until
</p>
<p>
	"Oh I got another question for yall. Yall ever seen them Monster Bonetrucks? HOOOOO EEEE those are a hoot. How do they get into those things? Some kind of teleport spell or maybe they have big legs but then how do they fit them inside the cab? I'll tell ya what though I took Brud to see them down at the Pizza Dome last year and  we got to see the world record for mosts  bystanders killed by a single truck HOT DOG what a show"
</p>
<p>
	"ANY MORREEEE QUESTTTIOONNSSSS pertaining to your choiiiiccccce" the Queen snapped back.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh oh yeah hell yeah" Crumb said. "Who is the best Nasbonecar driver of all time?"
</p>
<p>
	"Snail Wormheart" the  first head said without missing a beat.
</p>
<p>
	"HOT DAMN YOU I CHOOSE YOU THE LEFT ONE HOOOO YEEEEE"
</p>
<p>
	"You mean the riiiight one?" asked the second head
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah I picked the right one the left one" Crumb said clarifyingly.
</p>
<p>
	"Waaait" hisssed the Queen. "Our left or your left"
</p>
<p>
	"Who's on first?" 
</p>
<p>
	"You knowwhaaaaat. It doooeeesssn't mattter." hissed the first queen head as she drew back and swiftly struck Crumb in the neck injecting him with a purple viscous venom that course through his veins.
</p>
<p>
	"Now go hoooome to your meger liiiiife and wait one full rotation of the moons and  you will be set freeeeee" The queen began laughing and laughing as she sank back into the murky swamp.
</p>
<p>
	Soon Crumb began the long journy back to his family. The trip was going to take a little longer than one day so he figured he could spend that time practicing his magic and making cool presents or doing sick magic tricks. As the day wore on he began to feel....not good. As the next night arrived Crumb was full blown fucked up. If this was how magic felt wizards must be some fuckin sadistic fucks.
</p>
<p>
	Again Crumb heard the clip clop of a steed. Just as the noise rounded a bend in the trees he saw Megan Thee Stalliion for the briefest glimpse then fell over unconcious.
</p>
<p>
	"You DUMB MOTHER FUCK" Megan said. "I TOLD YOUR ASS NOT TO GO DO THAT FUCKIN SWAMP" She sighed as she picked his shivvering body up. Sweat drenched his tattered rags. 
</p>
<p>
	"EW" she said. "Lets get you to an apothocary" She smacked her own juicy booty, made the Aleyia baby sound and off they went. 
</p>
<p>
	Megan burst through the door of the nearest apothocary and laid Crumbs body down on the table. "He's got Naga Queen venom in his body ody body ody body ody body ody EH" she yelled.
</p>
<p>
	"Nothin I can do about that" The old apothocary grumbled as he blew smoke out of his pipe and and made a skull and crossbones. "It's up to him now"
</p>
<p>
	Megan fetched water and a bucket and began to cool off Crumbs forehead. He seemed to be alternating between extreme fever and extreme anti fever. He shivered so hard one of his teeth cracked. Then he began sweating so much it looked like his pits pissed themselves.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly a dark cloaked figure entered the room. It slid across the ground and made no sound. It's cloak was not made of any fabric known to man or wizard. It was like smoke. Megan and the Old Man paid it no mind as it sidled up next to Crumbus. It was mere inches from Megan's face as it lowered its cloaked face down toward Crumb's. Still Megan seemed not to notice but for a cold shiver that ran up her spine. She shuttered and looked around to see that the door was open and went to close it.
</p>
<p>
	The figure slowly lowered itself farther down. As it did it removed its hood to reveal a half of  a skull with no lower jaw. Smoke billowed out of its eye sockets and from out of its face hole where a jaw should have been. It breathed deeply and rang a bony finger down Crumbs' forehead. Crumb winced in pain and screamed in agony. The cloaked figure laughed. It laughed a laugh only heard in hell. If you or I were to ever hear this laugh it surely would be the last things we ever heard with mortal ears. 
</p>
<p>
	Crumb awoke on top of a mountain. There was snow everywhere. He assumed it was snow since he had  never actually seen snow. In the distance was a cloaked figure billowing its cloak all over the dang place.
</p>
<p>
	"Hey uh....Are you my magical superviser or somethin" he yelled toward the figure. The  cloak floated across the snow as wind howeled alla round it. As it moved through the falling snow the snow itself gave way to it. Below there were  no footprints.
</p>
<p>
	"ohhhh shooooooot" Crumb said coming to the realization that this wasn't his magical supervisor whatever that was.
</p>
<p>
	"You're death!" he said backing away. The figure lifted a hand and began to point at Crumbus. As it did it continued its motion to remove its hood. Crumb shut his eyes hard hoping this was like Raiders of the Lost Ark rules then finally Death removed its hood.
</p>
<p>
	"Hello yes hi I am Reaper #69420247" The figure said.
</p>
<p>
	"D...Death?" Crumb winced.
</p>
<p>
	"No....REAPER #69420247" he repeated. "What do you think death is like some Santa Clause character that flies around single handedly killing people? Do you know how many people die each day? Especially in this fackakta place. I just had to pull a guy out of a gelatanous cube because he tried to stick his pecker in it. This place is crazy"
</p>
<p>
	"So...I'm not going to die YEEE HAW" Crumb shouted.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh no my boy you are most certainly going to die. Whether that is today well...that is yet to be determined" The Reaper waved  his hands. Out from his his cloak he procured a large hour glass the sand inside of which glowed a bright blue. As it fell to the bottom half the color turned a dull brown.
</p>
<p>
	"Ok here's the deal you climb this mountain  and reach the peak and you find your heroes journey and you learn a lesson yada yada yada. You have until this here hour glass expires. I suggest you go there's trials and all that nonsense."
</p>
<p>
	Crumbus watched as grains of sand fell and seemingly died. He looked up to the mountain and heard a roar.
</p>
<p>
	"SHOOOT NO" he said.
</p>
<p>
	"You must go. Learn your lesson about how your family is the real gift or whatever the hell your lesson is. I"ll be down here if you need any help just call my all see ball the numbers 1-800-Figure It Out Yourself." The reaper lit a cigarette and puffed on it. It somehow stayed in his "mouth" even though he had  no lower jaw.
</p>
<p>
	Crumb turned and began to head up the path to the peak. He soon reached a perch where he heard a roar so loud it would have made his skin melt off if he hadn't been in some kind of coma or DREAM (DING bell rings)
</p>
<p>
	"Awww c'mon" Crumb shouted back down the pass. "Yall couldn't at least start me out with some like Dogmen or some kind of scary endless pit or something? You gotta start me out with a dragon!?"
</p>
<p>
	The Reaper puffed his cig and lifted up his middle finger "Yeah yeah ya yutz"
</p>
<p>
	"I AM THE DRAGON OF TEMPTATION" the dragon bellowed. It drew it's enomours head back and began to inhale. Crumb cowered in fear and  pissed pants a little even in his dream. The dragon let out a monstrous roar as it shot not fire but ice out of its gapinig mouth hole. Crumb readied  himself for the end...but it didn't come. The dragon fired his ice beam to a nearby rock wall. As the ice crystilized and hardened into place Crumb could see dozens and dozens of icy cold potions that said Natty Ice in runic. Crumb gasped and  a single tear fell down his sick degenerate tusks.
</p>
<p>
	"COME MORTAL DRINK OF THE NECTER OF THE GODS" the dragon said witihout a  hint of irony.
</p>
<p>
	Soon Crum and the dragon were getting absolutely piss faced  fall down the steps forget to shit in the toilet drunk on the worst gods forsaken abomination of urinary swill ever invented in the  3 realms.
</p>
<p>
	Megan and the Old Man begane to slap Crumb in the vein  hope he'd wake up and somehow be saved from his fate.
</p>
<p>
	"WAKE UP YOU YOKLE AS FUCK" she yelled. As she held up her hand for another strike the old man caught it and held it. He looked her in her beautiful eyes and just shook his head. 
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly Crumb began to convulse. Frothy discharge spewed from his mouth. He wretched and began to stutter like he was being electricuted.
</p>
<p>
	"FIGHT IT" Yelled Megan cheering him on.
</p>
<p>
	Crumb stopped moving. There was silence. Suddenly the air began to chill. Behind them a blue hazing apirition began to form. Out of the haze Megan could see a tusk...then another. 
</p>
<p>
	"Well SHIT GUESS I"M A GHOST NOW DOG GONNT" Crumb said as he threw his hat down and kicked the dirt like a hillbilly idiot.
</p>
<p>
	FIN
</p>
