Pacts and Sacrifices


EP 23

Forget It Sid. It's Graaltown 


The nights in Daranos are darker than me trying to explain my relationship with my father while I'm on a date with what would later turn out to be my 3rd cousin. Sure if this were Game of Thrones everyone would be all "NICE" and "Thats so hot", but it isn't. This is real dark ass life. Awkward and painful until the day they atomize my molecules into dirt and dust. Just like night time in Daranos.

"Where's my sister, Sid?" Fred asked again more sternly this time.

"How should I know. She's probably on a walkabout like in Crocodildo Cumdee 2 our favorite porn to watch together or something" 

"Ew" Fred said imagining the image now because how could you not? Also this universe is SORT OF LIKE Game of Thrones. There isn't incest though. Unless...Unless thats something that you guys want and it brings in more patrons....?

"She went off on a mission to figure out what the hell is going on in this crazy mixed up non incestuous yet rated M for Mature work a day world" Sid finally relented.

Duncan clicked his pistol into "unshoot mode" and holstered it.

"We just came form Graal. Place is fucked." He said as he grabbed a leg of Turkeymite off of the fire it had been cooking on. Turkeymites are like turkeys but they have 6 legs and once you get the through the hard outer shell they are pretty good. They taste like chicken.

"What do you mean 'place is fucked'" Sid gave him a sideways glance.

"Place is fucked and probably haunted or something I don't know. All I know is we can't go back. The mayor has taken over and is using the paladins as is own personal army." Duncan went on. 

"Just like my ex wife" Flyman said with no context whatsoever.


"Anyway..." Sid began. "We need to go back there."

"Why?" Gunk said. "Place is haunted and fucked like Duncan said. Ain't  nothing worth goinog back for anyway."

"Fred what about your parents?" Sid asked his long time friend.

"Well my mom is in portal world in between realities that is probably more pleasant than the current nightmare the real world has become and my dad honestly kind of deserves to be inside of a living nightmare for awhile so...."  He finished with a shrug.

"I told Ugla I'd meet her back there when she was ready to..."Sid stopped himself. "When she was done with her mission. Besides Graal is our home guys. I'm assuming its these dorks' home too. Shooty Guy? Buff Dwarf? Baby Cosplay Twins? YOu're from Graal right?"


"Uhhh yeah" Chic Pea spoke for them all.

"And you guys hate P.O.D.s right?" Sid nudged Buff Dwarf.

"YES" Gunk shouted raising his stein.

"Ugla was right" Sid said. "Something is going on in this realm. Sure Graal is a sesspit of corruption and herpes but ITS OUR HOME!"


Duncan rolled his eyes

"Sure Graal has been on a downward spiral ever since the Giggle Dirt Wars and sure one time I saw a guy taking a huge dump in the middle of North Broad Street BUT ITS OUR HOME GOD FUCKING DAMMIT"

"YES" Gunk yelled again. "Wait we have a NORTH Broad street?"


"Uh yeah its in between Slut Street and Hoochie Mama Street. Up in the Sex For Gold district" Chic Pea clarified.

"The sex with gold district is in the southern reaches" Fred said

"No the SEX FOR GOLD district its different" Peppercorn clarified again.

"HEH Broad street" Gunk let out a laugh. "Never got that reference before....because...because there's broads selling their coo"


"And who's gonna lead this suicide mission" Duncan cut in.

"Don't even think about me leading it. I can't even tie my own moccassins" Flyman said sadly.

Everyone looked over at him in silence.

"It's ok buddy we know" Sid said patting him on the back.

"I'm no leader" Sid said. "I'm good at killing and fucking and sometimes both one after another in that order"


"EW" chic pea said.

"Besides" Sid went on. "This is your crew. I've known Fred for a long time and if he trusts you guys I guess I do." Sid patted Fred on the back as he stood up.

"He's right. We have to at least try to free Graal. Or at very least take a few of those Paladins out. I am so HORNY for violence against them I can taste the cum in the back of my throat. Like I used a cumsauce for my steaks."

"Wow" Chic Pea said. 

"What's the name of this outfit anyway?" Sid questioned.

"THE FLAMINGOS" They all shouted at once raising their steins and turkeymite legs.

"Ok...sure" Sid said. "Well it seems only fitting that the leader of this fine outfit leads us into one last battle." Sid looked over at Duncan who raised his eyes to meet Sid's.

"If you're half as good at killin as  you are convincing I say we have a shot" Duncan said raising  his stein to Sid. "BUT...we're gonna do this my way. And we're gonna be CAREFUL and not STUPID AS ALL FUCK" He finished looking at Gary and Flyman. Gary was already walking around the camp picking flowers out and making a crown while singing the insturmental part from Critney Spear's hit single Toxic.


CUT TO:


The crew all gathered around a map that Duncan had spread out over a tree stump.

"Alright we're gonna need to split into 2 groups" Duncan said addressing everyone. "Me, Gunk, and Fred will storm the POD headquarters Terminator 1 style while Sid, Chic Pea, and uh....That guy" He said pointing to Flyman. "You'll try to make it to the mayor's office and assassinate him"


"Whoa whoa whoa" Gunk began. "We're assasssins now? I thought you'd at least use a euphemism like 'neutralize' or 'destroy' like they do in kids cartoons. I don't know this sounds like a bad idea"

"If it were Game of Thrones everyone would be jacking themselves off into their own mouth's while gargling George RR Fartins chodey ass dick but when we do it its a bridge too far?" Duncan said. "We have to do this. IF Sid is right then everthing is connected. And not like a 'EvErYtHiNg iS CoNnECtEd Maaaaaan' that your uncle started in on at Spanksgiving. Something is wrong we all feel it."


"I've never seen Terminator 1 only Sperminator 1" Flyman admited as he slowly raised his hand as if that was somehow a question?

"Ok" Duncan said rubbing the bridge of his nose. "So in SPERMINATOR does the Sperminator go into a police station of some kind?"


"Oh yeah and he sperminates all of the sexy lady officers if ya know what I mean...." Flyman said almost with pleasure in his voice.


"Ok well instead of 'sperminating' the paladins we're going to....'DESTROY' them" Duncan said looking over at Gunk.

"Thank you" Gunk said with a knod.

"But that's  not your concern anyway. You and Chic Pea along with Sid will be dealing with the Mayor. His office will be heavily fortified with traps and probably pawns that you can easily dspatch. Cut off the head of the snake and the snake will die." Duncan stabbed a knife down into the map for emphasis.

"What about me?" Gary chimed in.

"Uhhhhh" Duncan said looking at Sid. "I honestly thought you were like their pet. I didn't even think you could talk. I at the very most thought you were their servant." 

"GREAT IDEA" Gary said snapping his boning fingers. "I'll be THE BARD on this epic quest." He put on his flower crown and began to noodle on a lute that he pulled out of somewhere....


"Where the hell did he get a lute" Sid asked Flyman.

"I don't even know what is going on in this episode" Flyman said sulking.

"He can help me out in the Bonevan" Peppercorn said. "Come on Skeleton help me put these crystals into the mana engine."


"...THEY FILLED THE TANK SO THEY WOULDN'T STALL ON THEIR WAY TO SAVE ALL OF GRAAAAL" Gary sang strumming his ass lute.

The ride to Graal was quiet. It wasn't like in Predator when Jesse Ventura is listening to Long Tall Sally and then he says that hard F slur because nobody would take some of his nasty ass chewing tobacco. No. This was a somber ride. Nobody was calling anyone innapropriate slurs since each member of the team knew this could be their last mission. And what was it for? Ducnan thought to himself. He was a criminal. Why did Sid's words sway him to act so....unselfishly? Is that evena  word? Duncan shook off the thought blaming it on nerves. 

As the camera panned left Gunk sat with his head lowered and hands on  his axe head while the hilt held them up. Should he have pooped before they left? Nah he'd be fine. Besides he could just shit in the open axe wounds he was going to inflict on the PODs. They deserved far worse. Maybe one would survive only to get some crazy infection that they'd name after Gunk because he had shit in an open wound like a true hero. Yeah....he'd be fine.

The camera moved to Chic Pea. "We're so dead" She thought. "Not me though. They don't let curvy shorties with back meat this die young" She smiled at the thought and blew out a big bubble from her big league chew. See no hard F word. It can be done tastefully.

"Buckle up boys and girls" Fred said from the driver's seat. "We're about to hit a checkpoint"


The crew hustled to get into position. Flyman let out a "Oh dear Dark Lord save me" as he did the Catholic cross yourself thing but instead made a pentagram.


Fred revved the engine and sped the Bone van up to maximum speed. Probably like 4000  acres an hour or something hella fast.

At the checkpoint two idiot paladins were asking travelers for their information and generally being the anti freedom gimps they had become ever since the Mayor took over. Just kidding they've always been like this.

"You hear that?" Said Paladin 1. "Sounds like....." but before he could finish his brains splattered all over the hood of a bonevan going like 4000 acres an hour.

"FUCKIN SHIT WHAT THE FUCK" Paladin 2 screamed as he rushed to alert everyone else and raise the alarm into his Walky Talking Stone. "INTRUDERS SOUTH GATE" he yelled. "BE ALERT"


Just then all of Graal went ape shit sideways. Along the walls of the city Paladins began spraying fire arrows down from every direction.

"You're up Bard" Duncan said. 

"Maestro please would you be so kind" Gary said as Duality from Slipknot began to play. Just then the Staffling gun popped out of the van's sliding side door and Gary began shooting magic bolts like crazy. He turned a paladin into a baby duckly and another he made super small including the guys already tiny peener. That paladin would later try to walk home in his small form and get mugged by a rat with a gun. His orphaned son would not try to avenge him by becoming RAT MAn or something because I bet that paladin was pretty abusive to his family. Look it up. It's like staggering how abusive Cops...I MEAN PALADINS are to their spouses and children.

Just then the van ran over some caltrops that were splayed out over the rough dirt road.

"AH CALTROPS A VANS ONLY WEAKNESS" Sid shouted. Soon the van was leaking mana crystals and limping forward on its momentum only. The crew all ran out of hte van scattering to their assignments.

"Remember" Duncan began.

"I know I know. Kill the snake and the check mate house of cards king me" Sid finished Duncan's thought.

Peppercorn and Gary pushed the gimpy van into an ally and activated its cloaking device which was an actual cloak that was kind of like the Harry Potter cloak but not so hateful against trans people. In fact the only thing visible was the vans "Trans Rights are Human Rights" bumper sticker.

Soon Gunk, Fred, and Duncan reached the front of the POD barracks.

"Where is everyone?" Gunk asked his All See Talky. It's a different brand from teh Walky Talking Stone. Two things can exist at once.

"All PODs are on alert and searching for us throughout the city" Peppercorn said from his command station inside the van. "They're thinned out there's no better time to Sperminator 1 them"

Before Pep could even close the line Gunk was rushing into the barracks with his axe. He screamed a war scream that'd make your mama cum her depends with fear and arousal. That's why she wears depends. It's not because she's old but accidents do happen.

"Can I help yo-" The attendant began to ask Gunk but he lopped off his head before he could finish his passive aggressive government worker apathy laden greeting. Duncan and Fred ran in after Gunk and began shooting and slashing anything that moved and was in a uniform.

Gunk made his way into the barracks inner rooms where perps were being processed. A Paladin was harrassing an Orc that was chained with an old timey ball and chain like  your mama is chained to her responsiblity of raising a failure like you.

"I was watering my FLOWERS!" The orc was pleading with his captor.

"Watering. Flowers. While an Orc" the Paladin wrote down in his little stupid notebook thing.

"OI! LITTLE PIGGY" Gunk yelled. The entire barracks went silent as each and every POD turned in response. Suddenly a bullet flew past Gunk's ear and pierced the POD harrassing the orc right in the dick. Duncan and Fred flew into the office and started going nuts dispatching Paladins. Gunk threw a guy up into a brazier and used a spear to pin him just above it.

"Suspended wiithout pay" Gunk said with a sneer.

Fred was straight up just ripping dudes arms off. He used one Paladins arm as a club to beat his partner to death with then for some reason shoved the arm up the other guy's b hole.


"Mantatory cavity search" He said as the first guy whose arm was ripped off slowly died of massive blood loss.

Duncan shot so many dicks he probably now hold the world record for dick shots. Since he was shooting the dicks off of actual dicks it was like a double dick shoot off. The Mead Book of World Records would record this day as the single greatest dick hunt in all of recorded history.

Soon the barracks were silent. The only sound was the occassional groan of a dying paladin and the drip drip dip of blood and soggy body parts hitting the stone floor. 


"Over here" Fred said gesturing to a room with bars on it. "It's the evidence treasure room"

Duncan used his pistol to shoot the lock off. Inside they had never laid eyes on so much....nothing. There was nothing. 

"Where is all the gold?" Duncan asked aloud.

"Whwere's the giggle dirt" Gunk chimed in 

"This is weird. The way they've been terrorizing the people this place should be full of stolen contraband" Fred said running his hand on the wall.

Back in the van Peppercorn's All See Talky screeched with a hiss and a pop as he threw his ear strone onto the ground. 

"AHHHHH WHAT THE SHIT" He shouted. He grabbed his ear stsone and repalced it back into his ear.

"Fred I'm getting a weird magical feedback. Where are you guys?" Pep asked.

"We're in the empty evidence locker" Fred responded. All I did was touch this wall. As he did again the hiss and pop again crackled through the stone.

"Magical feedback" Pep said. "We're gonna need Chic Pea"


Meanwhile Chic Pea, Sid, and Flyman skulked their way through the fancy oppulance of the mayor's mansion. Occassionaly  ducking out of hte way of a waiter bringing up a whole turkey or a mirror full of giggle dirt.

"This dude's living the life" Sid said with a whisper.

"Where is he getting all of these drugs" Chic Pea said using her tiny finger to pick up some giggle dirt that had spilled onto the rug. She did that thing they do in cop movies where they taste the drugs and know what they are.

"This is pure Wyrdwood White!" She exclaimed. 


Soon they were at the office door of the Mayor himself. They peaked around the corner to see the entrance and only two PODs guarding the door.

Sid slowly drew Socks from out of his sheath and Chic Pea gripped her staff in anticipation.

"On 3" Sid said turning to Chic Pea. "1.......2............"

"Uh Big guy" Chic Pea said pointing toward the guards. There stood Flyman slumping up to the doorway guards.

"Do you guys know where the bathroom is? I had some really bad horse shit earlier and its giving me heartburn. It could be buttburn before all is said and done but I figured I'd go fart over an empy toilet for awhile and see if anything remotely solid comes out"

"JESUS FUCKIN CHRIST MAN" The one paladin said as the other started to dry heave next to him.

Suddenly, mid dry heave, a black katana sliced through the guards neck and lopped his head off. Chic Pea shouted a single magical word and from her staff a snake appeared and bit the other guard several times on the face before disappearing into the ether. The poison took the guard amost instantly as he foamed at the mouth and slumped to the floor convulsing in what probably was a seizure. His brain being eaten by the venom as his neurons fired out for any last grasp of life. There would be none.


"Jesus Orcrist Flyguy what were you doing? You could lhave been killed!" Chic Pea said weirdly concerned.

"I was hoping they would" Flyman said slouching his shoulders and lowering his head.

"Nice work, King" Sid said patting his friend on the head. "Can you open this door, Polly Pocket Pussy" Sid said to Chic Pea.

"I can't portal in. If I could, we could have just portaled into the room and that would be lazy writing althlough it would save on the page count." She said looking at the camera. "There are magical dampening spells all over this place. I could barely use my snake spell since it was a conjuration spell of a living creature. Anything else is blocked"

"I'll do it" Flyman said with a burp. Suddenly he was wretching like a cat at 3am and you have to get up at 6am to be at your girlfriends parents for Spanksgiving. SUddenly a torrent of acidic vomit shot from Flyman's elongated suck hole covering the door. The acid ate through the door like I ate through your mom's beef curtains last night. 

Inside the Mayor was doing a line of giggle dirt off of a sexy skelewoman's....pelvis? You could only really tell it might have been a woman because for osome reason the skeleton was wearing lipstick? I mean it doesn't matter it could be a guy skeleton wearing lipstick I don't care. I just assume. I guess I shouldn't but I'm going by cartoon rules here give me a fuckin break. I'm a simple man. Bugs Bunny dresses up like a girl and I get a boner. What can I say.

"OH MY" the skeleton said covering up her bare ribs. Why was she embarrassed? Like...there aren't boobies there.

"All hail the THIEF" Sid said as he swung Socks around all cool like Obi Wan.

"GET OUT OF HERE YOU....YOU.....DORKS" THe mayor said proud of his quick whit.

"Hey how's it goin'?" Chic Pea said witha  wink at the Skelehooker.

Flyman shuffled in after them and sulked.

"MY GOD WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?" The mayor shouted. "Whatever you want. YOU CAN HAVE WHATEVER YOU WANT just don't let that thing touch me. I, in all my years of politics, have n ever seen a more hidous baby and let me tell you,, I've kissed some real ugly chodey ass babies." The mayor began to dry heave at the sight of Flyman.

"I mean....pretty fucked up to admit to kissing ugly babies man" Sid said thinking too hard about this.

"You can have all the giggle dirt and stanky crank and danky dittles you want" The mayor said using both hands to shovel drugs from out of his drawer where mayor papers usually would be.

"Do you have a bahtroom in here because I really gotta do a #4" Flyman said walking toword the Mayor. The Mayor recoiled in horror as Flyman drew closer. "I ate some bad sidewalk dookies earlier or as I like to call them 'Sidewalk snacks' and my thorax is really acting a fool." Suddenly Flyman let out a fart so heinous that the Mayor straight up Last Crusaded like that Nazi at the end of that movie. His face melted right off and into a puddle on the floor. 


"I told you I had to #4" Flyman said witha  sigh.

"Ok then" Sid said lowering his sword.

"Chic Pea we need you down here" Duncan said in her ear stone.

Chic Pea, Sid, and Flyman burst into the evidence locker only to see how empty it was.

"Looks like the mayor was tooting all the schneef the POD's were confiscating" Sid said looking around.

"There's a doorway here" Chic Pea said as she felt up the wall. Soon a glowing gold archway appeared with steps that lead downward into a dark dank dungeon. The Flamingos cautiously made their way down the long staircase. As it twisted into the darkness below it grew colder and darker. Chic Pea tried to ignite a fire with her staff but the spells were still dampened. Sid held out a gold flame box he had stolen from the mayors office that said "#2 Mayor" on it and ignited it. Chic Pea grabbed a torch off the wall and lit it.

"Thanks stud" She said with a wink. "Number 2 mayor? At least he was modeest" Chic Pea said handing the flame box back.

Soon they reached the end of the stair well and were in a gigantic room filled with gold. 

"The gold from the treasure locker" Duncan said grabbing a handfull of coins and pocketing them.

"Something is weird  here" Fred said looking around.

Suddenly the flames from the braziers all went out. In the pitch black all the crew could see were tiny red glowing eyes.

"Oh fuck not this again" Chic Pea said readier her staff hoping they were far enough down for for the dampening field to be not as effective.

The braziers again shot to life with pure white fire  blinding everyone. THey all covered their eyes and groaned. When the light died down they could see a giant golden pillar in the back of the room surrounded by thousands and thousands of golden spiders. A booming ominous laugh rumbled slowly and lowly through their entire being.

"Fuck this" Duncan said as he pulled a gun out and shot at the pillar. 

P-TING. The bullet just bounced off of the solid gold face of it. A dark red energy began to glow and grow as the laugh boomed louder and louder. 

"AAHHH" Duncan shouted as he flinched toward the pillar. The laugh grew and grew. More and more evil as Duncan began to slide toward the now glowiing red pillar.

"IT HAS HIM" Gunk said trying to grab onto Duncan's arm and pull him back. Duncan's pistols shot out of his hands and flew toward the pillar like two opposing magnets. With a clang they stuck themselves to the pillar.

"HELP US" Gunk shouted as everyone including flyman tried to pull Duncan back.

"Wait" Chic Pea thought. "The gold...the gold in your pocket! DROP IT" She shouted. Frantically Duncan reacheed into his duster pocket and began to toss out the gold coins he had looted. Before they could hit the ground they flew toward the pillar and they too stuck fast to the surface. But unlike the guns the coins began to absord into the pillar. The red energy around them increased and a panel on the pillar opened to reveal one red eye. And the eye laughed. How the hell does an eye laugh?

"ALL OF THE GOLD" Chic Pea shouted as she tugged at Duncan's duster.

"THATS ALL I HAVE" He yelled back at her.

"I'M LOSING MY....GRIP" Fred said as the sleeve of Duncan's duster ripped clean off. 

"FUCK" Sid yelled as the other sleeve of Duncan's duster ripped from his grip. Duncan fell. He fell forward into the eye. The Flamingos stood around horrified. 

"No...." Gunk said quietly. Chic Pea let out a scream. "NOOOO YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM" she yelled as she held out her staff. She sent a lightning bolt right at the eye but it literally didn't even blink. 

"Still dampened" She yelled to no one in particular.

Duncan's body hit the pillar with a bone snapping crack. He was upside down with his back stuck to thie pillar. He grit his teeth in agony as his ribs ached. His lungs were punctured he could feel the blood pooling in his throat as he coughed it up.

"Must be.....these damn silver bulletts" he said with a laugh. "Gotta use them for"

"For werewolves?" Sid asked knowing this was it for Duncan.

"What werewolves are awesome. No." Duncan said wincing. "No man they're for the tax man. I shoot them at him when he comes around. If he finds them well I paid my taxes. If he gets hit with them well....I paid my taxes." Duncan looked at his friends.

"Promise me you'll take care of them" He said blood trickling out of his mouth. He forced a bloody toothed smile at Sid. "Promise"

"I...." Sid just stood there. "I....don't."


"You have to" Ducan yelled. "They need you now"

"I promise" Sid said.

"Now.....get the hell out of here" Duncan demanded as he reached up, which for him was down, for one of his pistols that was stuck to the pillar.

"We HAVE TO GO NOW" Fred yelled pulling on Chic Pea and Gunk. "Sid! HELP ME GET THEM OUT!" Sid snapped back to reality and begane to move toward the stair case upward. Thousands of gold spiders were now marching down the walls and toward them. 

"RUN!" Fred yelled. Gunk was furiously swinging his axe at spiders. Tears in his eyes he looked back one last time at his best friend. Duncan smiled at him as his body rose upward toward the eye. "Wanna see something cool?" He yelled to Gunk.

"Always" Gunk said crying. Duncan slit a silver bullet into his gun and tried with what strength he had left to aim it depsite that an invisible force was pulling the weapon toward the eye. As Ducan's back reached the oraface of the red eye his back buckled inward. It was sucking him into...something.

Gunk let out a painful dwarf war yell and was quickly overrun by spiders. He swung and swung until a large hand grabbed him and ripped him out of the spider pile. 


"LETS. FUCKING. GO" Sid yelled at him. As soon as Duncan saw they had escaped he looked around the room and surveyed every surface. What angle it was at and what metal it was made out of. He did the math quicker than he ever had and let loose a single silver bullet.

It ricocheted around the room hitting off panels and spiders. PTING TING PTING. 

Duncan closed his eyes.

The bullet ripped through his stomach and into othe eye. The eye let out a scream and dropped Duncan.

"At least..." He coughed. "There's a silver lining to all this" he laughed one last laugh and expired.

The room began to shake. The buildling began to shake. The Flamingos ran outward toward the street to find it surrounded by PODs. Most were already running away because they saw some people who could fuck them up and nothing scares them more than other people.

The Flamingos turned around to watch the barracks implode. Not explode. But implode. Red energy shot inward into a the crater that used to be the POD barracks. The remaining PODS fell to their knees and yelled as a red magical myst flowed out of their golden armor. All PODs in Graal wearing that armor were eaten from the inside leaving only a burnt skeleton.

The Flamingos watched in silence as the screams stopped. Everything stopped. Each were crying. Gunk was sobbing and yelling. Chic Pea grabbed to hug Fred. Fred held her tiny body as tears ran down his cheeks.


The END
