In the Beginning (Apocolypse)[I Tried So Hard] - But in the End It Didn't Really Matter feat. UGLa and UGK


	Ugla grasped with her mighty yet perfectly manacured hands up for the next rung of the ancient stone ladder but as she did she slipped and began to fall back down from whence she came.

"GODS FUCKING SHIT" she yelled at herself. "Stupid idiot watch what you're doing" scolding herself as she regainend balance and once again began to climb up the stone ladder. All around her was darkness. She had been in this cave for weeks eating only bugs and the occassional turkey dinner she'd conjure with her magic. Why was she eating bugs then you ask? Have you ever had a Berry Beetle? They taste like fuckin GUSHER bro quit judging and just listen to the story ya fuckin judgy ass biiiiitch!!!


"Okay" Ugla signed as she held onto the ancient smooth rungs. They looked likie living rock. Water must have swept over them for thousands of years making htem glisten and sparkle.

"Ok don't look down" She said to herself as she looked down. "GODS FUCKING SHIT" she yelled again. Below her she saw the ladder which she had been climbing get smaller and smaller until she saw nothing but blackness. She gripped the rungs harder and sighed. She looked up and saw the exact same thing she did while looking down. 

"This is bullshit" She said feeling whoozy. Was she even going up? She grabbed for her flask and took a quick drink. The condensation on the side felt cool on her hands so she placed it on her forehead, but just as she moved to regain her footing she dropped the flask.

"SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitttttttt" The flask said on itss way down into the nothingness which they had just came.  Wait why did the flask say shit? Was it alive? Was it some kind of living magic flask? GOD DAMN you're asking a lot of questions today. FUCK.

Ugla went on no longer sure that this quest was such a good idea. But it had to be. She had no other leads. What was going on in Big D? Something was up. Adventurers missing. Corruption and lawlessness everywhere. The POD's (Paladins of Daranos) were more corrupt than usual which was saying something. ACAB. Shit was fucked.

But so was Ugla. She began to feel REALLY dizzy now. Even though she had just seen her magical living flask fall down she no longer knew what up and down was. The ladder spun being the only frame of reference she had. She began to black out.

"No no no no" She said softer and softer as the dark tunnel what was now her vision began to iris closed. And then she let go.

"SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii." she never finished the sentence. She blacked out mid fall.

(GAAAAAAAAASSP)

Ugla gasped for air and shot upright. She felt around and felt no pain. Nothing. Not even a scratch. As she breathed in the air dust flew from her beard. She used her staff to prop herself up. She had landed on a rocky outcropping. As she looked around she saw the ladder and that she had landed....ON TOP of the ladder? What the fuuck? She scanned around and saw what looked like a cave in. Maybe it was a door at one time but the rocks and whatever magic in this place must have reclaimed it.

'shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTT" She heard as her flask fell and landed beside her with a thud. She picked it up and put it back on her belt.

"Hello there" said and old man's voice from the darkness. Ugla pointed her staff. It's crystal glowing a wild blue and arcing lightning like yo mama was arching her back last night when I was trying out to be your new daddy. Now clean up your hotwheels son because we're going to Pizza Hut. Thats right I'm going to be a good step dad not like my dad was. Oh is this too dark for you? Ok back to the cum jokes.

"You won't need that young lady I've been expecting you" Said the old man. Out from thet dark shuffled a 5 foot tall pointy eared gnome. His robes were old. Like he slept in them ALL the time. As Ugla drew in more breath through her nostrils she could smell him.

"Ughhh...ah I mean I'm Ugla" she said trying to nonchalantly cover her mouth.

"Hello. I am Friddert Bingle" he said extending a hand. Ugla looked at it and what must have been decades of caked on grime. Then that close up thing they do in Ren and Stimpy happened and a foghorn went off as flies flew off of his hand.

"But you can just call me Bingle" he said. Ugla daintily curtsied to avoid his hand stank.

"How...How did I get up here?" She asked as she looked down over the ledge.

"Oh this place is designed to be a maze" Bingle said. "It's like a god damn MC Escher painting fucked a paradox and gave  birth to this place. Have you ever tried finding the bathroom in a maze? I usually just wind up going in the corner over there because I can never find it. I mean the bathrom is really just a bucket anyway so I guess its not too big of a difference but its that extra step that really makes me feel like I'm not some disgusting animal" Bingle trailed on as he shot a snot rockit out of his old red honker.

"Then you're a ...a wizard!" Ugla said with hope. "I thought we were all gone. There are so few of us left" 


"Nope. I'm just the janitor" Bingle said as he flipped his staff around to reveal a mop heaed on the other end. "Wizard who used to run this place skidaddled a long time ago. Or he died. I honestly don't know. Anyway it's just me here now and I figuurd I'd stick around unless someone wanted to show up and read the archives"

"Bingle" Ugla said grabbing his tiny shoulders. "If you weren't so absolutely horrifically covered in your own filth I'd kiss you! The archives! They still work?"

"Oh yes" Bingle said. "Except for the all the times people fuckeed. Those got stolen and uploaded onto Allimewire" Now you can watch anyone fuck from whenever. Everyone has seen everyone else fuck. It's fuckin crazy. Anyway right this way"


As the two walked toward the cave in they morphed right through it. Inside was an ancient library. It had books and tapestries. It had stone tablets and magical all see tablets that you might use to listen to Bros B4 Prose on. There were all see balls of every shape and color. Big balls. Little balls. Oblong balls. Even balls that came in pairs. Two balls. 3 balls? So many balls.

Ugla gasped at the sheer volume of knowledge she was standing in. She could spend a thousand lifetimes here and still never get through it all.

"So what was it you were lookin for young miss" Bingle said as he went behind the desk and put on his librarian spectacles and replaced his overalls with a clearly home made apron that said '#1 Book Boy' 

"I..." Ugla stammered. She snapped herself back to this moment and thought. "I need to see what is happening. There has to be something here that can give me a clue as to what is goinog on out there"

"Well..." Bingle said tapping his chin. "We do have quite a variety of books about torture. You'd be surprised how many people wrote down how to pull someone's peener or peeners off. Apparently its pretty effective"


"That is not at all what I had in mind Bingle" Ugla said picking up a book. She blew the dust off of the cover and it read 'Peeners and You: A Torturers Guide to Puberty'

"Well if'n that ain't what you need...." Bingle began tapping his chin with his other hand too. "Whenever I can't find something I start at the beginning...."

"Wait...you can do that?" Ugla turned to ask.

"Hi...I'm Friddert Bingle" he said holding out his hand. "How can I help you today"

"Uhhhhh" Ugla said wide eyed.

"JUST KIDDING" he said. "I've not been driven insane by the crushing loneliless and silence.....yet" He said. "Come. I let me show you this."

They rounded several corners and found themsevles in a section of the library that didn't have anything to do with peeners or ripping off of peeners. All around them were crystals. Some glowed. Some crackled with power and some were just old and dusty. Kinda lilke yo mama.

"Whoa" Ugla  said looking at the wonderous gems.

Bingle bent down and slid an old box from under some of hte displays. Inside, as she got near, the boxes edges began to glow blue.

"Never seen it do that before. But then agian you're the first wizard I've ever seen" Bingle said as he drew a fist sized glowing blue crystal from out of the box.

"What is this thing? What is it called?" Ugla said slowly reaching out for it but drawing her hand back at the last second.

"The Blue One" Bingle said matter of factly. "But this might be what you need. Go ahead." He said  handing it over to Ugla. And....nothing. Nothing happened.

"Now what?" Ugla said.

"Whenever I need some help I try asking nicely" Bingle said.

"Ok....Uh Blue Cyrstal. Show me what is going on in Daranos. Show me everything from the beginning"

".....Please" Bingle nudged her.

"Oh yes PLEASE" she said correcting herself. Suddenly everything around her went fuckin WILD. Reality itself swirled like the toilet that Bingle could never find. She tried to scream and drop the crystal but it was  no longer in her hands. Book cases snapped in half like match sticks. Books flew off the shelves and exploded into confetti. She tried to turn but her legs wouldn't work.

"Oh for fuck me in the shit" She thought. Again everything went blank.

(GAAAAAAAAAAAAASP)


Again she shot up gasping. This time she could smell the sweet smell of fresh hay. She turned to look at a sheep drinking from a trough. It stopped lapping up water and looked at her only to go back to filling its suck hole with H2O.

Ugla grabbed at her now aching head but as she did she couldn't feel her beard. She panicked and pushed the sheep aside to try and look at her reflection in the water. There she was but instead of her beautiful bearded face with green eyes and DSL's there stood a boy of about 15. She...He was scraggly and dirty and had hay in his hair. He looked like he hadn't showered in like ever which wasn't weird since the Show Nymphs pretty much had the monopoly on showers anyway. Ugla looked up. In the suns light she could make out the feint impressions of Daranos's moons. There they were...all....wait.....ALL 3 OF THEM?!?!?

"BOY!" Said a stern voice from far away. "BOY get over here and shoe my horses. And then unshoe them so we can play horse shoes. AND THEN SHOE THEM AGAIN"

Was she the boy? I mean she was A boy. She reached into her pantaloons. Yep. Definitely a boy peener in there.

Just then a tall armor clad Elf turned the corner into the stable. He was blonde and very very white. He looked young and rich. On his hands were all sorts of rings and around his neck was a medallion of the COOL S symbol. He also had a sword that was almost as big as Ugla...er....boy Ugla...BUGLA was now.

"My god boy how many times have I told you to stop playing with yourself around the sheep!" Said the elf grabbing Ugla by the ear. "I know you find them sexually attractive but try to keep it under control"

"MASTER MASTER" yelled another boy. He ran up to the elf out of breath. "Master Alynth....There's a missive here for you from the Wizard Consortium"

"Hand it over other boy" said the Master. The boy handed over a parchment. Master Alynth read over it and folded it back over.

"Whoa an actual parchment" Ugla said. "No All See Balls...."


Alynth laughed. "What in praytell is an 'AllSeeOrb, Boy? Have you been drinking toilet wine again?" Both Alynth and Other boy laughed. 

"QUIET OTHER BOY" Alynth snapped. "Ok you may laugh again but keep it to a quiet RESPECTFUL chortle."

The Other boy slunk his chin down to his chest and chortled.

"An All See BALL" Ugla corrected them. "It's a device that lets you talk to people whenever you want and watch All See Talkies and capture memories for watching later and..."


"Psssshhh" Alynth waved a hand. "Yes we all have MAGICAL THINGS we carry around in our coin purses that let us communicate with each other OVER VAST DISTANCES INSANTANEOUSLY as if BY MAGIC" Alynth said laughing. He turned to other boy.

"Young Darren here must have the Herpetic Brain Pox. Probably from sleeping next to those sheep and doing gods knows what else with them. Now. Saddle Up Boy I will need a squire to accompany me on my journey. My journey TO SAVE THE REALMS!" Alynth said doing a statue-esque pose. The wind gently blew through his haid as Other Boy slowly golf clapped.

Ugla was off. They rode for days. Her boredom was highlighted only by the occasional story from Alynth Foreverwood about  how he was the greatest blah blah in all of othe blah blah blah. One night Ugla began to fall asleep atop her clip clopping horse as they rode through yet another rain storm.

"Hey" said a voice from beside her.  She shot awake and looked around. There was nothing.

"You gonna be awhile in there?" The voice asked.

"Who said that" she said quietly.

"Me...I did. Or rather I did who is you" a young boys voice replied. Just then a boy of about 15 with dirty hair and wearing a potato sack, as was the style at the time for slaves, flashed into being right next to her. He glowed blue around the edges and was somewhat transparent. If Ugla wasn't so used to ghosts and ghosts sucking peoples dicks and ghost dicks being sucked by other ghosts she might have screamed, but as a wizard you get used to seeing blue shit a lot.

"Darren" she said.

"Yeah. So you wanted to see THIS journey huh?" He said kicking back in mid air like was sitting in a recliner.

"What is this place?" Ugla asked.

"This is the Kingdom of Stinia" Darren said. "Over there is Stinia Castle and over there.."

"NO no I mean what is this world" Ugla corrected.

"It's our world. Your world. It just looks a little different" Darren said. Ugla looked up at the night sky. Rain hit her face and she squinted through drops to see the 3 moons abover. There was of course Bodonk the reddish moon and her sister moon Adonk the yellowish moon but htis third moon she didn't recognize at all. It was blueish in color. And it looked like maybe it was a lot bigger than she had seen it before.

"Ah yes" Darren said. "That's why you're hear. To see me...I mean you....you as me, to see us stop the moon from falling and to see us save the world."

"Pssshh" Ugla laughed. "That's just a kids story from a picture pop up scroll" 

"Admiitedly a lot of the story is wrong...and pretty bad. But this is THAT quest. The one where I became the king of what will be called in my honor Daranos."

"I dont remember a royal DICKBAG from the stories" Ugla said gesturing to Alynth.

"Oh yeah. In some versions he's a talking donkey" Darren said. Ugla laughed aloud.

"QUIET BOY" Alynth said half alseep. "Sheep fuckin sassafrassin I'll show you laughing...." 

They both laughed. 

"Okay so next you're gonna tell me I have to find the Guantlet of Darren?"

"Yes. How else are you going to stop the moon from crashing into the ground?" Darren replied. "But in this time its just called The Gauntlet."

"Alright. But can we skip to the end I have no idea what that librarian janitor is doing with my body in that vault"

Back at the Library Vault Bingle sipped his tea and passed a crumpet to Ugla's unconcious yet propped up body. On her was a bonnet and make up that looked like it was done by a toddler. 

"Oh well Miss Ugla I do declare!" Bingle said doing a spit take. "You tell the most INNAPPRORIATE jests" Binglel adjusted his own bonet and applied more lipstick around his filthy mouth. 

"Have you seen Mrs Crabtree's new Tea dress" Bingle saiid to Ugla, her eyes still closed. Just then a rat wearing a doll's dress scurried accross the table, picked up a single grape, and ran off with it.

"You MUST tell me who your stylist is dear" Bingle said to the scurrying away rat.

Back in the past Ugla had now fast forewarded to the day of reckoning. On her wrist was a silver bejeweled gauntlet. The blue gems crackled with power as she, as Darren, held her hand up to the sky. The moon which was falling toward them was now the size of the province of Chode Island. It was icy. Made out of ice. In the stories it was said that when Darren stopped the falling moon the ice melted and formed the greatest lakes in Daranos. Ugla knew better. Having see Darren's story in some kind of year of hell holodeck episode fuckery she now knew that the moon wasn't ice. It was metal. The blue icy metal known as Cold Steel. An ancient and rare metal that was priceless. But not like priceless like asit means like...worthless. Priceless like we coloquially say now adays when someothing is very very valuable. It's one of those weird words that means one thing and the exact opposite at the same time. WHat are those called? DUMB WORDS.

Cold Steel hadn't been seen in Daranos for a long long time. Most people just assumed it was a part of the childrens tale, as Ugla had done. Now with the moon crashing down, flaming and fiery, coming at speeds Ugla could only imagine, Ugla was getting nervous.

"You uh...you wanna step in here?" She said to Darren's ghost.

"Nah you're doing great. Plus I've done this already like a zillion times."

Ugla looked back up. The wind was howling now. The mountaintop on which they stood was shaking. Around her trees began to groan and their branches snapped like my mom at Thanksgiving that one time because of the cranberry sauce. It was getting ugly.

"Just...stop the moon" Darren said biting into a ghost batple.

Ugla held up her hand. The gauntlet glowed even brighter but the moon was still coming in hot.

"You have to want it" Darren said.

"You don't think I want to stop A FUCKING MOON from crushing me and everything I know!?" She yelled back.

"I dont know you seem kind of not into it today" Darren said. "Besides what do you care if the moon falls? This isn't real. You'll wake up in your library or whatever you said and be just fine."

"I need to know whats happening to my Daranos" She yelled. "I need to stop whatever evil is there for the sake of all of us! Even the Dogmen who lick their own Bholes on the corner like nobody can see them tongueing that thing. I dont even know why that stupid gem is showiing me this. I gave up things for this! People I love. I walked away from my friends and family and everything I loved to fix Daranos. JUST FUCKING TELL ME WHAT THIS IS"

Darren stood next to her and looked up. "Yup...that sure is gonna hit us" he said. Above them flames began to ignite the atmosphere. Clouds and flocks of birds began to spontaneoulsy combust. It began to rain. But not water rain. It was ash and blood and soot and mud. Everything that was on that glowing scalding rock was melting and falling down onto them. Ugla looked up again. She saw death. The moon itself looked like a crystal flaming skull with its jaw wide open ready to devour everything. She even thought she heard it laugh. The rain began to fall harder and harder. 

"Ouch" She said. "What the fuck this rain hurts" As she looked down she saw pools of liquified and slowly harndening gold falling. 

"Wait" she said holding up the gauntlet again. The Gauntlet glowed stronger as she thought about all her friends. Axl and Fred. Buffcat and even Flyman. The gauntlet RAGED with power now. She held her hand aloft again and thought about Axl. She did love him. She would spend the rest of her life with him. She missed him but it didn't make her sad. Even the missing felt good because she was thinking about him and she knew who he was. Completely for all time. Just then a blue beam as bright as a thousand suns shot from the palm of the gauntlet. Ugla screamed as she felt real pain throughout her whole body. She clenched her teeth and as a few of htem cracked in her mouth she tasted the iron taste of blood in the back of her throat. She spit and grunted moving her feet to stabilize herself. She screamed one final scream and then silence.

In the palm of her hand was a  moon. An entire celestial body. She was holding up a moon.

"GODS FUCKING SHIT" she said almost crying.

"See I knew you could do it" Darren said walking up to her. He reached his ghostly azure hand out and touched the surface. TTSSSS 

"Ouchy" he said.

"Still hot?" Ugla asked.

"Nah its actually pretty cool all things considered." They looked around to see the mountain top strewn with just all kinds of shit. Dead trees and birds lay everywhre. But on one branch that miracualously still had leaves on it stood a little bird chirping and cleaning itself.

"Now what" Ugla said.

"Put it down" Darren laughed.

Ugla concentrated and moved the massive moon down the mountainside. It was huge. It flled the mountain valley below and several other mountains began to crumble as she placed it down. It thudded down. The rumbling of hte earth below them was as if they were ants and were on a church bell.

"Wanna see what happens next?" Darren asked.

"Yes" Ugla said.

Darren waved his hand forward and time began to speed up. The trees around them bloomed and their leaves fell. Hordes of people from all walks of life zipped around like little insects. They carved out the moon and over the decades or maybe centuries built The Blue Castle. A giant megastructure made of solid Cold Steel. Ugla moved out of hte way of a train of miners as they zipped past her with crates and carts FULL of gold. Inside Darren sat on a throne of Cold Steel. Next to him sat a sword made of cold steel and gold. It was plunged into a solid chunk of blue hardened rock. The gaunltet still on his hand. Ugla watched as he grew old. Then he grew ANCIENT. Then he grew so old he couldn't move. Soon the great blue halls of the fortress grew dark. Vines began to snake accross everything. Animals picked up food where once people stood.

All the while Darren sat on his throne. Long dead. His skeleton now only covered by his Golden Curaiiss and The Gauntlet. As the centuries turned to milleniia Ugla watched as grave robbers and passers buy plucked every bit of gold and cold steel from the structure itself. It melted away in time like ice cream in summer. Time filled in the  mountains with more mountains and water and dirt and rocks. It ate away at what was once forever like foam in a rootbeer float until there was nothing but an ordinary mountain range.

"See" Darren said. "Now oyou know how to stop a moon. So you can probably do something like that again. Or get someone else to do it I don't care" he said.

Ugla looked around in silence. The dusty wind blew through her long brown hair and beard. Wait. She was her again.

She looked at Darren. He nodded and vanished.

She woke up with a jolt like from a night terror. On her face she felt caked on make up and around her neck the string of a tied on bonnet.

"A tea party. Really?" She said to Bingle

"WHY I NEVER" he said fanning himself with an imaginary fan.
