EP 19 Theme From Tit-tanic


	The moons over Daranos hung over a dark forest like 2 double G hangers hung over my face last night. The crickets chirped loudly as 3 dark figures made their way through the pitch black woods quietly. 

CRUNCH

"SHHH QUIET" Sid scolded.

"I'm sorry I think I stepped on a cricket" Flyman fessed up. "It's probably for the best anyway little guy you wouln't like living. It's too much work and you'll probably just screw things up like get captured by blobs and then step  on a cricket when you're tryinig to be sneaky at night through the woods for some reason"

Flyman hung his head low as Gary the Skeleman came up behind him and put a reashuring boney hand on his shoulder.

"It's ok Flyguy" he said with a pat.

"Look its fine. But we don't know where we are and those gelatinous cube bois could be anywhere. Or even a MIMIC. Those guys can look like anything...like...even a gelatinous cube boi"

"Sorry Sid" Flyman said whiping a single tear away from his gigantic compound eye. As he did he sleeve singed and burnt.

"SHUSH" Sid again said. Socks ran ahead with his adorable ears all perked up and sat atop a fallen tree.

"What is it boy?" Sid asked as if the cat was going to tell him.

"Mew" he said and continued to run ahead.

"LETS GO" Sid said and with a dash of thief speed bolted ahead after his cat.

Flyman and Gary huffed and puffed as they caught up to the speedsters in the lead. Up ahead they could see Sid and Socks looking out over a fast moving river. The sound of water splashed off of rocks and onto the shore as Flyman and Gary both bent over with their hands on their knees gasping for air.

"Wait...." Flyman huffed. "Why.....(huff)are you.....(huffhuff) breathing so......hard....." he questioned Gary.

"Oh I just didn't want you to feel badly about you being so terribly pathetically out of shape so I'm pretending I too can't catch my breath. Even though technically I guess I can't" As he finished he flashed his bare ribs where inside a Spider had made a web. The spider looked at Flyman and said "THE HELL ARE YOU LOOKIN AT FREAK" and then gave him the finger and slammed the door to his web house?

"Well the good news is I know where we are now" Sid said turning around to face the others.

"Oh god whats the bad news" b Flyman whined.

"The bad news is that this is the Creeping Death River." Sid added.

"Maybe they call it that because  nobody has ever died in it...you know like how Iceland is called Iceland but they dont' really have any ice...just those Giants that drink those huge Frostees?"

"And over there is Drown in Your Sleep While You Scream Out For Your Mommy curve..." 

"Maybe they call it that because..."


"OH  GOD" Flyman now began to sob uncontrolably.

"WAIT" Sid said holding a hand out. "HIDE something is coming" The other two tried to hear what it was but couldn't. Nevertheless they did as they were told and hid behind a rock on the river's edge.

The 3 waited quietly as slowly they could hear a reggae tone beat approaching from down river. The beat got funkier and funkier and closer and closer until finallly they could see a fully decked out party boat made from what looked like an old casino ship. On the deck they could see booties bouncing and drinks spilling. Sid slowly sat up squintying to see past all the neon magical lamps and strobe crystals this thing had blazing all over its hull. Suddenly a spot light hit Sid and stuck on him.

"HELLO OVER THERE!" Yelled a female voice. "NEED A RIDE?!?" Both Flyman and Gary stood up slowly and stared at what was presumably the captain of the vessel. She was wearing a bikini and a captains hat and her huge mommy milkers were just hanging over the railing like the 2 moons of Daranos. Suddenly the spider that was living in Gary's rib cage opened up his spider web door as his tongue hit the ground like in those cartoons from 40's and said "I'm gonna build a web IN THERE"

"Same" Flyman said dejectedly somehow.

"Flyman..."Sid smirked. "You're still the king"

A dingy approached as the Captain of the Party Ship held a flag on the back like George Washington except the flag was just a torn up old Big Johnson tshirt.

"Welcome aboard boys" the captain said. He eyes were pitch black and her hair was pure white.

"An angel"...Gary whispered as he grabbed her hand as she helped him into the small craft.

"Actually" she corrected. "I'm a siren. We travel up and down the water ways luring men to their deaths."

The 3 turned slowly and looked at the Captain.

"Wow" she began to laugh. "Just kidding guys. I am a siren but nowadays we just do event planning. Like we host bachelor parties, graduation parties, Gwar Mitzvahs and stuff like that."

Sid felt Socks on his back who had returned to sword form. He quietly turned and whispered to Socks. "Better stay incognito lil buddy..." Socks reciprocated with a soft mew from his hilt mouth. 

As they arrived back at the party ship the party was in full swing. On the deck people were dancing and having a blast. Couples were making out on couches and the DJ was playing every some you love from that time of your life that you think is really special and 'ya just h ad to be there man'. As the 3 made their way inside the ship they gasped at the sheer size of it. It was crazy big AND they had a popcorn machine!

"You're welcome to stay until the next stop" The Captain said. "But I will have to ask you to surrender any weapons you may have on your person. We are a party boat not a stabby boat." She said with a giggle.

"Riiiiight" Sid said handing over Socks.

"What about you cutie?" She said to Flyman

"I'm not allowed sharp objects on account of I am a danger to myself" he whined. "Some people say my depression does make them want to kill themselves though so does that count?"

"No. Not at all" Said the captain as she patted Flyman on the head. 

"OH MY" shouted Gary excitedly. "Is that my favorite drinking game, 21 Hump Streak, they're playing over there" His eyes shot over to a table of a bunch of frat Orcs playing a card game. Sid looked at Gary and rose an eyebrow.

"Ok so its like Blackjack but if you bust you have to finish your drink. The goal is to get as close to 21 as you can BUT if you're the lowest you have to drink AND hump a random inanimate object OR go streaking. We used to play this all the time at Bonerversity" Gary said making his way over to the frat orcs.

"Gentelmen I say do you have room for one more!" He said already sitting in an empty seat.

"You boys are welcome to participate in any and all events planned this evening" The Captain directed her attention back to Sid. "Perhaps we could interest you two in a massage or maybe a dip in our Bonelympic sized all soda swimming pool complete with all you can eat feces buffet?"

At this Flyman perked up as much as a clynically depressed suicidal abomination could perk up. 

"I'll...I'll catch you later Sid" He said as he linked arms with the Captain and they made their way to the aft of the ship.

SId shook his head and headed over to the bar.

MEANWHILE in the weapons locker Socks waited in sword form patiently as 2 dwarves threw a bunch of axes and blunderbusses into storage. They agrued about who of the two of them had the most "rock shaped dick" and jabbed each other as they laughed. Socks heard hte storage locker gate close and morphed back into cat form. He looked around with his giant green eyes. The muffled sounds of the words most crazy party vibrated through the ship. As Socks approached the gate he did that cat thing where they have no shoulders and slipped right out through the vertical slit in the gate. He would have to make himself scarce but he was a master of stealth and cuteness. He krept slowly down a hallway which was filled with doors, presumably cabins for the party goers. He peeked his little adorable face around a corner. The coast was clear.

"Mew" he heard from down the hall. His tail perked up and his ears shot back. Down the hall he saw what looked like a white puffy tail whisp its way around another turn and out of sight.

"Meewwww' he thought rubbing his cute chin. He followed.

"So what'll it be, stud" the hot bartender said as he ran an ice cube down his bare as fuck muscly ass chest.

"One Blood Lite" Sid said curtly.

"You got it sexy muffin kitten sex uh...pants"

The bartender slid a mug of frothy grog down the bar and Sid expertly grabbed it mid slide spiilling some onto the bar. He turned around and took in what was going on. This was really one hell of a party. 

"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND BLOB PEOPLE" an announcer's voice boomed over an all hear mic. "Kareoke will start in 10 minutes! If you'd like to sign up please come up and write your name in blood on this legally binding parchment that you totally don't need to read or have a lawyer look over"

"Fuck" Sid said under his breath.

"Whats the matter baby sweet loins daddy hunky sexy daddy?" the bartender asked Sid as he whiped down the bar. "Don't like Kareoke?"


"No" Sid said matter of factly. "I fuckin LOVE Kareoke"

The next few hours were a blur. Sid sang through all of the greatest 90s hits including This is How We Do It AND Shoop. The crowd loved it. After each song they bought him another round and cheered his name. "SID SID SID" they chanted as Sid did lines of Giggle Dirt off of tables and tits and all kinds of surfaces. Every song upped the ante. Each song perfectly flowing with the mood of the crowd. This was like Druid Prom boofed some Schneef up its own piss hole and then did ecstacy with the entire cheerleading team as they combed  his hair like in that one Snoop Dogg video. The hours felt like minutes and Sids singing voice got better and better as the night raged on. 

"WHer...." He fumbled his words. "Where's FLYMAN he's GOTTA SEE THIS" He said to some rando.

"And Gary....that guy loves...(hic) he fuckin is a skeleton he loves singing"

SID SID SID! The cheered for one last song. Sid snapped back into party mode and picked his night ending slow jam. All My Life by K-Ci and Jojo. As he started the song the strings came in silency the entire crowd. People were gonna score tonight and he was gonna be a big part of it. As much as if he'd be gliding their slippery dirty meat parts into one another himself.

"I will find another lover sweeter than you more precious than you" he belted out the notes perfectly.

People were practically dry humpin each other the slow jam was working so well. As he continued he remembered listening to this song with Ugla. How much she hated it. Or how much she pretended to hate it. He'd caught her in the kitchen one morning humming the chorus and swaying back and forth as she made the two of them Sip Root Tea. He remembered her eyes. He thought about how their purple seemed to get lighter as the suns got higher in the sky. How her blazing blonde hair melted into her white robes. How her beard would blow away from her face at night while she snored. As the song ended he was no longer singing but just staring ahead where he saw blazing blonde hair move through the crowd and out the door to the deck of the ship.

"Ugla" he whispered into the all hear mic.

"UGLA WAIT" he now yelled. The song faded away and the people kept slow dancing. Some probably embarrased to stop because they had jizz stains from all the dry humping.

Sid ran out the door and looked around. All around the party was still raging on. He saw Gary still at the card table but he was DECKED out in gold. He cheered and smiled wide and saw his teeth were all now gold teeth with diamons and rubies in them that spelled out "BONEZ" with a z.

"Gary!" Sid shouted. But it was of no use. Gary was INTO whatever game they had moved onto. Sid scanned the area and again saw a swish of a white wizard robe flow through a door that led outside to the main deck. He shoved and pressed his way through the party crowd getting more and more frustrated as he lost sight of the white robed figure. He spilled a goblins drink but the goblin just smiled at him and said "Its cool baaaaaaby" in his best Austin Powers voice because that was a thing again apparently.

As he made his way outside the noise of the party quited but for just a moment. He saw a white robe dash into another doorway along the starboard side of the party ship. Quickly he rushed to the door and flung it open.

On the other side was Socks who was coming out the door Sid was going into.

"SOCKS!" Sid yelled.

"MEW" Socks yelled.

Sid thought a minute and held out his arm for socks to climb up. 

"We have to get out of here Socks" he said matter of factly.

"ATTENTION!" the announcer's voice again boomed throughout the ship. "Will everyone please gather in the main party stage room. ATTENTION please make your way to the main party stage!"

As Sid and Socks rounded back the way they came they saw every single patron drop what they were doing immediately. People stopped smooching mid make out sesh only to robotically stand up and starting moving in a slow orderly line inside the bow of the ship.

Sid looked over at Socks on his shoulder. "Guess we better follow along for now" he whispered as Socks mew'd a quiet affirmative.

Soon they were all gathered in a giant room with a stage. Like a giant theatre but with tables. Like a club right out of the 6920's. Some real Great Goblinsby shit.

"SID" Gary said rolling up to sid with like a Mr. T amount of bling around his boney neck. On top of his head was a tiara that said "Maid of Honor". 

"Gary we have to leave now" Sid said. 

"Yeah I know. I realized after winning all night long that I've never, and I MEAN NEVER, had a win streak like this. I fleeced every single ding dong in this place at almost every game. It was thrilling at first but then it just became like this Twilight Zone-esque repetative hell"

"Hi guys...." Flyman said sighing as his shoulders dropped. "I got kicked out of the soda pool for doing a number 3 against one of those jets that shoots soda back into the pool." 

"Flyman thats fine whatever man. We need to leave." Sid whispered.

"AND NOW" the annoucner began. "To finish off the perfect night I welcome you ALL to....THE ZOOOOOO" As he finished the most bass ass technotronic music started blasting through the room as a neon sign that said "THE ZOO" floated down from the cieling.  Everyone was raving hard. Like robots they went from completely still to going comlpetely rave wild like this was 1998 and their mom just bought them UFO's at Hot Topic.

"The fuck" Sid said. "Lets go" 

As they made their way to the entrance they noticed a large Orc bouncer standing guard but INSIDE the door. He looked at the trio and  waved his finger as if to say "not today boys".

"Shit" Sid said

"Sorry tahts probably me" Flyman said. "I hate a literal ton of shit at the fecal buffet before they kicked me out of the pool for jizzing it all to heck and back."

"This way" Sid redirected the group.

"AND NOW FOR SPECIAL GUEST BOOTY COLLILNLS" the announcers said as famous troll funkmaster Booty Collins began to slap some funk beats so sick they'd make your mom's dried up old twat tunnel soaking wet like she just jizzed up a soda pool.

Sid moved to another side door and opened it only to see the back of the sexy Captain standing in front of them. He moved to close the door again hoping she didn't notice them but instead, with a howling bellow straight from Hell itself, screamed at a pitch so high that only dogs and your slutty wet mother could hear it. Sid and Flyman grabbed their ears and yelled in pain. The Siren stopped and in one overly slow motion turned her head to the left. But where a head would normally stop it just kept turning. Slowly as the profile became a full frontal face view of a black eyed blonde haired harpy stared back at them with her head backwards. She snapped a finger and her blonde hair became wet and black. Like the color of a nosebleed when you break all the blood vessels at once. Her body cracked and snapped as it turned black and wet all while it moved itself completely independant from the now reversed head. It creaked its way back into a normal body position. Her once huge titties now still huge but like spooky and huge. They were h onestly still dope as fuck and I'm not gonna lie I looked at them.

As she wretched forward water spilled off of her like she was leaking. The boat around them began to creak and splinter. The guests in the party room groaned and moaned as they too turned desicated and grey. Some lost jaws. Some lost limbs. The smell of a thousand dead bodies filled Sid's nostrils. In that moment he wished he was Gary just so that he couldn't smell the horrid death that filled the room.

Booty Collins began to look around mid bass solo.

"Nope I'm getting the wobbledly dobbledy fuck outta here BABY" he said as he began to leave the stage. But it was too late. A group of zombified strippers began to decend on him all at once like they were giving him a lap dance from hell and he had just hit up the ATM. His screams were smothered all too quickly by the butt meat that surely caved his skull. That kind of cheek meat has weight to it and those girls were professionals.

"BOOTY NO" shouted Gary as he tried to make his way to the stage to help the funk allstar.

"Its...Okay baby" Booty said coughing up spurts of blood. "I died doing what I love....getting smashed by top quality back hams straight from the top shelf of the sex deli". And those were his last words as Booty Collins died having his skull crushed in by several asses the size of the state of Assachuesettes.

"SOCKS NOW" Sid yelled as Socks morphed into his sword form again. The blazing black katana blade reflectionless against the now dark and gray room. The walls themselves were begininng to fade in and out of reality. Some of these zombies weren't just zombies but htey were GHOST ZOMBIES.

"DID YOU ENJOY THE PARTY?" The now sickenly decayed Siren began to screech. "BE SURE TO RATE AND REVIEW US....IN HELLLLLL" 

"Hey Captain Bitch" Sid said with a smirk. "You're fied" he said as Socks' blade lit ablaze with hot blue flame. Sid swung his sword and cut right through the Captain. She hissed and screamed but the blade didn't cut her. It passed through her now non corporial body. The Ghost Zombies around them all hissed at the bright flame as Gary and Flyman huddled closer to the only thing that could save them. A cat in the form of a sword.

"BACK BACK YOU CURRS" Gary yelled as he began to throw jewels at the ghost zombies. They each passed right through them. Sid and the gang made their way to the open deck of the ship which was  now ablaze with a white ghostly fire.

"JUMP" Sid yelled. Gary threw himself overboard and splashed back into the river.

"But I just got my mocassins dried out from earlier" Flyman cried not wanting to jump in the water.

"JUMP FLYMAN" Sid said as he grabbed the back of his friends neck and through both he and Flyman overboard.

The Captain laughed and cackled as the ghost party ship floated down the river. As it began to sail out of site they again heard the reggae music start playing. The ghostly form of the ship again vanished back into a regular looking boat. People cheered and partied again as they had been doing for gods know how long before. An endless party where the giggle dirt never ran out and you could fuck a pool filter or whatever it was that Flyman's fantasy was. He's got problems.

The 3 swam back to the other side of the shore out of breath and tired. Sid put Socks down as he morphed back into a cat. He hopped up on Sids shoulder and began to lick the water off os his nose.

Flyman just groaned as he rung out his wet mocassins into the river. 

"What I don't get is" Gary began. "Why did they hire a regular guy like Booty Collins to perform on a ghost ship of doom? Like is there some kind of ghost talent agent going onto the all see web and putting up ads for regular famous performers to perform only to then kill them? It all just seems really unnescesary and elaborately silly. Ya know?"

Sid just looked at Gary. "This is why WE NEED TO REMAIN QUIET AND  NOT MAKE NOISE AND NOT GO ONTO HAUNTED PARTY BARGES OR GO TO BLOB FEASTS OR FUCKIN EVEN THINK OR SAY ANYTHING ELSE UNTIL WE REACH CIVILIZATION!" Sid screamed.

Just then they heard a snap of a twig.

"SHUT UP IDIOTS" Sid said. They quietly krept their way through the woods only to see a faint light from a fire in a clearing. They snuck slowly up to see a bone van parked in the middle of the woods. This would have been weird if Sid hadn't just been on a haunted party boat from Hell. Sid slowly reached for Socks and unsheathed him.

Just then he heard a CLICK.

"Don't. Fucking. Move" a voice said. Sid felt the muzzle of a revolver pressed against his temple.

In flash Sid moved with the speed of lightning and he had socks pressed up against the man holding the guns neck. It was like that scene in Cowboy Bebop in Ep 5 when Vicous fights Spike. Anime as all fuck.

"You guys aren't ghost zombies or mimics or flesh eating cubes or honey traps waiting to eat our flesh are you?" Sid questioned.

Just then Chic Pea and Gunk stepped out of the side of the van. Chic Pea lit up her staff with electircal energy and Gunk swung a huge war hammer over his shoulders and let his arms hang off of it like cool guys do in movies.

"You guys aren't like....the cops are you? You have to like...tell us if you are" Chic Pea replied.

Just then Fred stepped out of the van to see what was going on. As soon as he saw Sid he dropped his sword. It rang witg a clang against the ground.

"SID?" He said. 

"Fred!?" Sid said trying to move to see his long time friend. As he did the revolver clicked again in his ear.

"Where's my sister?" Fred asked. "Where's Ugla?"

"It's a long story" Sid replied.


FIN
