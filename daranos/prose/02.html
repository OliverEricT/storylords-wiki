	Prompts: Portraits & Breweries
</p>
<p>
		Water dripped down the side of an alley building's awning like sweat drip down my balls. The night was quiet. Almost....TOO quiet. A rat scurried across an ally way where a cloaked figure shuffled stealtily with the confidence that only a two dicked <a href="/daranos/creatures/troll">troll</a> could have. His tusks shown in the brazier light...one as gold as your mama's award winning thicc ass booty. Whats her number dawg? Lemme hit up your mom? I'll be a good dad. We can go to the park. Do you know how to shave?
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/daranos/characters/sid">Sid</a> the Rogue slipped in and out of a few doorways finally finding his way into a dirty ass basement that'd make even your thicc mama say, "BOYS clean this mess up right now because when your father comes home I'm gonna sit on your fathers face and make his death look like an accident so we can get the insurance money to buy a new basement because honestly this one is FUCKED".
</p>
<p>
	"Ah Sid" a dark and gravely voice said from the musty dank. "I trust you found your way". Sid slipped off his hood and looked around. They were alone....almost TOO alone. 
</p>
<p>
	"You got the coin?" Sid queried gruffly.
</p>
<p>
	"Always so quick to blow your load all over my business tits Sid my friend" Said the figure as he emerged from the dark. This made Sid wince. There he stood in all leather with an excecutioners mask complete with ball gag? In his hand he held a giant double axe with a big ass floppy dildo on the handle. Of what Sid could see of his face, it was scarred and gray. He could see red veins in his hands and he was fuckin jacked! Dude could probably lift a bonercycle over his head and spin it on one finger. This figure was none other than <a href="/daranos/characters/glimp">Glimp</a> the Sexecutioner.
</p>
<p>
	"I need you to steal me the finest potion ever made" Glimp said licking his SDSL's (Sick Dick Sucking Lips). 
</p>
<p>
	"Coin first" Sid reminded.
</p>
<p>
	"Of course of course" Glimp said as he sidled up to Sid's side. Glimp put a clammy hand on Sids shoulder and with his other hand, which was a hook, he held up a purse of gold.
</p>
<p>
	"Get me what I need and I can get you....more pleasurable rewards" Glimps tongue circled the outside of the ball gag and licked Sid's cheek.
</p>
<p>
	"How do you even talk with that thing in there" Sid said nonchalant.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh this? Yeah I mean my gag relflex is all but gone. You should see what kind of fruits I can deepthroat man. Also like you get used to it. I'm kind of like a ventriloquist at this point but, ya know, I actually get laid....LIKE ALL THE TIME" Glimp laughed evily as he slunk back into the shadows.
</p>
<p>
	"Uh ok well I'm gonna get going"
</p>
<p>
	Silence deafened the room. "Ok..."
</p>
<p>
  <b>"REMEMBER"</b> Glimps voice again boomed out of the darkness...."Get me <a href="/daranos/items/theholyviagrale">the Holy VIAGRALE</a>!"
</p>
<p>
	The Holy Viagrale. A potion so potent that it definitely will keep you hard for more than 4 hours and when it does there's no point in seeking out alchemic attention, you're in for one wild night. Sid had been doing easy jobs like this for a few weeks to keep his mind off of...well....everything.
</p>
<p>
	"Ugla...." he sighed. Just one more job and he would go back. He'd make it right.
</p>
<p>
	Soon he reached a large wooden warehouse type building. Sid took out a cool crossbow and fired a bolt to the top of the building where he Batmaned his ass up to the roof. Once up there he found a glass moon window. Sid reached up and cracked his gold tooth out of his mouth and began to trace a line in the glass. Soon the glass cutout fell but Sid quickly grabbed it so it wouldn't break.  Once inside he looked around. The darkness was heavy. Almost like the heaviness he felt in his heart for his bearded beloved.
</p>
<p>
	"A brewery" he thought to himself. "Good place to hide an illegal alchemy lab"
</p>
<p>
	He turned a corner and stopped dead in his tracks. A long hallway lay before him. On each wall large mirrors were pointed in different directions.
</p>
<p>
  "<b>LASARS</b>" he thought. <a href="/daranos/magic/laser">LASAR</a> or "Light Always Shining Alarm Relay" was advanced magic. These fuckers were rich and highly prepared. Sid reached into his sack and pulled out a bottle of <a href="/daranos/items/glitterdust">Glitterdust</a>. He blew a handful at the LASARS and in an instant could see white hot beams of magical holy light bouncing all around the hallway. With ease Sid <i>Catherine Zeta Jones'd</i> his way through the LASARS using <a href="/daranos/misc/tantrickungfu">Tantric Kung Fu</a> he learned when he spent that semester on <a href="/daranos/locations/mtmamory">Mt. Mamory</a> studying with the <a href="/daranos/groups/fuckmonks">Fuck Monks of the Order of the Crouching Threeway</a>. 
</p>
<p>
	Soon he reached an office type room. Books and paintings covered the walls. These alchemists were raking in the gold from this operation. This had to be where the Vaigrale was hidden. If he was really lucky perhaps Sid would find the recipe. Quietly Sid dug through his <a href="/daranos/items/neverendingsatchel">neverending satchel</a> and dug out a pair of steam punk looking goggles. These had been a gift from <a href="/daranos/characters/ugla">Ugla</a>. Ugla he sighed again. Once on the goggles allowed the wearer to see wherever anyone had been in any given room. But when Sid placed them on his face windows all he could see was blown out white. I mean this place was covered in activity. There were hand prints on the wall. Boob prints on the hand prints. He scanned slowly and saw cheek marks on the seats and ball marks on other seats. One long girthy mark coiled around the bottom of a chair and wrapped around the desk. Either that was a snake man or someone has a fuckin KING KONG sized donger. 
</p>
<p>
	Sid stepped closer to the paintings checking behind them for a safe or a hidden door. Places like this were fuckin RIDDLED with hidden doors. Nothing.
</p>
<p>
	Sid sighed. "Ok think" he said to hmself. Suddenly out of hte corner of his eye he sensed movement coming from one of the paintings. It was a painting of the room he was standing in. Weird.
</p>
<p>
	He walked over to it and felt around the edge for any clues. He could have sworn he saw soemthing move. The painting was large. Even hung up high it must have been as tall as Sid. 
</p>
<p>
	As he reached around the bottom frame again suddenly there was a click. Before he knew it the painting was falling...but it never hit the ground. 
</p>
<p>
	Sid winced at his dumb assery and stupid boi brain for making such a rookie dick mistake. But he looked around all was still quiet. Why hadn't he heard the crash. He looke down and saw the large frame of the painting surrounding him. 
</p>
<p>
  "Of course" he thought. "<b>A <a href="/daranos/items/portaltrait">PORTALTRAIT</a></b>"
</p>
<p>
  "<b>VERY GOOD MY YOUNG FRIEND</b>" a old voice came from the dark. "I assume you're hear for the festivities?"
</p>
<p>
	Sid remained quiet in the dark of the room. He could see no one. He slid his goggles off his eyes and strained to see through the darkness. But as soon as he thought he could see someone the room lit up with ghostly blue light. There before him were dozends of beings, monsters, <a href="/daranos/creatures/subdemon">sub demons</a>, <a href="/daranos/creatures/maindemon">main demons</a>, <a href="/daranos/creatures/orc">orcs</a>, <a href="/daranos/creatures/goblin">goblins</a>, <a href="/daranos/creatures/elf">elves</a>, and they were all TIT ASS FUCKIN NAKED. Sid was seeing more dong tit hanging in that moment than all his ancestors combined. Cool.
</p>
<p>
	In front of him sat a ghostly immaciated form of a wizard. An elf wizard who looked weak and old. Elves rarely if ever got old but this dude was so old his balls were hanging so low they were getting road rash. 
</p>
<p>
  "Welcome to the <b>ORGY MY FRIEND</b>" said the Wizard. And just as he did "Fuck the Pain Away" started playing from an <a href="/daranos/items/allseeball">all see ball</a> in the corner. This party was lit once again.
</p>
<p>
	Around the room Sid stared in amazement as he saw Orcs fucking Goblins. A Goblin fucking a <a href="/daranos/creatures/dogman">Dogman</a>. A <a href="/daranos/creatures/gelatinouscube">gelatinous cube</a> was slithering around. Within his milky translucency Sid could see that this cube had dozens of glory holes on his outer slime. Yeah. They were fuckin that cube.
</p>
<p>
	Orc babes were clappin cheaks so hard next to the wizard that Sid could feel it in his chest. The shear amount of booty bass thumpin was enough to wake the dead. Which it did. A <a href="/daranos/creatures/skeleman">skeleman</a> popped out of a coffin and began to do the robot across the room at which point he reached the gelatinous cube. His teeth chattered in excitement as he was devoured by the cube and turned into acid immediately. That dude was into some fucked up shit but hey who are we to judge?
</p>
<p>
	Elf babes were fuckin kissing so hard sparks flew off of their hard ass elf bodies. Or maybe they were wearing some Glitterdust. Two buff orcs were 69ing so hard they accidentally reinvented the wheel as they rolled 69 style across the room like an adult version of stick and wheel game which had only just been invented a few years ago.
</p>
<p>
	A dude was making out with a cursed sword in the corner. In another area a wizard was astral projecting. His astral form had like 12 damn hands and he was cranking off a dozen hot dudes and babes and non gendered beings. This duded was the Mozart of dicks. 
</p>
<p>
	The room begand to haze over with a cummy fog. The smell was unique. Like ozone and tomatoes. These ghosts were buck fuckin nasty and this orgy was going to go balls deep into the hot morning hours. You know like between 2am and 3am when the clock starts getting REAL fuckable? Oh my god I think I've been effected by this realm.
</p>
<p>
  "<b>ENOUGH</b>" Sid shouted. Everyone stopped thrusting and busting. 
</p>
<p>
	"Where is it?" Sid demaned to know. "Where is the Holy Viagrale"
</p>
<p>
	Everyone ereupted in naked laughter.
</p>
<p>
	"My boy" said the wizard. "That is just a myth. There is no such brew or cup or cock ring or even regular ring that maybe a small person could put on their cock as a cock ring?" 
</p>
<p>
	Sid glowered.
</p>
<p>
	"My boy" the wizard continued "I am the closest thing there is to a holy viagrale"
</p>
<p>
  The orgy cheered and began shout "<b><a href="/daranos/misc/jizzard">JIZZARD</a> JIZZZARD JIZZARD</b>"
</p>
<p>
	"But.."Sid stammered. "How?"
</p>
<p>
	"I am the last of an ancient sect of wizards who mastered the penile arts. Instead of using magic for more power I focused on using magic for fun...and boners."
</p>
<p>
	"What is this place?" Sid demaned to know.
</p>
<p>
	"My prison my young friend. But...as far as prisons go it could be worse. I mean look at this orc's bad ass back meat! Won't find that in the pain mines" he said as he slapped the butt as its jelly rippled and made the sound of clapping thunder.
</p>
<p>
	"How do we get out?" Sid asked.
</p>
<p>
	"Me? I don't" the jizzard replied. "But you...you can leave whenever you wish. We do not keep those here who do not wish to be here. And you my boy....your heart....it is out of cosmic alignment shall we say."
</p>
<p>
	"It is too late for me my boy. But thank you for visiting my orgy! Cum again soon! HA! Get it!?"
</p>
<p>
	The whole orgy began to laugh and slowly Sids vision faded. A moment later he awoke on the floor of the office. The painting hung once again on the wall.
</p>
<p>
	Sid rubbed his eyes. How long was he out? Someone surely would be here soon. He grabbed his pack and headed for the door but stopped mid stride.
</p>
<p>
	"Shit..." he said under his breath as he turned around back into the office, took the painting off the wall and headed out the door.
