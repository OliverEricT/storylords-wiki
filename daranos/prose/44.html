Ep 44

Dicks and Domanatrixes

All That Gunk Inside That Trunk

 "Whatchoo gonna do with all that Gunk? All that Gunk inside yo trunk?.

  I'mma git git git you drunk git you drunk on all my gunk

 Git you jizz drunk off my hump" Sang Peppercorn as the gang trudged their way southward toward the great desert.

"Imma git git git you"

"ENOUGH" shouted Sid as he rubbed his temlpes. "You've been singing that song for like 3 fucking weeks man!"

"Sorry, Sid it's just an earworm ya know?" Peppercorn said dejectedly.

Inside of Peppercorns ear a tiny little worm was tuning his violin and looked straight at the camera.

"What? We're really worms here. At least I'm not yelling at my emotionally abused son or waving a gun around. ITS A LIVING" said the ear worm as he counted down from 3.

"It's been on my All See Pod for weeks and I just can't help it. I mean look at this absolute unit of a Troll beauty who sings this song, Fergus Liciouis" Peppercorn held up the All See Pod for everyone to see. On it was a brick shit house of a troll with triple D's, an ass that could single handedly act as an aluminium can crusher in your dad's backyard during grilling season, and a back hump that would make Marty Feldman do a Triple Spit Take which is when you do a double take, a spit take, and also your peener does a spit take by 3ing.

"Ohhhh I get it" Fred said rolling his eyes.

"That's not a Quasimodo..." Chic said. "That's a FULL BLOWN MODO"

"We've been traveling for weeks and we can't seem to catch up to Gunk and that Hellcunt, Bitch Tits or whatever her name is" Fred said throwing a rock like superman into the vast dessert that stretched before them. It would later land in a forest area where a Mirkmonk would hear it thud against his tree house while he was trying to rekindle his sex life with his Mirkwife.

"GOD DAMMIT" The Mirkmonk said mid pump. He put on his bathrobe and hurriedly went out onto his front porch. He looked down to see a pretty big sized rock in terms of mirkmonk scale.

"Ahhh I see ya got rock problems there. Classic rock infestation" Jerry the Cardinal neighbor said shaking his head.

"Yeah, thanks Jerry very observant....ya fuckin putz" Said the Mirkmonk.

"Whatcha oughta do is get yourself a little spray bottle with some dish soap, some white wine vinegar, and scrote of newt. Mix that all together. Let it sit a spell. Then ya spritz that all around the tree there and boom! No more rocks" Jerry said lighting up a cigar he held in his wing.

"Yeah thanks Jerry I'll fucking kill you" said the Mirkmonk as he marched back into his tree house slamming the door on his way in.

"The problem..." Chic began to say. Yeah now wer're back at the main part of the story. Try and keep up. "The problem is we've been like trying to like coordinate our efforts with the Questing Team from the future. We'll like call them Team B for now...."

"Ugla is NO B TEAMER" Sid yelled. He would be damned if anyone called his lover a B teamer.

"Ok...sure...we'll be like...Team B" Chic said aquiessing. 

"LIKE FUCK WE ARE" Fred said throwing another rock into the dessert.

The faint yell of "OH FOR FUCK SAKE" could be heard hundreds of miles away.

"Ok...we'll like be Team Flamingo and they can be like...I dont know...Team Kitty Cat" Chic reasoned.

"MEW MEW MEW" Socks yelled in objection.

"OH. MY. GROB" Chic Pea said now rubbing her tiny temples.

"OK. We'll be Team Flamingo and they will be Team Sister Lover. Because Ugla is your sister Freddo and she's like your sweet lover that you never shut the hell up about, Sid"

"I don't know how I feel about that name..." Fred said wincing.

"I kind of like it" Peppercorn said smiling. "In fact...I REALLY like it."

Chic Pea took a solid 3 steps away from Peppercorn as everyone just looked at him in silence.

"So as I was saying. The problem is Team Flamingo is trying to coordinate our efforts with Team Sister Lover...." Chic Pea began to draw magical runes in power point form all around them.

"ehhhhh" Fred again shuttered physically from the name of Team B.

"We have to stop and guide them or draw some art or marker. I have to enchant it and protect it and its just slowing us down. Like, If this were the olden times we'd be fighting the Battle of Helmsdeep while Axewound would already be back at the Shire day drinking her PTSD's away. Ya follow me?"

"Yes" said everone in unicen. Their attention spans slightly better than your average 6th grader.

"What we need to do is think 4 dimensionally....." Chic Pea said drawing a tesseract. "Then we can simply have Team Sister Lover...."

"Ehhhhhhhh" Fred winced.

"We can simply have Team Sister Lover be at the location that we know Axewound will be in the future..." CHic Pea drew a line with Team Sister Lover jumping to a further point in time.

"Yes thats all well and good Chic but the problem is we can't reliably communicate with the Sister Lovers."

"EHHHHHHHH" Fred laid down into a fetal position.

"We need the Quantum Communicator to reliably be able to do that. If we had it we could realign our relative times and speak to the Sister Lovers...."

"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHH" Fred began to suck his thumb.

"...and speak to the Sister Lovers at a point in which they are further along in their relative timeline. Then they can find Axewound and do....something....." Peppercorn rubbed his head. "This is all so complicated. I miss when these stories were just Dogmen fucking each other out in the open...."

"So we're back at the beginning again." Sid said disappointely. "Team Flamingos still needs to be the ones who get the Quantum Communicator. We still need to find Axewound AND we need to rescue Gunk from the spell that Cuntress has on him" 

Sid looked out at the vast dessert that lay ahead. He sighed a deep dejected sigh. The sand was already getting into his ears. Traveling across such an expanse alone would be dangerous at best. Good thing he had Team Flamingos. Even though their party size would slow them down and that there was the whole problem to begin with. 2 steps forward 3 steps back. It was like fate had placed them at a wedding and they were dancing the Electric Slide. It was pointless and stupid and nobody wanted to be there.

----------------------------------

"Ohhhhh GUNKY MY HUNKY" Axewound yelled down a quiet stone hallway. As she exited her room she transformed herself into buxom and sturdy Ruby Rubbleborn, her secret identity for over a month now as she tried to coax the secrets of the Quantum Thingamajig out of Gunk.

"In here RUBLES" Gunk shouted back. Ruby looked down the hallway at like 73 different god damn doorways.

"Uh....Which here exactly, my dapper dwarf" Ruby said with an annoyed smile.

"Down the hall!" Gunk shouted.

Ruby let out a long sigh....

"Right side? Left Side? My wittle dumpling uh....dumpling sauce?" she trailed off trying to think of another sweet thing to say.

"Well which way are you coming from? Are you coming from the Kitchen?" Gunk shouted.

"JUST FUCKING COME OUT INTO THE HALL AND SHOW ME WHAT FUCKING ROOM YOU'RE IN! My uh....sweet baby mama's sweet baby boy?" she said adjusting her tone and her bodice.

Axewound had found an ancient secret dwarven fortress build into a BUTTE in the desert. It was completely hidden and had a fucking sick ass hidden door and everything. You should have seen them trying to get into the place man. They had to fight like a fuckin thousand haunted dwarven skelemen and then they had to fight this ancient evil that only Axewound knew how to defeat because she's also evil as fuck. She was all like BOOOM BLAT BLAT BLAT (Jet sounds)(machine gun sounds)(Awooooga). It was totally sick and you missed it. No wonder your mother comes to me for emotional and sexual comfort what with you being a huge disappointment and failure at every damn thing you get within restraining order distance to. You make me sick.

Gunk rolled backwards on his wheeled office throne out of the door way and gave Ruby a thumbs up. Ruby squinted to see he was at the very end of the hallway. She rolled her eyes and sighed. Her face reforming back to Axewound's for a split second. She focused and managed to change her face back. Good thing Gunk had already wheeled his way back into the room.

As Ruby entered she saw Gunk sitting at a great brass table with all sorts of tools and gizmos. Some Gunk had invented on his own and some he had found while scavenging the fortress after what was probably the coolest battle anyone had ever seen in Daranos. 

Gunk spun around in his chair. On his head was what looked like a collander with wires and all see ball's attached to it. He looked like Doc Brown but short.

"So uh...whatcha...whatcha doing there?" Axewound said trying to sound supportive.

"I'm trying to interface with this Quantum operating system. Think of it like a menu at a tavern that lets you operate the..."

"YES I KNOW WHAT AN OPERATING SYSTEM IS" Ruby shot back. She cleared her throat again. "My sweet love...I know you are tyring your best but if we dont figure out how to work this device I'm afraid...." Ruby stopped herself and feigned tears. She covered her mouth and let out a pathetic whimper. "I'm afraid the sickness that has overrun my hot dwarf body will take over and I'll....I'll......" She really let the crocodile tears flow. 

"Shh shh shh Ruby my love" Gunk stood up and held her. "We'll figure out what is draining your mana and we'll cure you of this ailment. I promise my thick hunk of dwarven bitch meat".

A little cultural reference: calling a dwarven woman a thick hunk of dwarven bitch meat is one of the most endearing and romantic things you can say to a brick shit house of a sturdy thick tree trunked legged crush a marble between those clappin cheeks ass having short queen make you scream 3 in yo dreams dwarf.

Ruby faked a slight petite little cough. 

"I just need to lay down my love" She said going over to a cot in the corner. Axewound wasn't lying about needing the Quantum Communicator's secrets. It had taken everything she had to remain disguised as Ruby Rubbleborn AND keep them hidden. Not to mention her jumping around in time. All this magic usage was taxing. Not fatal for her but if she couldn't figure out how to use the device her magical abilities would be put to the test. She for sure woudnl't be able to keep this ridiculous disguise. 

Ruby Rubbleborn, she thought to herself. What a stupid name. What a stupid dwarf Gunk was for buying into it. "Idiot" she thought as she lay back. She closed her eyes to the sound of zitting and zatting as Gunk worked even more tirelessly to find the secrets of the device.

Axewound awoke several hours later. The candles in the room were all dimmed. Gunk was no longer sitting at his seat working. She rubbed her eyes and groaned. But as she felt her face, her REAL face, panic set it. This was her face. Axewound's face. Her thin, totally never been magicaly altered perfect nose, her high cheek bones,  and her perfectly symetrical face that once made The Devil himself cream his jean shorts with nothing but a sly wink.

"Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck" She said soflty.

"Ruby. I made you some soup. It has chicken feet and barely has any nails in it this time" Gunk said as he approached the door.

Axewound shot up and magically locked the door with a spell.

"Oh tha...thank you sweetums" She said but in her Axewound voice.

"Do you feel alright Ruby? You sound a bit...taller" Gunk asked.

"No I'm (cough cough) I'm fine and still very short" She said adjusting her tone kind of not remember the voice she gave Ruby. I mean who does that? Who makes a character and forgets what they sound like halfway through a story? Very unprofessional.

"Maybe...." Gunk said lowering his head. "Maybe we need to consider...Plan B"

"I told you I don't need any Plan B I have a spell that takes care of all that" Axewound said.

"No no not that." Gunk put his forehead against the door. "The last resort plan that we had talked about..."

Axewound, for a split second, reached out to touch the door but then stopped herself. 

"We...we talked about what that could mean Gunk" She said very seriously.

"I know but...I dont want to live if you aren't here, Ruby" Gunk said as a single tear rolled down his cheek onto the door. As it did the magical spell that Axewound had used to lock the door faded away. Axewound reached for the door knob and pulled the door open. There, standing before him, was his love Ruby Rubbleborn.

"Ok Gunky...lets do it" Ruby said.

Deep in the bowels of the dwarven fortress Axewound had set up her own workshop. Maybe a better name for it would be her "Twerkshop".

All along the walls were whips, chains, handcuffs, paddles, slut spankers, riding crops, dick wankers, clit clampers, and tit tampers. There was a stockade. There was what looked like a jungle gym but it was just all sexual torture devices. There was a device called The Rack which would hold you in place by just your tits. You'd be then bent forward at a 45 degree angle so that your feet could be tickled with any number of differing types of feathers.

Gunk walked in blindfolded as Ruby led him by the hand.

"Why am I blindfolded Ruby?" Gunk asked totally validly.

"The ritual requires you to be." Ruby said completely making that up out of her finely toned ass.

Ruby then pulled out a pair of fuzzy shackles and shackled Gunk's hands together.

"Part of the ritual..." She said before he could ask agian.

Ruby then led Gunk to the stockade and placed him inside. She even gave him a little apple box to stand on so he'd be more comfortable....for now.

As the stocks closed around Gunk, Ruby transformed back into Axewound. She let out a sigh of relief. She even had on a crop topped off the shoulder of the free T Shirt you get if you surivive Club Vandersexxx. Amsterdams number 3 best rated sodomy bar and anal experience.

"So...this will get your mana back for good or like for how long?" Gunk said beginning to get nervous and excited. 

"Sure lets go with that" Axewound said no longer even trying to change her voice.

She spun a paddled in one hand and clapped it against her other. The loud SMACK made Gunk jump a little. This again made him a little more nervous and a little more excited.

"Once I complete the ritual I'll gain all of your knowledge. I will know what you know. I will possess your skill and your soul...." She said whispering into Gunk's ear.

The words were like hot fudge on his ice cream brain. His eyes rolled back into his head and he was completely enthralled. Axewound wound up for a swing like she was Bryce Harper GO PHILS. She released the paddle and it smacked Gunk right on his cheeks.

"Ouch" He said giggling. Axewound's eyes narrowed. She wound up again this time swinging out her left leg like she was trying to hit one over toward Geno's steaks. She shifted her weight and SLAP.

The crack of the paddled caused a shockwave that broke nearly everything made of glass in the room save for the glass buttplugs. Those things are sturdy. OR SO I HEAR. I WAS TOLD THIS....BY A GUY....WHO ISN'T ME.....NAMED.....BOSH.....BENDERMAN.

Magical golden mana started to flow from Gunk. Axewound threw her head back in extacy. Her dark raven hair whipping around her perfectly symetrical face that made the devil cum his jorts or whatever I said earlier. She absorbed the golden knowledge and smiled a whicked smile.

Gunk was in heaven. He hand't been spanked like this since Dwarf Scouts.

Axewound moved him to the The Rack. She chained Gunk up with indestructable adamantine chains that were attached to his 2 golden nipple rings. Yeah. Gunk was fun in college.

She hoisted him up with all his weight held up by his burly and leathery man nips. As he was lifted up more golden mana flowed into his pantaloons.

Axewound was now cackling. Yelling laughter like when that one girl at the party gets so drunk she just is yelling stuff? But she's also having a great time.

Axewound plucked a phoenix feather off the rack and began to tickle Gunk's feet. His hairy toesies twitched as he giggled. The mana was flowing hot and strong now. Axewound reached out to the etheral goo and began to rub it all over her face. She licked her fingers of it like she had just eaten Buffalo Wild Wings.

Gunk squeeled like a pig. Axewound didn't even have to tell him to he just did it. Gunk was REALLY FUN in college.

Axewound then took him to the jungle gym and bent this boy like a pretzel. She used the tit tampers on him to flatten out his tough leathery jerky man tiddies. She cracked the riding crop across his bare butt and across his bare feet. She slapped him across the mouth and then spit into it returing some of the mana to him only for it to pour back out and Axewound to lap it up again like a good bitch. I want you to know that at this point I'm wondering how far I should take this. I'm very aware of what is going on right now and I'm sorry if you have a boner. Just know that this could be much....MUCH WORSE (hotter).

Axewound was now full blown horny super saiyan 4. She screamed and laughed. Golden mana was flowing all over the place. She looked down and saw Gunk had passed out from pleasure and/or pain. Whats the difference am I right?

Suddenly a large explosion rocked the entire fortress.

"Shit...they've found me!" Axewound shouted. The ritual was now disrupted but she had enough mana and knowledge from Gunk to make the device work. She quickly dropped her riding crop and made her way to the door up to the workshop room to grab the quantum communicator but as she did Gunk grabbed her hand.

"I...I love you....My queen....Queen.....Axewound...." he said as he passed out again.

Axewound stopped. She felt his life slipping away. She held his hand in hers. His little rough hand. She saw the creases and imperfections in it. Unlike her hands that had never once done a hard days work unless you count this as hard work. She felt something....something looking at Gunk's face....

"Oh for FUCK SAKES" she said sighing. "Come on Gunky....we need to get you out of here."

"But...but the quantum...thing....you....need ....." he passed out again.

"We don't need it she said" as she opened a golden portal and carried Gunk through.

------------------------------------------

As The Flamingos entered the the dungeon the shear magical energy almost knocked Chic Pea backwards.

"Whoa like....whoooo boy" She said. "Blackus Lightus Crimescenus Shinus" she said as her staff lit up with the blazing LED black light.

All around them were the remnants of mana. On the windows. On the walls. Even dripping down 2 round balls which was a scultpure of the Daranosian moons.

"MY GOD" Fred said gagging. "This place looks like your mom's house after I'm done having my way with her after she finally divorced your dad and sent you away to Dwarf Scout Camp for the summer"

"This place looks like Club Shampoo after MILF Night and their cleaning crew is on strike and also the garden house they use to rinse off the entire building is all kinked up and won't let the water come out so they just said 'fuck it' and let the morning crew deal with it" Chic said.

"Yeah this place looks like someone jizzed a lot and then...and then said 'hey why don't we just let it sit here for these guys to find' and then they were like 'oh man lets totally do that' and they...they did that and then we....like found it like this and its totally gross....right....right guys" Peppercorn tried.

"What the Deliverence Ass FUCK happened here, Chic" Sid said trying not to touch anything.

"Axewound....she's a Sexcromancer. She must have done a ritual to get some of her power back. I'm not fully versed in the art so I can only speculate."

"We should take some to study"  Peppercorn said with a bit of a too wide smile.

Fred gagged. "NOPE" he said and dry heaved out of the room.

Chic Pea reached into her pack and grabbed an empty potion vile. She held her staff up to find the highest concentration of mana.

"Ugh....smells like....tomatos" she said as she slithered some of the mana into the vile.

Just then the mana began to fade. Chic Pea looked at her staff and shook it thinking the black light was extinguishing but it shined brightly on. The mana began to coalesce into a dark thick cream in the middle of the room.

"It's draining itself!" Sid yelled. In the middle of the room he saw a drain that was probably totally normal and not used for fucked up shit AT ALL.

"NOOOOOOPE" Fred yelled from outside the room and dry heaved some more.

Then with a flushing of the toilet sound the mana was gone.

"Did you get some?" Sid yelled over to Chic.

"Yeah..." She shook the vile and the mana glowed golden inside of it still.

Meanwhile deep below the surface Scrabbles Dant and the Red Ant Queen were making their way alongside of a fiery ridge. Molten magma flowed beneath them where that other ant guy had fallen and give Scrabbles his cold steel axe.  Suddenly a giant dick shaped stalactite began to ungulate. After about 30 seconds (which is record I might add) it exploded with creamy mana. The mana fell and fell into the lake of lava below.

"Smells like roasted tomatos" Dant said.

"What the fuck was that?" The Red Queen asked.

FIN
