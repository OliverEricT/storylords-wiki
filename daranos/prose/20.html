	EP 20
</p>
<p>
	Butt Babies
</p>
<p>
		The realm of Daranos can make you rich or it can make you a BITCH. It's kill or be killed out there. Like a Game of Thrones episode during the midrun of the show when it was good and The Hound was just going around killing who the fuck ever and then the show got bad and someone got fired probably for no reason. Wait what was I talking about? Oh right Daranos. This place is either gonna make you 3 your jeans or 2 yourself when your corpse hits the ground and all the poop in your butt flies out of your body because you have no muscle control anymore as your brain signals dim out into the great void.
</p>
<p>
	But all around there is magic. Like when you eat a peanut butter sandwich and the rest of the day you smell peanut butter. Or like mustard if you  had a hot dog and it got on your hand. They don't make water hot enough to get rid of that smell. Even in the smallest of creatures magic can be found. Heros of all sizes mostly going unnoticed by the hustle and bustle of everyday life.
</p>
<p>
	"DARICK" yelled a matronly voice from across the woods.
</p>
<p>
	"Darick its time for supper sweatheart!"
</p>
<p>
	Dropping an acorn Darick the Mirkmonk scurried across a fallen log and did a front flip off of it landing on his feat. In his hand he waved a small stick.
</p>
<p>
	"AVAST YE Uh....SCALLIWAG BARNICLES...yeah thats it. AVAST YOU WILL NEVER GET MY NUTS" Darick said as he parried and riposted against his imaginary foe. With a final thrust he slew his adversary and raised his acorn above his head in triumph.
</p>
<p>
	"DARICK COME ON SWEETY BABY CAKES MAMAS BABY BOY" his mother yelled again.
</p>
<p>
	The birds above chirped and sang like some kind of lame ass Disney film as Darick scurried his way home. He climbed the tree he had known as his home his entire life and saw his father sitting on the porch smoking a tiny pipe of Daranosian Doob.
</p>
<p>
	"Are ya winnin son?" His father asked as he Darick hurried through the little wooden door on the side of the tree.
</p>
<p>
	"I killed a pirate and then found an acorn. I'll have to go back and get it tomorrow. I'm ready to help out with the nut gathering this year papa" He said enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>
	"Well I dont know if you're ready for THAT much responsibility but I'm sure your mother and I can find something for you to do to help out."
</p>
<p>
	Darick nodded then headed into the tiny mirkmonk sized bathroom to wash his paws in the tiny mirkmonk size sink. Yeah Mirkmonks invented running water. You dont think they could? The fuckin Romans had all kinds of shit like running water and even vending machines and those fuckers thought sticking a banana peel up your cooter would prevent pregnancy. Maybe they thought that the jizz would slip on the peel on his way up to the uterus? Either way do not stick a banana peel up any hole in your body. It can cause sepsis and you will smell like a bag of old unwanted halloween candy.
</p>
<p>
	"Mom...did you ever have that 'I stuck banana peel up my cooter' feeling" A commercial on the all see ball said as Darick entered the living room. His mother was in the kitchen cooking Acorn cobs, Daricks favorite summer treat.
</p>
<p>
	Soon the family of 3 was sitting around the tiny table monching hard on their tiny food.
</p>
<p>
	"Darick I'm going to need you to go into town tomorrow and sell some of these acorns for other acorns" his mom said. "Your father and I know how much you want to help out with things around here and since acorns are both what we eat and our money we figured it wouldn't be too confusing for your little kid brain"
</p>
<p>
	"Aw jee mom tomorrow?" Darick said rolling his eyes. "I was going to head over to Wet Log Barracks with Squeeks to watch the Mirk Knights practice fighting."
</p>
<p>
	"Darick" his father said patting him on the back. "You said you wanted to help. If you ever want to be a Mirk Knight you must first learn to help your parents. Do what your mother says so I don't have to hear about it later"
</p>
<p>
	That night, as Darick lay in his straw bed, he dreamt of riches and bitches. He dreamt of being a world famous knight covered in gold and jewels as mirkmonk ladies bathed him and picked lice off of  his golden red fur. 
</p>
<p>
	"Fuck I'm gonan be so cool" he murmered in his sleep and then he  probably had a wet dream or at least woke up with his tail as rigid as Silver Bridge right before it collapsed. Too soon? Sure hope a Hat Man doesn't visit me tonight....(narrator slowly unzips pants).
</p>
<p>
	The next day Darick awoke to the sound of those damn birds chirping and it was magical as all fuckin shit. He grabbed his favorite stick and cloak made out of an old piece of a Paladins cloak and headed into the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
	"Remember Darick" his mother warned. "Trade these acorns for money acorns. Don't let them swindle you and watch out for rats. If you see a rat run straight home"
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah yeah ma I got it." He sighed and then swung his stick around pretending to fight a rat.
</p>
<p>
	As Darick made his way out to the porch his father was already sittiing out on his chair relaxing sipping on his acorn coffee.
</p>
<p>
	"Good luck, son" he said proudly. With only a knod Darick scurried down the tree off on his first adventure.
</p>
<p>
	"They grow up so fast..." his father said to himself. Just then the annoying neighbor Clarence started up his moss mower and began to mow.
</p>
<p>
	"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD CLARENCE IT'S 7am ON A SKATURDAY. CAN YOU AT LEAST WAIT UNTIL MY MORNING WOOD GOES DOWN BEFORE YOU START MOWING YOUR DAMN PRECIOUS MOSS? FUCK CLARENCE SOMEONE COULD BE TRYING TO RECORD A PODCAST RIGHT THIS VERY MOMENT! HAVE A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE YA DANG NUTLESS FOOL FUCK"
</p>
<p>
	Darick quickly made his way to a trail that was used by the humans and followed carefully along side of it. He whistled joyfully as he saw the edge of Grall upahead. There he would trade in his acorns for other money acorns. If you think that that concept is ridulous, think about what it is you do for a living. You're doing an imaginary job for an imaginary non physical number that you use to pay imaginary bills with. Yeah...think about it. I dare you, you won't do it.
</p>
<p>
	"HEY DARICK" a friendly voice rang through the woods and nearly scared the piss, poop, and jizz out of him. 
</p>
<p>
	"Oh hey Squeek" Darick said composing himself. Squeek was his best friend. She was smaller than Darick and wore a newsboy hat that fell off of a Blargbie doll. She was a bit of a tom boy but she was always there for Darick.
</p>
<p>
	"Going to the market for your mom huh" She said as she let out a whistled. "I'm impressed."
</p>
<p>
	"yeah wanna come with? Then we can go watch the mirkknights"
</p>
<p>
	"Nah I can't I'm  not allowed into Graal yet." She said disappointed. "My mom says its and I quote 'if Lost Vegas had a baby with the red light distritct and and open relationship with a sewage plant and they had a butt baby but they didn't know who the father was, the sewage plant or the red light district'. Whatever that means" she trailed off.
</p>
<p>
	Just then a glint of something hit Daricks eye. 
</p>
<p>
	"Look over there Squeek" he said pointing off into the woods. The two rushed over and cleared a way through the brush. 
</p>
<p>
	"Whoaaa" Squeek said shocked. "What IS that?"
</p>
<p>
	"I dont know its like some kind of gem...."
</p>
<p>
	There before them stood a bright red ruby the size of a tennis ball.
</p>
<p>
	"Do you know how RICH we are?" Darick said grabbing Squeek and hugging her.
</p>
<p>
	"We can be knights and we can swashbuckle and you can pick lice off of me...."
</p>
<p>
	"Wait what?" Squeek said stopping him mid hug.
</p>
<p>
	"Nothing nothing forget it" he stammerd covering his ass quickly  "We can sell this at the market in and be wealthy!"
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah but..." Squeek looked down. "I can't go to the market with you...remember? The butt baby and the red light district and yada yada?"
</p>
<p>
	"It's ok Squeek." Darick said reassuring her. "I'll go and I'll come back home and we'll be rich and famous......and then we can get mirkmarried" He said that last part  under his breath.
</p>
<p>
	"What was that last part?" Squeek said with a smile.
</p>
<p>
	"Nothing nothing I just....uh....farted really loudly and it sounded like I said something but I better go now because of how bad the fart smells. I'd hate for you to have to smell this totally real not made up fart that I just farted right out of my butt and it was so gnarly that it sounded like I said I wanted to marry you...."
</p>
<p>
	"Ok" she said shaking her head. "But be careful. Don't let any butt babies get you" she said giving him a kiss on the cheek.
</p>
<p>
	Darick turned turned bright red. He picked up the gem and carried it as best as he could but this thing was HUGE. Not wanting to look stupid he pretended that it was 'aint no thang' to carry it in front of Squeek. 
</p>
<p>
	"Yup good thing I do 4000 tree ups a day" he said faking confidence. "This ain't  no thang as they say"
</p>
<p>
	Soon Darick made his way to the outskirts of Graal. All around were merchants and beggars and even a dogman was humping another dogman.
</p>
<p>
	"Watch out for butt babies" Darick said to himself.
</p>
<p>
	"HEY YOU THERE!" A voice shouted. "YOU WITH THE GEM"
</p>
<p>
	Darick looked around but saw no one. 
</p>
<p>
	"DOWN HERE BOY" the voice said. Looking down Darick finally saw 2 yellow beady eyes in a sewer grate. He couldn't make out anything other than those peircing eyes.
</p>
<p>
	"Uhhhh I'm  not suppose to talk to strangers" Darick said reluctantly as he slowly moved away from the grate.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm not stranger my boy! I'm a...coinnoiser of fine jewels....yeah that's it. And I see you have yourself a WHOPPER of a doozy of a gem."
</p>
<p>
	Darick instinctively held tighter onto his treasure. 
</p>
<p>
	"I'm going to sell this at the Mirkmarket inside the city so I can be a knight marry my friend who doesn't know I love her but I secretly do"
</p>
<p>
	"Whoa a man who knows what he wants and the drive to achieve his goals" the yellow eyed stranger said. "Say...hows abouts I sell that gem for you, for a small fee, and you don't even have to go into the city"
</p>
<p>
	"I dont know mister" Darick said. "I have to go in anyway to trade these acorns...."
</p>
<p>
	"ACORNS I LOVE ACORNS" the man shouted. "Acorn on the cob....my favorite dish"
</p>
<p>
	"ME TOO" Darick said excitedly not noticing that he was now moving closer to the man in the grate.
</p>
<p>
	"Say...I'll take a look at this gem and then you tell me where you live and I'll hand deliver the acorns to you myself."
</p>
<p>
	"Ok" Darick relented "But first I have to ask...are you a butt baby?"
</p>
<p>
	"A what" The man said "What kind of weird ass little kid ass question is that? I mean...no no I'm not. I'm just a trustworthy jewelsmith who loves jewels and making fair and totally legitimate deals  with children in a NON creepy way. Nope...nothing creepy here move along officer" He finished with a nervouse chuckle.
</p>
<p>
	"Well ok here" Darick slowly began to place the gem into the sewer.
</p>
<p>
	"NOW BOYS" shouted the yellow eyes. Just then a dozen spiders swarmed around Darick and the jewel. Darick one'd his pants as fast as a virgin 3's himself on prom night after adry hump sesh on the laundry room floor. The spiders crackling mandibles chittered against the jewel as they tried to gain purchase of the gem. Darick tried to use his stick to fight them off but it was too late. The lead spider shot hot white webbing out of his butt hole thingy and began to wrap up Darick in a caccoon of warm sticky death. His voice was muffled by the silk of the web as he shouted for Squeek or the PODS or ANYONE. Even though the streets were bustling nobody took notice of what went on beneath their feet. To them it j ust looked like a bunch of spiders had pissed off a mirkmonk.
</p>
<p>
	As Darick's screams got quieter and quieter Yellow Eyes sank back into the sewers until it was deathly silent, the only thing that could be heard was the noise of commerce around the square.
</p>
<p>
	"MR. SIR MONK" Squeek shouted as she ran up the Darick's tree house. "MR SIR MONK DARICK....HE'S IN TROUBLE" She panted as she readched porch.
</p>
<p>
	"Slow down Squeek" Darick's father said. "What happened? Tell me everything."
</p>
<p>
	Squeek told Darick's father everything. About  how Darick and she had found a giant gem and how he was going to go to Graal to sell it. About how there are butt babies in Graal and how Darick had farted so henously that it made it sound like he said he would marry her and how unchecked gastro intestinal issues can lead to severe buttitis or at the very least, severe stank butt. After hearing all this Darick's father turned to Darick's mother...
</p>
<p>
	"Wife.....get me my sword"
</p>
<p>
	Then there was a montage of Darick's father suiting up  like in an Edgar Wright film with quick zooms and cuts. He grabbed his sword "Silk Ripper" which was just a dominant side of a half of a scissors. It was named Silk Ripper because of the ease of which it cut through silk. Either that or it was named as such because of all the silk panties it ruined after hot mirkbabes saw it. I guess thten it'd be calleld "Silk Moistener" or like "Silk Wettener" or something. Either way chicks lost gallons lookin at this thing.
</p>
<p>
	Darick's father made his way to the Mirk Knighht Barracks loaded up in full Mirk Knight armor.
</p>
<p>
	"Captain?" Said one of the cadets immediately saluting.
</p>
<p>
	"Captain I thought you had retired?" 
</p>
<p>
	"My son is in trouble. I need a mount. NOW CADET" Said the Darick's Father. He was once  a Captain of this guard and well respected. Probably explains why he doesn't do anything all day except yell at hooligans.
</p>
<p>
	"Sir...I'm sorry but the crow brigade is on maneuvers this weekend" The cadet said. "But if you hurry you can catch them. They're training near Bone Down Bluff."
</p>
<p>
	The Captain quickly turned as the cadet saluted.
</p>
<p>
	Soon the Captain found the Crow Brigade training grounds. All around were humans and Orcs and every big type of person making out. This was Bone Down Bluff and a perfect place for the Crow Brigade to fly around on the backs of their crows and steal shiny objects from the big people as they poured fluids into each others orafaces.
</p>
<p>
	"Luetenant!?" The Captain commanded.
</p>
<p>
	"Captain? What...what are you doin ghere?"
</p>
<p>
	"I need a steed NOW" the captain barked.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm sorry sir but I can't. They've just taken off to find shinies" the Luetenant stammered.
</p>
<p>
	"Hey bro you looking for a mount?" A booming human voice said.
</p>
<p>
	"AHHHHH CHEESE IT WE'RE SEEN" the Leutenant said as he pissed pants and ran away.
</p>
<p>
	"Who said that?" The captain swung around sword at the ready.
</p>
<p>
	"Up here little guy"
</p>
<p>
	The Captain looked up to see a human male looking down at him. On his arm was what the humans would call a TOP CHOICE HOTTIE PATOTTIE with a BOOTY YOU'D WANNA SHOOTY ON WITH YOUR 3 HOSE. 
</p>
<p>
	"You...you can understand me" The captain questioned looking up at this giant of a man.
</p>
<p>
	"Sure I can" The boy said. "I'm a druid. We talk to everyone in nature. Name's Jimmy by the way." The human held out his finger and the Captain grabbed it and shook. Jimmy laughed as his date began to chew gum and do her make up in a small hand held all see ball.
</p>
<p>
	"So...why the urgency for a mount?" Jimmy asked.
</p>
<p>
	The captain went on to tell Jimmy what had happened to his son and how he had been captured by butt babies and how his son had farted a fart so legendary it was like his butt was speaking NAY his butt was channeling the gods themselves.
</p>
<p>
	Jimmy rubbed his chin and without hesitation blew a whistle so magical and musical that if humans could hear it it would solve all of our problems. Kids would no longer go hungry and the ice caps would refreeze but this time into the shapes of butts and dicks and tits for all generations to marvel over. After he was done a Fire Falcon screeched its way through the twilight clouds, it's red fiery feathers blazing through the night. It landed next to the Captain and nuzzled up against his cute mirkmonk chin.
</p>
<p>
	"This is Screech" Jimmy said. "He's a long time friend. Now he will serve you in your time of need. He is now your friend. Take care of him" With that the Captain mounted Screech and blazed off into the darkening skies. 
</p>
<p>
	"Now where were we baby" Jimmy said as he used the same finger he shooks the captains hand with to go backc to fingering his date.
</p>
<p>
	Screech landed in the market outside of Graal with a SKREEEEEEE. The market was all but empty has shop owners and flea marketeers all had packed up for the day. A single tumbleweed blew by so you the audience know that it was empty and quiet. I have to put stuff like that in these stories because most people in the fly overs don't get the subtlety of my stories. I literallly have to finger bang them with information. I mean how droll.
</p>
<p>
	Screech nugded the Captain as he looked over toward the sewer grate. There on the ground was a tattered old piece of a POD's cloak. 
</p>
<p>
	"Darick" the Captain said running over to it. He picked it up and smelled trying to pick up the scent of his son.
</p>
<p>
	"EW" he said. "Why does my hand smell like a caeser salad?" He put the piece of the cloak into his belt and unsheathed Silk Ripper. He then patted Screech on his beak and said "Stay here friend...we may need a hastey exit". With that the Captain entered the sewers to save his son.
</p>
<p>
	"PLACE THE GEM ONTO THE PEDASTAL OF POWER" Yellow Eyes said. His eyes gleaned a bright sickly yellow like piss on a hot summer morning after a night of drinking tequila and possibly other people's piss? Who knows what was in that bottle Jeremy brought over. Classic Jeremy.
</p>
<p>
	"Sir...what are we going to do with this gem again?" said a rat underling
</p>
<p>
	"YOU IDIOT" Yellow eyes said as he slapped the taste out of his underling's mouth so hard his mama felt it. Did you know she always was so stupid she put lipstick on her forehead just to make up her mind?
</p>
<p>
	As Yellow Eyes stepped forward into the light all could see his glorious abismalness. On him clung a torn Napoleonic coat. His rat face was scarred and mutilated by battle but where his legs should be was only the thorax of a spider. 
</p>
<p>
	"Sorry General Ratsolov" the rat underling said.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah put it...no....move it closer to the yeah....the strairs yeah. Don't hit the chandelier with it....ok stop!" The General directed his troops to move the gem with the precision only a half rat half spider general could. All around spiders and rats were feasting on the bones of pidgeons and bug parts and like whatever the fuck else rats eat. People? Who knows.
</p>
<p>
	In a cage hanging over a cooking flame Darick sat huddled in the corner trying to avoid the heat. General Ratsolov lurched over to the cage. His lower body seemingly moving faster than his upper body was used to. He ran one of his chitanous legs across the bars of the cage. The ringing from the bars startled Darick as he looked up with tears in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
	"Why...why are you keeping me here just take the gem and let me go" Darick pleaded.
</p>
<p>
	"Why? WHY?" the General began to laugh like a maniac. "BECAUSE WE'RE RATS! WE DO WHAT WE WANT AND PISS OFF WHOEVER WE WANT" With this the entire room of rats began to cheer. The spiders chittered in agreemant.
</p>
<p>
	"And with our new Spider Brethran we will defeat ALL OF OUR NEMESISES....NEMISI?  NEMASAUCES? What is ther plural of that work?"
</p>
<p>
	"We love you GENERAL!" Shouted a fanboy rat from the back. The general did a wink and a finger guns with his spider leg.
</p>
<p>
	"Those frogs think they are so smart...." He went on with no context or prompting whatsoever to this topic. Like a Trumper who just NEEEDS to let everyone know that NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT. ATTENTION EVERYONE GRANDPA HAS SOMETHING TO SAY! EVERYONE STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND LISTEN TO THIS GUY. GIVE HIM HIS PLATFORM PLEASE RESPECT HIS UNVACCINATED OPINIONS!
</p>
<p>
	"And if pissing off the Mirkmonks is the price we  have to pay for keeping this priceless gem then so be it. We'll GO TO WAR WITH THEM TOO!" As he finished the room roared with applause. Darick sank back down into a fetal  position and cried for his father.
</p>
<p>
	Above the cage the Captain was pearing into the room through a hole in a pipe. He was furious with adorable rage. He could hear hot mirkmonk blood pumping in his ears. He gripped SIlk Ripper and gritted his teeth. With a rush of adrenaline he leapt from the pipe above and with a single swing cut through the chain holding up Darick's cage. He then used his momentum and other hand to swing the cage out of the way of the fire below. Darick hit the ground with a clang and the cage broke open.
</p>
<p>
	"That's my son you butt baby!" He said as he super hero landed in front of Darick.
</p>
<p>
	"Look boys OUR FIRST MIRKKNIGHT" The General said laughing. "KILL HIM" 
</p>
<p>
	With that spider and rat alike crowded around the Captain like that scene from Kill Bill with the  Crazy 88's. He held is sword up and saw in the  reflection behind him that he was surrounded. Good thing he came here to kill kidnappers and chew acorns....and looks like hee was all out of acorns. With a slash he cleaved a rat underling in twain. The two halves of his body slowly slid apart as the viscosity of his innards gave way. As they hit the ground a spray of blood shot out and covered everything in rat blood. After that a spider leapt from high above him but the Captain dodged artfully out of the way. With a single round house kick he booted the spider into the fire. It popped and hissed as its exoskeleton began to heat up and boil the spider from the inside. This caused a nearby rat guy to puke and die from heart attack. 
</p>
<p>
	"Anyone else?" The Captain said smuggly smiling through a face full of red rat blood. Darick took cover behind a pipe as his father cut his way through everything that didn't have a poofy tail. With a clang his father held up a rat off the ground with one hand. As the Captain squeezed the rat's neck Darick could see his eyes bulging out of his skull until his father's grip caused the rat's head to explode.
</p>
<p>
	"HOLY SHIT" The General said sitting on his throne eating Acorn on the cob. "WHOA" he would say as the butter was dribbling down his rat face. As he watched his minions being torn apart by the cutest hero since  Buffcat. Trademark Daranos all Rights reserved.
</p>
<p>
	"You'll never get my gem" The General shouted.
</p>
<p>
	"I dont want your gem" Shouted the Captain. "Besides" the captain looked over mid kill to see a giant red gem. "That's just a bunch of melted lollipops that got stuck together. Probably from some kids out in the woods eating candy"
</p>
<p>
	"What?...No no...its a ruby" The General said doubling down. "Look it has ruby sticks in it"
</p>
<p>
	"Ruby sticks?" The captain squinted 
</p>
<p>
	"yeah real  rubies have these white stick things in them. Its how you know quality rubies are real....right? Am ...am I right? right guys?" The Gneral said looking around for validation.
</p>
<p>
	Just then the ground began to rumble. Off in the distance a loud war horn bellowed.
</p>
<p>
	"CHARRRRGE" shouted a Frog as the sewer was flooded with Frog Warriors. 
</p>
<p>
	"OH SHIT THE FROGS" The General said "Where's my gun?!"
</p>
<p>
	The chaos of battle was the perfect opportunity for the Captain to grab his son and with a jedi leap leap into the broken pipe and to freedom. As they exited he saw the General with a rat sized gun just blowing frogs away.
</p>
<p>
	"Where the fuck did he get a rat sized gun from?" Darick thought to himself.
</p>
<p>
	The next day Darick awoke to Squeek sitting beside his bed. He had been through heck but he had survived the butt babies. 
</p>
<p>
	"Squeek...." he said weakly. "Your mom was...she was right"
</p>
<p>
	"Shh shh" she soothed him. "You need rest" she patted his  head and began to step out of the room. As she reached the door she looked back at her friend once more. 
</p>
<p>
	"I'm gonna marry you Squeekaleek McMirkenstien" he said quietly in his sleep and then let out the loudest fart anyone had ever heard.
</p>
<p>
	"THE FUCK IS GOING ON IN THERE" the Captain yelled from the porch.
</p>
<p>
	The ENd.
</p>
