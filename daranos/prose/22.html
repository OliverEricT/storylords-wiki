	EP 22 Debts and Breakups
</p>
<p>
	Smother's Day
</p>
<p>
	8 Year Ago
</p>
<p>
	Ah the holidays in Daranos. Wait? It's not the holidays in the real world right now? But I wrote this idea down when it was the holidays and it was supposed to be the holidays in the episode. Well shit. I'm going to have to talk to my agent about these prompts. Hello, Jerry? Yeah its me. I can't work like this. Tell them...NO Jerry listen, tell them I need prompts that match with my story ideas. I DONT KNOW JERRY MAKE IT HAPPEN.....ok....ok you're right. Fired you say? Well shit.....
</p>
<p>
	Ah the lesser known holidays in Daranos also know as Greeting Card Holidays in the realm of the real. Smother's Day, like a soggy MILF yearning to be set free, comes only once a year. And just like banging that MILF, it is a holiday best spent with others. Preferably more than 3 but under 6 as that gets confusing as to who is filling up who/who gets gifts for who. SORRY who is filling up WHOM.
</p>
<p>
	"AVAST! LOOK HARDY THERE BOYS" Clarence the talking Clam Pirate said while holding a dulled butter knife shaped like a sword in his clam mouth. "We must be takin this bootie for its smothers day and I plan on smotherin me mommy in booty!" He shouted as he his men, who were just regular ass pirates starting unloading gold and candlesticks and paintings and all sorts of loot off of a treasure barge which was making its way into Graal Harbor.
</p>
<p>
	"Uh boss" Said his first mate Squiggles. "Boss you might want to watch the phrasing on that" he warned as the rest of the crew laughed at the not so subtle double entandre. 
</p>
<p>
	"MY MOTHER IS A SAINT" Clarence shouted. "And if'n she wishes me to have carnal relations with her on this day of celebration so be it!"
</p>
<p>
	"Oh god" a pirate cried in the background as everyone else was like "EWWWW"
</p>
<p>
	"Its ok lads" Clarence began to clarify. "She's me step mum and one time she got stuck in the All Dry Machine.'
</p>
<p>
	"OHHHHHH ok well then thats a different story" the pirates all said to various degrees and continued to loot the barge. Keep in mind that this dude is a literal talking clam and he's talking about Game of Thronesing his step mom on Smother's Day. As a wise man once said "This is a bad episode"
</p>
<p>
	"Nobody's fucking their step moms today boys" a voice from atop the sails suddenly said with all the confidence of someone who actually fucked their step mom once. With a spin of his dagger Sid stabbed the sail and slid downward ripping the sail like he ripped your step mom's well you get the idea...
</p>
<p>
	"SID THE ROGUE" Clarence said unsurprised. "GET HIM BOYS"
</p>
<p>
	Dozens of pirates began to pour out of the ships hold dropping their loot with a clang on the salted wooden deck. Their rage more so having to do with now moving this loot was going to take longer and not so much that some random Troll was interrupting them. Kind of like when your friend asks you to move and then wants to stop to eat lunch. Like...lets pull this band aid off my man. Also this is the only time I'm helping you move bro. Next time you can ask my agent Jerry.
</p>
<p>
	"Not so fast gentelmen" a voice boomed from out of the ether. In a blaze of fiery magic Ugla stepped out of a portal onto the deck of the barge.
</p>
<p>
	"AHHHH FUCK AHHHHH" Yelled a pirate as the edge of the portal translocated directling onto his right side. His arm vaporized in an instant leaving his guts and bones on the right side of his body to splay outward from the casing that no longer was holding all those important body meats inside. He gurgled and fell over dead within seconds.
</p>
<p>
	"ORC JESUS" Clarence yelled. Pirates had stopped and were now vomitting and crying.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh oh man I'm sorry" Ugla said. "We usually save violence like this for the 3rd act but like HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN STANDING THERE"
</p>
<p>
	"Wow that is just....that's fucked up" Clarence said without a hint of irony since again, he is a talking clam pirate who wants to fuck  his mom.
</p>
<p>
	The remaining pirates, now insenced at the thought they were going to have to clean up this gross dead body, screamed a piratey scream and charged at both Ugla and Sid. Ugla waved her staff around and shot electrical bolts through the bodies of 3 pirates like that scene in Last Crusade when Indy shoots those Nazis on the tank. PEW right through them. Their families will never know what happened to them because they were emotionally distant and never really kept in tough with their loved ones.
</p>
<p>
	Sid used to his duel daggers to slit the throats of several oncoming pirates. One pirate tried to use a candleabra as a weapon only to have Sid parry and thrust expertly around it. As he drew closer to the pirate Sid slipped Lil Pointy between the ribs of his assailent. As the pirate gurgled through the blood swelling in his trachea Sid pulled him closer and let out a gentle "Shhhhh shush now". The pirates last thoughts were "wow this dude is pretty fuckin cool".
</p>
<p>
	"LIttle help here Ugz!" Sid shouted down onto the lower deck. Without hesitation Ugla sent a fireball up hitting the pirate setting his already dead body ablaze. Sid then lit a spliff off of the fire and puffed a puff that would hot box even your sweet mama's gaping hot box.
</p>
<p>
	"Close enough" Sid said as he was hoping Ugla would hit the candles on the candle stick but this would do.
</p>
<p>
	After only a few more gruesom minutes the battle was over. The 2 lovers stood covered in pirate blood panting.
</p>
<p>
	"I need a cigarette after this poorly written violent metaphor for sex" Ugla said gasping for air.
</p>
<p>
	"FUCK THIS SHIT" CLarence said as he tried to leap overboard but his clam body was too small to get over the side of the ship.
</p>
<p>
	"Clarence how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man" Sid said as he grabbed Clarence and put him in one of those lobster cages.
</p>
<p>
	"C'mon guys" Clarence began to plead. "We didn't hurt anyone. This thing was being sailed by ghosts! Did you know the Graal Shipping Corp. hires ghosts and then pays them in GHOST DOLLARS? What the hell is even a ghost dollar? This was a victimless crime"
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah yeah" Ugla said dismissively. "The bounty on your head says otherwise."
</p>
<p>
	"No matter" Clarence said calmy. "I am a master of escape!" he said as he began to gnaw at the ropes of his cage with his clammy mouth.
</p>
<p>
	"I can see your tube foot" Ugla said disgusted.
</p>
<p>
	"Like what you see?" Clarence said somehow implying  a wink even though he didn't even have eyes? How is this a character in this story right now? What the fuck?
</p>
<p>
	As the ghost crew reappeared and sailed the ship back to Graal Harbor the sun began to set. Ugla stood looking out over the water admiring its calm and the glinting of the suns off of the blue green ocean.
</p>
<p>
	Sid slowly sidled up beside her leaning against the railing of the ship in the exact same manner she was.
</p>
<p>
	"I got you something" he said without looking at her as he  held out his hand.
</p>
<p>
	"I'm not a mother Sid" She said crooking an eyebrow at him.
</p>
<p>
	"No. But you're one...." Sid unfurled a golden rap necklace that said "BAD BITCH" encrusted in diamonds and rubies. This thing was like the size of a  clock and I dont mean a digital clock I mean like a Flava Flave sized clock. Is he dead? I sure hope not. Even though he banged Bridgitte Nielsen I really liked him. Is Bridgitte Nielson dead? Red Sonya was ok. 
</p>
<p>
	"Aw you shouldn't have" Ugla said with a laugh. She hugged Sid and they watched the water as Dolph Fins began to surface. Not Dolphins. Dolf Fins like Dolf Lundgren. They're like regular dolphins but their fins are jacked and muscley as fuck boy. Masters of the Universe as ok.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla let out a sigh.
</p>
<p>
	"Well that was the easy part of the day" she said snuggling up to Sid. "Now we have to go my parents."
</p>
<p>
	CUT TO:
</p>
<p>
	As Ugla rang the door chime at her parents upper middle class Graal home she took notice of just how many people were out mowing their lawns. The next thing she noticed was the teltale sound of her father's custome door chime which played a different AC/DC song every time it rang. Soon after Fred opened the door chewing on a entire steak.
</p>
<p>
	"Come in losers" he said with a smile. He hugged his sister and Sid and they did that Predator hand shake thing that honestly will never get old and should be in everything.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla quickly turned to Sid and began to whisper. "Ok I know this is your first time meeting my parents so I have to warn you. This is gonna suck. It's gonna suck hard. My dad is...well...he's insane."
</p>
<p>
	"I'm sure it'll be fine Ugz" Sid said. Deep down he wasn't nervous but kind of excited to meet Ugla's parents. Was that what love was? He'd never been excited to meet anyones parents. Not even the top quality Graal hookers he'd paid to be his girlfriends for a night. 
</p>
<p>
	"Dad this is Sid, He's uh...He's an business man of sorts."
</p>
<p>
	"Nice to meet you sir" Sid said holding out a hand. 
</p>
<p>
	"SID HUH" Ugla's dad said. He was a brute of a man. Tall and thick. He had an eye patch over one eye and a white beard. He looked like he ate tuna cans for dinner and shook Sids hand like he was trying to get the last of the toothepaste out of the tube.
</p>
<p>
	"HAHAHA" He laughed. "That's a firm grip ya got there son. Name's Ham "The Hog" Skullpeeler. Come Winnie, your mother is waiting to see you"
</p>
<p>
	"Winnie?" Sid questioned.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah that's my name. Winnie Wizenstein." She said curtly. "You didn't think my real name was Ugla did you? Thats just a nickname they gave me at Wizard Yale."
</p>
<p>
	"Winnie Wizenstein" Sid said with a laugh. "That's funny"
</p>
<p>
	"Why is that funny?" Ugla said seriously. Then she jabbed Sid in the ribs and smiled. "Come meet my mom"
</p>
<p>
	The two walked into a living area near a recliner that was reclined but noticably empty.
</p>
<p>
	"Mom." Ugla spoke to the empty chair. "This is my boy...boyfriend Sid"
</p>
<p>
	The chair sat in silence.
</p>
<p>
	"What the hell is going on" Sid thought inside his own head.
</p>
<p>
	Fred walked in and began speaking to the chair. "Do you want to be in the kitchen for dinner or in here mom?" He asked as he was now gnawing on an entire chicken. It was cooked. This time.
</p>
<p>
	"Ok whatever you want mom" Fred said leaving the room.
</p>
<p>
	"Uh..." Sid stammered. "ITS NICE TO MEET YOU MA'AM" Sid said in an uncomfortably loud tone.
</p>
<p>
	"Did...did she eat a batple?" Sid whispered to Ugla.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh no nothing like that" Ugla reassured him. "Dad gave her a cursed ring several Smother's Days ago and now she lives in a liminal void that is both a bridge out of this reality and a prison."
</p>
<p>
	"Oh...is that all" Sid said looking down at the chair.
</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile inside the liminal space Ugla's mother was trapped in she could only hear the screaming of ancient and long dead horrors as everythihng around her was an opaque white. The sounds of the dead haunted her every waking moment and she prayed for death. If only she could stop the sounds. She looked up to see the visage of Sid who was covered in spiders and darklings. As he spoke the sound was so loud it would have driven her insane if she wasn't already there. Hey but that's marriage for ya.
</p>
<p>
	"Sid my boy" Ham said. "Do you want to go look at my lawn mower?"
</p>
<p>
	"Sure...sure." Sid said eyes wide open now. What the hell was going on here.
</p>
<p>
	Soon all 5 of them were sitting at the table getting ready to eat the feast of Smother's Day. Ugla's mom was sitting, presumably, in an empty chair.
</p>
<p>
	"...AND THAT IS WHY STEIN 11 WAS AN INSIDE GROG" Ham finished his complete and totally normal though that wasn't at all conspiratorial or innappropriate for any conversation let alone dinner.
</p>
<p>
	"Sid you have to see my Stein 11 commemorative knife collection. They only appreciate in value. Got them off of QballVC for 5 ghost dollars. Any guess how much they're worth now?"
</p>
<p>
	"Uh anywhere between zero and five ghost dollars?" Sid guessed.
</p>
<p>
	"HAHA YEAH RIGHT." Ham said cockily. "More like MILLIONS"
</p>
<p>
	"Ya don't say" Sid said giving Ugla a look as if to say 'What the hell is going on here'. She gave him a look back like 'I fuckin told you these people were insane bro'.
</p>
<p>
	"So Winnie" Ham went on. "When are you gonna give up this ridiculous dream of being a wizard?"
</p>
<p>
	Sid dropped his fork mid chew like that gif from that show I never watched. Breakin Bad? I think the guys name is Uncle Jesse? Malcom in the Middle was ok.
</p>
<p>
	Fred slowly and painfully pushed himself back out of his chair as it made a really uncomfortable and lengthy SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRCHHHH sound. 
</p>
<p>
	"Welp....time I be getting some more steaks on the grill" he said not so tactfully excusing himself.
</p>
<p>
	"I am a wizard, father" Ugla said swooshing her beard.
</p>
<p>
	"No no I mean when are you going to be a real warrior? Like your brother? Not this namby pamby magic shit. I mean when are you going to go out and really peel some skulls?"
</p>
<p>
	Ugla set down her fork and dabbed her mouth with her napkin daintily.
</p>
<p>
	"When are you going to accept me for who I am?" Ugla shot back.
</p>
<p>
	Sid took another bite of eye ball pudding as his eyes shifted back and forth between the two combatants.
</p>
<p>
	"NO DAUGHTER OF MINE IS GONNA BE A BEARD WEARING HIPPIE MAGICK USER" Ham suddenly shouted.
</p>
<p>
	"I earned this beard! ITS WHO I AM NOW" Ugla shouted back. "I was the only female to graduate my class at Wizard Yale class of 6969 and I'll be damned if some old ass man who's days are WELL behind him will put me down for it"
</p>
<p>
	"You're a Skullpeeler" Ham said slamming his fist on the table. "You can take your mother's, god rest her soul, maiden name but you'll always be a Skullpeeler"
</p>
<p>
	"She's not even dead, dad! She's right here...." Ugla said pointing to the empty chair. "I think...."
</p>
<p>
	"Wizard Yale" Ham went on angrily chewing on some bread. "Dont even get me started on that lib east coast elite queer eye for the straight guy watchin watch your wife have sex with another man Will and Grace Gilmore Girls fast talkin, post modernist embracing participation trophy giving out, immigrants breathing up all of our magic hallucinegenic vapors, old toby smokin, college. And the debt! How much did it cost to go there again?"
</p>
<p>
	"Dad" Ugla said slamming her fist down equally as hard. "I took 400 level alchemy. I can literally turn this entire table into gold. I don't even have college debts. I LITERALLY can make gold out of shit"
</p>
<p>
	"Crypto currency" Ham said out of nowhwere. "Thats the future. Ghost dollars. You find them in Crypts." He continued to angrily chew on his bread.
</p>
<p>
	"You know what this has been really great and all but we have to leave. We have actual important things to be doing tomorrow" Ugla said covering her food with her napkin.
</p>
<p>
	"Mom it was great to see...uh...great to be here for you" Ugla said hugging nothing but air around the chair.
</p>
<p>
	"Dad. Go fuck yourself." She said with all the spite and venom of a viper. 
</p>
<p>
	"LEAVE" he shouted. Sid stood up and patted Ugla on the shoulder.
</p>
<p>
	"Thank you for having us over sir but I just have to say one thing" Sid said calmy. "AC/DC sucks in every dimension most especially this one"
</p>
<p>
	Ugla and Sid stood staring out at the docks over the harbor they had fought so hard to keep safe earlier that day, but Ugla's mind was on another battle. One she had fought a thousand times since she became a wizard. One that seemed to have no winner and no end in sight.
</p>
<p>
	"Hey" Sid said nudging her. "So that was...."
</p>
<p>
	"Yeahhhh..." she said in response. They stood quietly for what seemed like minutes.
</p>
<p>
	"He's not wrong ya know" She finally said.
</p>
<p>
	Sid shot her a look as if to say 'da fuq you sayin woman'?
</p>
<p>
	"I'm pretty sure your father is wrong about everything" Sid said with a forced laugh. Trying to make her feel better. Or maybe trying to make himself feel better.
</p>
<p>
	"No. If I am going to be a wizard I need to do more. There are so few of us left." She trailed off.
</p>
<p>
	"We have a good thing going here Ugz" Sid said trying not to sound desperate. Was he desperate? Desperate for her to stay with him. Desperate for them to kick everyones asses until there were no asses left to kick? He felt a tug at his hearts. Like one of them had moved an inch farther away from the other.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah I know we do. But...." She turned to face him. "There's something happening here. And I don't just mean in Graal. The whole world seems....off. Like that first day of real winter when there's no sound ya know? Everything is dulled....not sharp. I can't really explain it...."
</p>
<p>
	Sid knodded and tried to understand. Truthfully he couldn't. All he could think about was her.
</p>
<p>
	"Well..." he finally said. "I can come with you"
</p>
<p>
	She turned to face him completely now. 
</p>
<p>
	"No" she said. Just no. The word hit him like a mallet to the temple.
</p>
<p>
	"AHOY SCALLYWAGS, IT IS I CLARENCE!" A tiny clam pirate suddenly shouted from the docks.
</p>
<p>
	"NOT NOW CLARENCE WE'RE KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF A THING" Ugla shouted.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh my bad....I'll....I'll come back later." he relented. "Hey I'm going down to the cafe you guys want like a scone or like a chai or something? Large Chai? Venti? My treat!?"
</p>
<p>
	"CLARENCE FOR THE LOVE OF FUCK" Ugla screamed.
</p>
<p>
	"It wouldn't be safe for you Sid" She finally said after Clarence left. "Besides I have to go places that you can't. I have to walk this path alone"
</p>
<p>
	Sid felt his heart move another inch away from his other heart. 
</p>
<p>
	Ugla reached into her robes and pulled out the Bad Bitch rappers chain. She balled it up and handed it over to Sid.
</p>
<p>
	"You're the world's greatest theif" She said with a forced smile. "I'm sure you'll be able to steal my heart again in the future....WHEN we see each other again."
</p>
<p>
	Sid reluctantly held the chain. He rubbed his fingers over the jewels. He imagined them touching her skin. He was almost jealous they had touched her skin last but he ran his fingers over them in a vein attempt to feel her through the object itself.
</p>
<p>
	He cleared his throat.
</p>
<p>
	"You're the world's greatest wizard" He finally said choking back a tear. "That is who you are." 
</p>
<p>
	A tear rolled down her cheek as she smiled.
</p>
<p>
	"I'll be here for you when you get back" He said as a tear made its way down his cheek.
</p>
<p>
	And with that she was gone. Sid didn't even notice the portal zoop in and out of reality. What had just happened? They were a team not 4 hours earlier and now they...what? Were they breaking up? Was this like a business trip kind of thing or like a going away to college kind of thing where every sort of agrees that they're going to just do whatever and fuck whoever because zip codes mean its not cheating? What the actual fuck just happened? And what the hell is Stein 11?
</p>
<p>
	"Ahoy there boyo I got you a large Chai just in case" Clarence said waggling a hot drink in front of himself. Sid looked down.
</p>
<p>
	"Clarence my man. I'm going to need something a bit stiffer than chai tonight"
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
