Ep 30

Anachronism and Princesses

Running Out of Tome

 The cob webs wrapped around pillars and sprawled across from ceiling to floor just like the cob webs that infest your sweet mama's slam hole. Boris ducked and spat out the dusty arachnid butt highways as best as he could but still got a mouthful of spider spooge just like I did when I went down on your sweet mama's weiner garage last night. In contrast, Slit and the other goblins were making a game of slurping up all the spider webs they could. They cheered whenever of of them felt the pop of an exploding spider in their stank goblin mounts.

"OI got me another" Spank said with a smile as spider guts ran down his mouth like dribble.

Boris shuttered. Even for his vampire tastes this was too much. He'd had his fair share of disgusting meals. Like that time he crunched down on your sweet mama's lap buffet, but spiders? Nah that dog won't hunt.

"SAVE SOME SPIDEYS FOR US SLASH" Slit yelled as he jabbed SLASH in the stomach causing a Richter Scale level belch to erupt out of Spanks mouth.

"SLAP! SPARKY! ENOUGH!" AXewound yelled back.

"Mum...our names are..."

"MUM OUR NAMES ARE DDDDD I DONT CARE" Axewound snapped off Spank's correction before it could even mature into a full thought.

Up ahead Boris could see with his Vamp Vision that they were headed into another spookier wing of the ancient temple library. Above him golden glowing eyes of a thousand rats stared down at him until he saw one rat give him the neck slice motion then lift up his rat shirt to reveal the handle of a GUN!? WHAT THE FUCK?! 

"Where are you taking me?" Boris asked. And for his question got a swift slap on the ass.

"Quiet you!" Skate said raising a hand again threateningly but clearly only being able to reach the vampires leg humps.

"We're headed to the voice" Axewound replied anyway.

"Doooon't let her find meeeeee" The spooky lady voice rang through Boris' ears. Unfortunately Axewound's magiks also allowed her to hear the voice. Maybe she drank vampire blood before hand or like sucked off a whole brood of vamplings in some kind of fucked up but also hot as hell orgy ritual? Boris thought he better investigate that possiblity for science.

Suddenly the air became mustier than a Furry's taint at a vampling orgy. The goblins yanked on Boris' cuffs and stopped him from moving forward as Axewound held out her hands in a T pose and chanted some crazy magic words that sounded like Latin. 

"Enormumunus wangus flaccidus weenus" she shouted as all the candled in the ancient room lit up with a green glow. An unatrual light so erie that Boris would have prefered direct sunlight instead. Even though he was a day walker he found the sun "insistent" and "obnoxious".

In front of them lay a row of vaults. Each had a number on them ranging from 1 to 69.

"She's in one of these" Axewound said more directing the statement to Boris and not her lackies who were clearly fucking morons and probably only there for the orgy that Boris was hoping was still gonna happen.

"Spunk. Skank. Slut! Take the vampire over there" Axewound motioned to the far end of the row near vault 69.

"Nice" Slit said

"Now don't try and lie little vampire" Axewound said as she licked her finger and pressed it against Boris' forehead. Actually its more like a ninehead. He had male pattern baldness.

The spit on her finger burned an imprint into his third eye  and singed his mind.

"I will know if you are lying. And if you do....well...."Axewound flashed a scene of pure hell and gore into Boris mind. The pure amount of blood and viscera shocked him to his core. Demons raced through his mind and agony shot up his spine. And just as soon as it began it switched off.

"Well....woudn't want to get stuck there would we?" Axewound said blowing a kiss to Boris as the goblins trotted him over to the farthest vault.

"KEEPER OF KNOWLEDGE" Axewound bellowed as green fire lit her up in a verdent pyre of power and pure sex. She was lookin good.

"SPEAK!" She finished.

Boris looked around waiting for an answer to the Sexcromancers demand.

"NOOOOOOOOO" A ghostly voice said from farther down the row of vaults. Boris instictively reacted with Axewound. They both moved toward the center of the vaults.

"SPEEEAK TO ME KNOWLEDGE TOME YOU ABSOLUTE UNIT OF A NOVEL" Axewound again compelled.

"SUCK MYYYY DIIIIIIICK" The voice replied again giving away its location a little more.

"STOP answering her" Boris yelled to one of the vaults.

"Don't tellll meeee whaaaat to dooooo" the voice again replied getting Axewound closer to its location.

"FUCKIN IDIOT BOOK" Boris yelled.

"Yo mamaaaaamaaa" the voice again replied.

Axewound drew near vault 34 then stopped. It couldn't be that easy. Half way? But instead of blowing dust off of the vault number she simply knelt down and waved her hand across a stone slab underneath revealing the words "Vault 8 = D" along with an empty rectangular shaped hole.

"I ain't stickin my totally real goblin weiener into that booby trapped ass glory hole from spooky hell" Spank said matter of factly.

Axewound shot him a look that would petrify and erect any donger alive or dead. His eyes glowed green and his body went limp like my totally real goblin weiner did last night in yo mama's sweet cobweb infested sperm warehouse.

"I will do as you command" Spank said as he robotically moved toward the vault and the rectangular slot. As he did he mechanically began to remove his pantaloons and porky pig it straight to the rectangular hole inserting his gobbo donger.

"No....IDIOT YOUR HAND. JUST USE YOUR HAND!" Axewound yelled but it was too late. The vault door rumbled and let out a slight DING sound as its stone door began to open.

"OI what in the ell is this now" Spank said as he awoke from his trance. Just then he felt a tug on his peener.

"Uh ohhhh" were his last words as the vault vaporized his entire body except his donger which fell out of the hole and rolled toward Boris like that one guy's head at the end of Last Crusade.

The vault door clicked into place as a glowing radiant gold book shown brightly over the sickly green energy of Axewound's magik.

"SPUNK. The Kandle! NOW!" Axewound yelled to the 2 remaining goblins.

"uhhhhh is that...is that you or me?" Slit said to Slash.

"WHICHEVER HAS THE THING USE IT" Axewound screamed.

Slash fumbled the Kandle in his hands hot potato style and placed it under the glowing book. Soon the usual glow of magical text began to spread across the room in front of all of them.

"SLUT! Kill the vampire!" Axewound screamed.

Slit reached behind him and pulled out a flaming dagger. The green light dulled his already yellowed teeth as he held the dagger up to Boris and smiled. 

"HEY LOOK UP THERE!" Boris said as convincingly as he could.

"Huh" Slit looked behind him giving Boris enough time to head butt the goblin causing him to drop the dagger. Boris then used his foot to stabilize the dagger hacky sack style on its handle as he kicked it up into the air, spun around and jumped backwards grabbing the dagger with his cuffed hands. He then turned the knife downward and used all of his body weight to plunge the dagger into Slit's brain case. The goblin was still turned around never knowing what hit him.

"SKUNK LETS GO" Axewound said as she was already entering the portal into the book's textual realm.

Boris quickly started to saw at his bindings with the flame dagger, burning his fingers and hands in the process but finally able to gain freedom.

Just as the portal to the book realm was closing he jumped in thinking to himself "Why am I doing this?" as he did. He was no hero. But also he hated this bitch. 

The universe swirled around him and everything went black.

"GAAAAASP" Boris gasped as he awoke in a field. The wheat around him smelling sweetly as the sun kissed his pale white balding head.

thump tha thumpthump thump tha thumpthump. Drums in the distance rang through Boris' ears. He followed the sound and saw smoke on the horizon. Boris soon found himself in a village of dancing men and women who's boobs and dongers were out.

"Oh so its like one of THESE BOOKS" he said to himself. As soon as he did the drums stopped. Every eye in the village turned on him.

"Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit' he said outloud. But just as quickly as the drums stopped they started again as a conga line of dancers marched over to Boris and grabbed him by the hands swinging them up and down in celebration.

A single man decorated in a animal skins and a head dress made out of the skull of a dragon sat silently at a throne. The party raged on as Boris drank his fill of fermented fruit juice called "Jungle Juice" and played ancient and sacred competitive games such as "Beer Pong" and "Asshole". Finally, as the party began to die down, the Chief beckoned the now very drunk vampire over to his throne.

"Welcome, Darkling" he said deeply through his dragon mask.

"Yo...whatsup duuuude this party RULES" Boris said trying to fist bump the chief.

"Yes. It is" the Chief said reciprocating the bump. "We are an ancient sect of quest givers. Those who need to find their way may come to us to find a meaning in their life. We are A Tribe Called Quest." the Chief said.

"Is...is dis real or inside of the book?" Boris questioned taking a seat next to the Chief.

"What is the difference?" The Chief replied. Boris could tell he was smiling undernearth his mask. "I am a wizard. You need guidence so I have arrived here for you...to guide you....I am the Wizard Shaman Quest Love."

"But...I arrived here you didn't arrive to me?" Boris said confused.

"Hmmm an interesting way to look at it" Questlove replied contemplitively. "She is coming" he continued. "She is coming. The one who will destroy. The end of us"

"What....oh the bitch dressed like a sexy warlock for Halloween?" Boris questioned.

"She is coming...." Questlove raised his hands and summoned a portal. He then knelt down beside Boris and hugged him. "Go now. Save the future" he said as he pushed Boris into the portal.

"What HNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" Boris shouted as he tried to claw his way back to the village. "What should I DO!?" he screamed.

Questlove just nodded as the portal zooped out of existence.

As one portal closed another appeared instantly next to it. Outstepped a hot bitch wearing a sexy warlock costume. Again the drums stopped but this time there was no reverlry and raggae ton beat to welcome this new guest.

"We've been expecting you...Demoness" Questlove said matter of factly.

"Awww no beer pong welcome?" Axewound said sarcastically as her remaining golbin whos name I dont even remember at this point chuckled like a hyena.

"It would be pointless as you would not succeed at getting the little ball into my solo cups just like you will not succeed in destroying every wizard, you basic ass sorority cum dumpster" Questlove said with the regalist of tones.

"We'll see..."Axewound simlpy said as she raised her hands. Already glowing with green energy she raised up Questlove from his throne. Everyone in the village screamed as some tried to charge at the sorceress but as soon as they reached her a shield appeared which vaporized all who passed through it.

The village burned into the night and soon the screams could no longer be heard. All that remained on the throne of the WIzard SHaman was a skeleton. It smoked and smoldered until the sun and time bleached it of all color and memory.

Boris zooped back into the library with a THUD.

"FUCK!" he said. 

"Pleaaase you muuuussstt remove me from this prison" the book begged.

"How...how was that so real?" Boris questioned. 

"It was real" the book answered. "I am the Princess of all Knowledge. They call me Princess Tomestool. I am....ancient and powerful now please you must find a spot for me so we can take advantage of when that skank comes back through my portal."

"Ok....ok" Boris thought rubbing his head. "Do I need the Kandle or can you just like do this without it?"

"I'M A MAGICAL BOOK LET THE PATRERON NERDS SORT OUT THE DETAILS" the book snapped.

Boris grabbed the book and ran as fast as he could up through the libraries levels. He didn't know where he was going but he ran as the book's radiant glow showed him the way.

Axewound made her way through time as she slaughtered wizard after wizard. She sucked the lifeforce out of an Orc wizard who was reading to children in libary as part of his community service for bonecar drunk driving. She found her way to an ancient mountain top where a wizard who was like a goat man was just up there eating some dirty old grass and living his best life. She ate his haunches over a fire as Slit (sure lets go with Slit) sang all 56 minutes of Daranosian Pie on a lute.

She zooped into a shabby old man's tower only to find Reeses the Wize looking at All See Porn on his all see ball.

"Oh fuck this" he said as he portaled out with his pantaloons down around his ankles.

Her reign of terror didn't end until she found every single last wizard alive. Nobody noticed this serial style killing of wizards since many of hte murders would be recorded in history as taking place of hundreds if not thousands of years. There'd be no All See-Flix documentary about these unsolved mysteries.

"SLOOOOOOOORP" Axewound sucked the last of the life essence out of an ancient elven wizard who was living in an elven golden age of like lettuce and flowers or whatever the fuck those guys are super into.

"I am become death....destroyer of DORKS" she said as she clenched her fist slamming it down onto the ground. The earth rumbled and the sky shook as every wizards power now surged through her veins even those really prominient ones in her titties because they were so big.

Boris reached teh top of the libaries ramps and again looked down at the nothingness he had just ascended from.

"Wait" he said. "Can I...like I dont know...like hold you out over this ledge and then when those fuckers come back like...they fall to their deaths?"

"Surrrrreee that sounds like a plaaaan to meee" Princess Tomestool said indifferently.

"Ok cool.....I need like a stick or something...or like a fishing rod...." Boris looked frantically around through the piles of books.

"You're hoping to find a...fissshing rod in a libary?" The princess asked sarcastically.

"I DON'T KNOW!" Boris snapped. "I just time traveled or astral traveled into your book body and zooped out into a crazy party and made a new friend and now I'm back here trying to kill a Sexcromancer!"

"You're welcome for thaaaat by the way WINK" Tomestool said.

"Did you just say wink?" Boris asked.

"Welll I caaaan't veryyy well actually wiiiiink you fuuuckin ding dooonger" Tomestool snapped back.

Just then Tomestool began to rumbled.

"Ohhhhh god here she comes" She said as she looked like she was going to wretch and shit herself all at once. As much as a book can look like it's shitting itself. I'd imagine the cover turned into any Ernest Cline book cover or any script JJ Abrams has ever touched or laid eyes on.

Boris grabbed Tomestool and quickly held her out over the ledge into the never ending blackness below. A portal zooped out from the book and out walked Axewound and Slit. Upon hitting this reality Slit instantly fell into the abyss below screaming the entire way down. "FUUUUUCK SHIT THIS FUCKKIN SUUUUUCKS FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK" his voice became a distant echo until nothing was heard from Slit ever again.

Axewound on the other hand just stood in mid air.

"Tsk tsk tsk little vampire" She said wagging a finger. "You know as well as I do that if you don't look down you can't fall." She floated over to Boris who was still holding out Tomestool. She then laid down in mid hair with her hands under her chin like she was talking about boys at a sleepover and plinked Boris on the nose.

"I like you Vampire....you're fun" She said as she kissed him on the mouth and then soared back upright.

"Toodles" She said as she encased herself in black inky shadow. Turned into a screaming demon valkyrie and shot through the stone ceiling of the library.

"Wee neeeed to fiiiiind theeee lassst wizard" Tomestool said

"This fuckin suuuuuuuuucks diiiiiiiick" Boris said as he tucked the book under his arm and made his way out of the library.

THE END.
