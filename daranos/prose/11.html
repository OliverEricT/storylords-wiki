	Wizardfest
</p>
<p>
		A lone wolf howled at the twin moons of daranos like a cartoon wolf howlling at the twin ass cheeks of another sexy cartoon wolf in a cartoon so that you KNOW that that wolf is fuckable. The night was quiet. The dawn was approaching and the biggest day of the year in Daranos was about to begin. This shit was gonna make Druid Academy's 47th prom look like Druid Academy's 84th prom....yeah that prom...the one where the theme was Satans and instead of pigs blood being dumped on everyone it was red sex lube. There were no survivors.
</p>
<p>
	Every year Daranos's greatest wizards gather for a day of Wizardry and wonder and competition. It's sort of like Daranos Olympics but the years they did wrestling instead of body grease they used sex lube and well....you get the idea. This celebration of magic and wonder is of course WIZARDFEST! (que Rock U Like a Hurricane on repeat)
</p>
<p>
	Daranos's wizards are an illusive and mysterious lot. Some say that they're a myth. Others say that those people who say that are fucking idiots. Really the only wizard of note, who has been missing for over 8 years, could be counted as still alive. Other's probably sex spelled themselves to death or got their dongers stuck in a portal while trying to find the sex dimension. That's the only way to find it, just stick ur donger in a portal and hope for the best.
</p>
<p>
	So it came as a shock to EVERYONE when Reeses the Wize himself revealed himself after this long time and that this years WizardFest was going to be one event and one event only. A no holds barred Bonercycle/Bonercar race to Sephora Tower(no relation). Racers from all over the tri-realm area were set to compete in what was being called  and I quote the Daranosian Raven an "Erectile exstravaganze that may only be dwarfed by the time that I took your mama out back to skinny dip in the pool while you were sleeping over at andrews house but the neighbors saw us and came over and the next thing we knew we had to shock the pool 3 times just to get the base smell of new england man chowder out of the pool". That was a direct quote.
</p>
<p>
	Racers from all over the realm were set to claim the prize. As the suns rose above the horizon one racer, Cruz Marbleback, adjusted her mohawk as it whipped through the breeze. She was riding her Gnarly Grave-idson boner cycle at well above the Daranosian speed limit which was "What do we care we're not your mommy go suck on her tit if you need to be told how fast to drive fuck".
</p>
<p>
	Cruz was of course a dwarf. Not unlike wizards dwarfs were too increasingly more and more rare around the big D but Cruz was not going to miss this. Her entire life had been leading up to this race. The best of the best were racing and she was, well in her mind anyway, the best. Rumor also had it that the prize atop Sephora Tower was an ancient relic of ancient dwarven make. She not only would win the race and restore glory to her house, the Marblebacks, but she would return and ancient dwarven relic to its rightful owners. These fuckin humies and dorcs and lap lickers and JIZZ WIZARDS were always stealin dwarven shit. Like..."get your own cool shit you fuckin posers" she thought to herself as she revved the Gnarly into high gear and tore ass through the forest.
</p>
<p>
	Soon Cruz pulled up to an ancient tower. Atop the tower trumpeters greeted her entrance with a trumpet version of "Bad to the Bone" as was tradition.
</p>
<p>
	"HEAR YE HEAR YE" a friendly voice bellowed out from atop the tower. "His great majesticness Reeses the Wize has decreed that this Wizardfest, shall be the final Wizardfest."
</p>
<p>
	The crowd gasped and hushed all at once. I bet you at home feel sad about this being hte last Wizardfest even though you only learned about it like 2 minutes ago. Yeah...that's how you do pathos Rich I didn't even have to kill anyone. See?
</p>
<p>
	"So in being this last of a great tradition, his Wizzedness has decreed that whoever may reach the top of Sephora Tower first shall claim a prize most worthy of only the richest slash comliest slash power horny competitors" the announcer finished.
</p>
<p>
	"The race will begin in 1 hour" the announcer proclaimed then turned back into the tower. 
</p>
<p>
	"Very good Gary" Reeses said as he sat in his wizard seat.
</p>
<p>
	"No problem Reese old boy. I'm happy to MC this thing plus I wouldn't miss it for the world my cousin is racing today."
</p>
<p>
	"It will be a day long remembered" Reeses said almost with a sinister tone. It was certainly cryptic but hey thats wizards for ya, they fuckin eat that drama shit up.
</p>
<p>
	The crowd soon began to rumble with anticipation. What was this prize? Why was this the last Wizardfest? Where had Reeses been for 8 years? Did something happen that made him not want to do the show...I mean not was to show his face around Daranos?
</p>
<p>
	Cruz set up  in a makeshift pit area and began to wash her bonercycle and check its magical engine core made of dwarven crystals. They thrummed in idle mode their power hungering to be unleashed. It was like they were being fed by Cruz's desire to win. Or maybe thats just what Cruz was telling herself.
</p>
<p>
	All around were racers and adventurers from all over the land. There was Crump Dungle, the famous troll grave robber. Cruz was pretty sure he'd die since like...whath did he learn how to race in the library with his nerd books? Yeah...that guy wasn't making it to the end of this story.
</p>
<p>
	Next she saw Blight Snowvoid a famous half lich from the northern reaches. His mommy and daddy spoiled his ass so much its no surprise he was now waxing up his Bonerarri. His flaming rag soaking up the virgin blood wax he was applying to his already ridiculously red eye sore of a bonecar.
</p>
<p>
	Next Cruz saw two racers she did not recognize. Both hooded in black with some soft of magical cloak. Each time Cruz tried to peer into the cload to see their face it was like the cloak itself made her brain blank out the image.
</p>
<p>
	One of these racers was dressed modestly in black racing robes while the other was dressed in said cloak but wore like a thong and leggings and that garter thing that ladies from the 40's  would wear. Over their chest was just pasties barely covering up huge dinner plate nipples. Cruz looked at her racing poll scroll and saw two names. Racer X and Racer SEX. "Okay" she thought.
</p>
<p>
	The only other racer that caught her eye was a racer named Rob the Zombie. He was lurching around his bone Dragula trying to get into it but he couldn't lift his leg over the small little dragula door. Poor guy.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly trumpets began to sound again this time to the tune of Highway to the Danger Bone by Kenny Floggins. Suddenly the tower began to rumble. The spectators and racers all mumbled in concern. Some even let out a scream as the tower itself began to crumble to the ground. But not really collapse. The tower itself was just....lowering to the ground like an elevator or a "lift" for our british weirdos.
</p>
<p>
	The crowds concern soon became awe as the tower top stopped level with the ground and out rolled a red carpet. Soon a frail old man came wobbling out supported only by his staff at the top of which sat an ancient gem. Some gasped and others toasted  each other. Wizardfest had begun.
</p>
<p>
	As the wizard crept slowly out on the red carpet his bones shook. Everyone could practically hear his ancient joints cracking, the cartilidge having long been worn down like too much jizzbutter over yo mama's toasty fiery clappers. Suddenly the wizard fell forward. The crowd gasped but just as quickly the wizard did a roll and righted himself holding his arms out to his sides as if to say "GOTCHA BITCHES". The crowd and the competitors cheered.
</p>
<p>
	"HELLO MY FRIENDS" Reeses shouted. "Today marks the six thousdand nine hundred and sixty ninth WIZARDFEST!" as he said this firecrackers flew like missiles out of the tower and exploded into cool shapes like one was a dick and the other was a boobs and there was like a kitty cat and one that said "911 was an inside job". That one must have been on sale.
</p>
<p>
	"I'd like to thank Josh for bringing me back for this episode" Reeses went on. The crowd looked dumbfounded
</p>
<p>
	"Reeses I told you could read the lines in the story as yourself. Now you're ad libbing"
</p>
<p>
	"Sorry sorry I'm just excited that I'm back and that I get to mooch off of...I mean contribute to your stories in this new all see ball cast you're doing with Jeff and Other Jeff"
</p>
<p>
	"Ok its cool Reeses just keep to the script please nobody likes this meta ass shit this isn't Rick and Morty for fuck sake"
</p>
<p>
	(reeses clears his throat)
</p>
<p>
	"As I was saying my friends. This Wizardfest will be the last...just as it will be the last day alive for most of our competitors"
</p>
<p>
	At this the crowd again grew disquieted.
</p>
<p>
	"But for the brave and the faitful the prize shall be worth it!" Reeses gestured with his staff and soon a magical image of an ancient golden pyramid could be seen.
</p>
<p>
	"OOOOO AHHHH" The crowd said in unicen.
</p>
<p>
	"The Shard of Tycon" Reeses said.
</p>
<p>
	Again the crowd grew silent. Some probably because they didn't know what the hell that was. But Cruz did.
</p>
<p>
	The Shard was said to be a key. A key through time. Holding the Shard would grant its owner a gateway to anypoint in their lifetime to go and repair or take advantage of a time where they could change their destiny's. Cruz's guess was that those racers who did known what the Shard was were there for any number of reasons. Looking at Crump she could only guess why he'd want such an artifact aside from being an archiologist. Maybe he lost someone? Maybe he lost himself along the way and wanted to fix it. One thing was for certain, not everyone here was after the Shard for reasons that would be considered honorable.
</p>
<p>
	"OK LETS GET THIS CANDLE LIT. START YOUR BONERS" Reeses yelled.
</p>
<p>
	"GOOD LUCK ROB" Gary shouted over the thunderous roar of engines and magic.
</p>
<p>
	"DIG THROUGH THE DITCHES GARY" Rob the Zombie gurgled at  his cousin.
</p>
<p>
	"What does that mean" asked Reeses as he leaned toward Gary.
</p>
<p>
	"Ah its just something he says all the time. Rob isn't quite all there ya know?" 
</p>
<p>
	"Oh on the account of him being a zombie I get it" Reeses said nodding.
</p>
<p>
	"Nah he was like that before the zombification but hey he found his calling in life and we're all proud of him for being successful in his zombie carreer" Gary said as he smiled at Rob and gave a thumbs up.
</p>
<p>
	"ON UR MARKS. GET SET. GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BONERS GOOOOOOOOO" Reeses shouted as a green flare shot out of his staff. And witih that the race had begun.
</p>
<p>
	Cruz edged her way around a frog man who was having trouble with his aqua turbines. He sputtered and slowed as she passed him giving him a sarcastic salute.
</p>
<p>
	"RIBBBBBBIIIIIIITT" he screamed in frustration as he slammed his frog feet agains the engine. 
</p>
<p>
	Up ahead of Cruz were the two Racers X or the two Racers SEX? The two mysterious racers. They were jockying for position and didn't look to be none too friendly with each other even though it seemed like they coordinated outfits before the race like they were going to Druid Prom. Racer X kicked their leg out to the side. As they did a long dagger shot out of the toe of their boot. They stabbed their boot at the Racer Sex's crystal energy core but Racer Sex was too quick and used a shielding spell to deflect the feeble physical attack. Cruz heard a distinct femal laugh from Racer Sex. I mean she was wearing like basically nothing so that was kind of obvioius but you never know and hey maybe they like to be called something else. We've learned a lot in 8 years here in Daranos.
</p>
<p>
	As the racers roared through the forest they passed a tree with a Mirkmunk family's little cozy tree home nestled inside. A sinlgle blind on the tiny window was pulled down and an eye squinted as the roar of the bone vehicles sped past. Suddenly the door burst open and a small Mirkmunk boy ran out and began cheering.
</p>
<p>
	"GO DADDY GO" he yelled and waved a little mirkmunk sized penant that said "GO DAD" on it.
</p>
<p>
	Below on a tiny yet speedy bonercycle a Mirkmunk looked up and shouted "GO DO YOUR HOMEWORK JEREMY I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANOTHER D ON YOUR REPORT CARD" As he finished he though to himself  "If I win this I'm gonna go back in time and make sure that kid is never born" he thought....."never born without EVERY ADVANTAGE" he finished. A single tear slid down his furry face as he yelled back to Jeremy "I LOVE YOU SON"
</p>
<p>
	Soon the front runners reached a large canyon. Along the canyon various portals were aligned. Cruz clenched her jaw as she realized that each portal lead to the other side...she hoped. She watched curiously as Blight Snowvoid reached a portal and sped right into it without a second thought. As Cruz watched she didn't see Blight exit any of the portals on the other side of the canyon.
</p>
<p>
	Somewhere in the desert of Daranos a portal opened up and out shot a Bonerarri going like fast as fuck. As it hit the sand the Bone car skid and slid to a halt practically burying itself in the sand. 
</p>
<p>
	"FUCKIN SHIT MAN I'M GONNA TELL  MY DADDY AbOUT THIS YOU FUCKIN WIZARD FUCK" Blight cried like a little bitch. Just then the ground began to rumble. Blight was shaken and even his Lich Bitching couldn't save him this time. Out of the ground grew an enormous stone golem. I mean this mother fucker was like 800 feet tall. 
</p>
<p>
	"Ooooo new toy" he grumble as he picked up the Bonerarri and placed it on a giant shelf in his giant stone room next to other bone cars he had "collected'
</p>
<p>
	"A fine addition to my collection" he said
</p>
<p>
	"CRAG DINNERS READY" Blight heard another voice yell.
</p>
<p>
	"COMING MOM" 
</p>
<p>
	Back at the race Cruz had to pick a portal. "Well any portal was better than that one that idiot went though" she thought. Closing her eyes she rode into a different portal and held her breath. After a micro second she was relieved to see she came out on the other side of the canyon along with the two Racers X's, that troll dude who's name I forget and about half hte other racers. Suddenly in front of her another portal opened up on the gorund and out shot a dog man. He flew straight up into the sky as if gravity had no power over he nor  his bone  car.
</p>
<p>
	"FUUUUUUUUUUUCK" he yelled as he flew  up into the sky and went into space. In space he would die a slow painful death as every cell in his body would explode due to lack of pressure and the nitrogen in his blood would boil so that every second of painful life he had left was like hell itself were inside of every atom his is body. Some say his husk is still floating around out there and that's where the phrase "Dog GONE IT" comes from.
</p>
<p>
	"Glad I didn't take kthat one" Cruz said swerving and laughing.
</p>
<p>
	The racers were packing together now. They entered a plains area where the ground and roads were easier to see and straight aways were plenty allowing each racer to gather speed. As the lead group flew past a hermit on the side of the road the sheer speed of their bonercars lit the shabby rags he was waering as clothes aflame as his skin flew off his very bones leaving only a skeleman standing where once was a hermit who was probably just out looking to sun his nads or eat some berries or some shit.
</p>
<p>
	As the bonercars drove off all the hermit could say was "FUCKIN RADICAL" and then collapsed into a heap.
</p>
<p>
	The pack now headed into a dark area. Clouds as dark as the heart of a thousand liches gathered. Up head Cruz saw an enormous wall. They were close to Sephora tower. 
</p>
<p>
	"How the hell are we supposed to get over that" she said it herself. As she looked left and right other racers didn't seem to be slowing down so she too gunned it.
</p>
<p>
	"Think Cruz" she demanded of herself.
</p>
<p>
	She looked over and heard a loud "CLANK". Out from Racer X's bonercycle shot a grapplilng hook. It shot far out over the wall...impossibly far and stuck true at the top of the wall. The bonercycle began to reel in the chain and the bike began to fly instead of drive. Next to Racer X Racer SEX was using magic to hover her bike into the air. As she hit the walls surface the bike stuck to the stone like ferris metal to a magnet.
</p>
<p>
	Cruz had none of these tricks. Thinking quickly she  leaned over to the side of her bike and grabbed an ancient spear left on some ancient battlefield of some ancient and forgotten battle. She turned her head frantically looking for her victim. THERE! She thought. Crump Dungle was frantically looking around he too realizing he didn't have any means of scaling this obstacle. Cruz pullled up beside him
</p>
<p>
	"Only one shot at this" she said to her self holding the spear in her left hand and readying it. As she pulled alongside Crump she tossed the spear into his front wheel like that part in Indiana Jones 3. The sudden stoppage of locomotion from the front wheel caused Crump's bike to flip over several times as he skid and became a meat crayon on the rough grey ground in front of Cruz. Then she pulled the sickest wheely ever and used the wreckage of Crumps bike and broken body as a ramp to launch herself onto the wall.
</p>
<p>
	"Deploying spikes" she said as dozens of spikes shot out from her bone wheels gripping the bike to the wall like acid jizz in Flyman's pantaloons after a raunchy hive dream.
</p>
<p>
	It was a 3 man race to the top  now. They cleared the wall and as they reached the bottom of the tower they saw a spirally ramp built long ago goinog up the side of the tower to the tippy top. The 3 racers were now gunning it. Leads changed often as they ascended to their destiny.
</p>
<p>
	Cruz managed to draft past the two Racers X and reach the top first. She bailed off the bike as it slid and sparked on the hard stone of the  tower. In front of her was the Shard of Tycon. Glowing gold. Red electricity sparking all around it. Cruz looked back to see how close the others were but could only see Racer X trailing her. 
</p>
<p>
	Cruz ran full sprint and grabbed for the Shard but just as her fingers felt the tingly electric static of the red power she was launched backwards. She hit the ground and gasped for air not being able to suck in any. She paniced as she writhed in pain. Racer SEX stepped out of a portal and grabbed the Shard laughing like a fuckin BITCH about it. Racer X stood and looked over Cruz. They knelt down and checked to see if the dwarf was alright. 
</p>
<p>
	"You're alright" they said calmingly again in a female sounding voice.
</p>
<p>
	Racer Sex removed her magical cloaking cloak and held up the Shard like it was the Stanley Cup. As she looked down at her foes Racer X mumbled...
</p>
<p>
	"AXEWOUND".....
</p>
<p>
	"Awww its ok ladies" Axewound said. "Looks like the sexiest wins again" as she made a whipping sound against her own butt which was kind of hot but like what the fuck we weren't even talking about that lady you're fuckin full of yourself ya know?
</p>
<p>
	Racer X stood still and tall. The wind whipped around her making her claok flutter like in a fuckin cool ass anime.
</p>
<p>
	"You didn't win" she said. "The Shard belongs to the DWARVES!" She screamed as she launched herself toward Axewound. Axewound cackled and sent out another lightning bolt but Racer X held up a hand and created a rune shield. Cruz sat up catching her breath and searching for any seriouis injuries. Nope...just her pride.
</p>
<p>
	Axewound again laughed and opened a plot portal but this time it was underneath of Cruz. Cruz fell through instantly. Behind where she had been another portal opened up above the edge of othe tower dropping her down down down.
</p>
<p>
	Racer X looked back in mid stride to see Cruz exit the portal and fall. She stopped and turned toward Axewound who was doing the sarcastic crying eyes and frown move. She then laughed again, gave Racer X the double finger, and walked through the portal. As she did the tower began to rumble. Stones fell. Larger stones colided with smaller ones and the cascade effect of mass and gravity began to bring the whole tower down.
</p>
<p>
	"FUCK" Racer X screamed at the top of her lungs as she sprinted toward the edge of the tower and dove off. Her black cloak billowing in the wind like the feathers of a hawk as she straightened herself mid fall to gain momentum and reach terminal velocity. She saw Cruz and reached her hand out to grab her. She saw the horror on Cruz's face as they were just about to the slam into the ground and become a paste.
</p>
<p>
	Just then Cruz woke up. She was in a field. Was she dead? Did they hit the ground? In the distance red lightning and a giant dust cloud could be seen miles away. "THE TOWER" she thought.
</p>
<p>
	She slapped herself across her face with her meaty hand.
</p>
<p>
	"OUCH" she said. "Guess I'm not dead"
</p>
<p>
	Just then the hermit skeleton from earlier walked up to her.
</p>
<p>
	"Some race huh?" he said as he held out an potato for her to eat. "Eat this itll make you feel better"
</p>
<p>
	She grabbed it without thinking. She sat with it as the Skele-hermit rattled off onto the road and carried on with his day.
</p>
<p>
	Back at the tower Racer X sat facing the destruction around her. This was a portend of things to come. She knew this was the begining....or the end. She had failed to get the Shard. And why had Reeses even made it possible for Axewound to grab the shard in the first place. What was he THINKING? She though as she slammed her hand down onto a stone cracking the stone as she hit it. She sighed and looked up to the sky. Out of one tiny crease in the darkest of clouds she saw the sun peak through and light her up. She sat there feeling its warmth as she took off her cloaking cloak.
</p>
<p>
	As she did the crease in the cloud closed up and the wind picked up around her as her beard blew from one side to the other.
</p>
<p>
	THE END.
</p>
