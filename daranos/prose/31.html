<p>
	Hogs and Rifts
</p>
<p>
	 The fireflies lit their butts up creating a sea of butt light for Ugla, Squib, Buffcat and Demi wade through as the suns set over Daranos. They were no nearer to their destination, the gleaming Turd on the Hill, The Big Crab Apple, The City of Butthurtly Love, The Windy Shitty itself...Graal.
</p>
<p>
	As they walked Squib began to sing an old Goblin shanty:
</p>
<p>
	 And I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
</p>
<p>
	 I'll eat hair (I'll eat hair)
</p>
<p>
	 And I swear I like to eat hair from the drain (it's best there)
</p>
<p>
	 For better or worse I'll eat from your part
</p>
<p>
	 I prefer blondes because brunettes make me fart
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly a tiny door swung open from an oak tree above them.
</p>
<p>
	"HEY! HEY YOU!" A small mirkmonk wearing an ole timey night cap sipping an acorn mug filled with hot steaming nut juice. "MY SON IS TRYING TO SECRETLY GET TO SECOND BASE IN HIS ROOM WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND. I WILL NOT HAVE HIS FIRST GRASP OF TIT BE TO THE DULCET TONES OF EARLY TO MID 6990s MIDDLE SCHOOL DANCE GRAB ASS R&B! HE GRABS TEET AT AT LEAST A SOPHOMORE LEVEL!"
</p>
<p>
	Squib continued to sing as they walked into the glittery dark having no idea that a mirkmunk was even talking.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah you BETTER RUN" the Mirkmunk said as he slammed the door, drew the blinds, and then opened one blind up and squinted out taking a long slurp from his nut juice.
</p>
<p>
	"SO.....TIRED" Demi said as she struggled to pick up her feet. She drug them along the dirt of the path as she groaned and whined like all 11teen year olds do about a hard days work OH MY GOD HAVE I BECOME MY FATHER?!?!?! HELLO YES GUN STORE! ONE GUN WITH ONE BULLET PLEASE DOORDASH IT TO MY PAYPAL!
</p>
<p>
	"We have to keep going even through the night if we're going to make it to Graal within the next fortnite" Ugla said looking back at the weary teen. "Why don't you and Squib play a road game?"
</p>
<p>
	"What the H.E. double toothpicks is a game?" Demi questioned turning up her nose.
</p>
<p>
	"Uhhh its a thing you do for fun" Ugla said matter of factly.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh like when you have to run away from the automogaurds before they flay your face off for taking the last slice of cardboad for dinner bc it used to have pizza on it and maybe the flavor of petrified cheese and sauce can still be tasted on the ancient trash food?" Demi pereked up.
</p>
<p>
	"Ye....No...wait what? Damn kid we need to maybe get you some therapy." Ugla said actually worried because that is fucked up. "No. Ok lets play I Spy. You start with a letter of the alphabet and one of you starts by saying 'I spy something that starts with an A' and then you say...."
</p>
<p>
	"APPLE" Squib interjected jumping up and down holding out his hands for a treat. Ugla passed him a single peanut.
</p>
<p>
	"Good Squib" She said patting him on the head. "Ok now you go Demi"
</p>
<p>
	Demi sighed a teenagerly sigh and looked around in the woods, in the dark, and tried to find something to spy.
</p>
<p>
	"I spy something that starts with W" she sighed out.
</p>
<p>
	"MEW" Buffcat said
</p>
<p>
	"Yes good job BC. Wood. It was wood." Demi said patting him on the head as he purred.
</p>
<p>
	"MEW MEW MEW" Buffcat went next.
</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile the bushes around them began to rustle in the darkness as all the animals in the forest went silent.
</p>
<p>
	"Awww hell no I'm out" The Mirkmunk said from behind his blinds as he closed them up again and went to bed.
</p>
<p>
	The wind picked up through the leaves as an unease settled onto the forest floor like a weighted blanked settles farts into your bed at night.
</p>
<p>
	"OOooOOOoOOO" a spooky voice said from the bushes.
</p>
<p>
	"MEW" Buffcat replied clearly still thinking they were playing the game and shaking his head in the negative.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla held up a fist tactically and the whole group stopped in their tracks. Demi instictively ducked down and grabbed the hilt of her flame sword "Sinthia". She scanned her surroundings only hearing her own heart beat in her ears. Buffcat knelt down and wiggled his butt ready to pounce as his ears darted around his head scanning for the sounds origin.
</p>
<p>
	Just as Buffcat was readying his tail flail, a corpussled dececated rot infested figure lurched from their left out of the tree line.
</p>
<p>
	"A MOTHER FUCKIN ZOMBIE" Squib shouted as he jumped up into Ugla's arms.
</p>
<p>
	Buffcat was already in mid leap when he began to triple lindy spin around like a figure skater. His tail flail chain rattling in the night as it spun faster and faster. As he spun over the zombie the chain wrapped itself around its neck and clasped on tight. Buffcat then perfectly super hero landed looked right up past the camera as the zombie's head flew off behind him slightly out of focus. As the camera focused past buffcat blood and ichor shot from the neck hole of the now decapitated zombie. 
</p>
<p>
	"OH FUCK ME GOD DAMNIT" the zombie shouted as he head rolled back into the tree line. "Little....little help over here you crazy adventuring kids?" it said politely.
</p>
<p>
	Ugle used her staff to move away some shrubbery and there in a pool of its own black bile filled blood lay the head of a man who had recently become zombified.
</p>
<p>
	"Hi yes me down here" he said using his eyes to point at himself somehow. "I was looking for you ever since you left that other town where the paladins were doing something I forget it was like 3 episodes ago. Princess and disaster I think I dont remember"
</p>
<p>
	"Get on with it Zombie Scum" Demi said looking around for approval.
</p>
<p>
	"Well now my stars young lady that is no way to speak to your elders." the zombman scolded Demi.
</p>
<p>
	"Oh sorry Mr. Zombie Man I just thought you were like...gonna eat our brains or turn us into chairs or something crazy I'm not from around here I dont know." Demi trailed off.
</p>
<p>
	"No why would I want to eat....whatever...anyway. Ugla Wizard of the Realm. My town needs you" The zombie head went on. 
</p>
<p>
	"NO!" Ugla said emphatically. "NO NOOOO NO NO NO NONO JUST NO" 
</p>
<p>
	Buffcat and Squib both turned to her in disbelief.
</p>
<p>
	"NO....we can't stop and help every town village dale hamlet and harry we pass. We'll never make it to Graal at this rate and we NEED to get to the city."
</p>
<p>
	"But...your wizendness...." The head went on. "A great plague has ravaged my village. First it starts out as an incurable fever and then quickly come the pustules of blood and mucus. Then...as if stricken by some lustly demon one has the uncontrollable urge to FORNICATE until one's PEENER either explodes or falls off from all the friction. After bleeding to death from peener loss you arise within 12 hours a zombie. Please mum will you help us?" A single tear rolled down the zombie mans face.
</p>
<p>
	"C'mon Ugla" Squib said still holding Farm Boys dog tags close to his heart. "We should help when we can shouldn't we?"
</p>
<p>
	"MEW" Buffcat agreed.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla sighed. "Fine. But I swear to god this is the last fucking zombie plague or paladin cabal or fuckin emergency prom booze run for the kids at the druid school or whatever other dumb shit thing is going on in this stupid reality. We're not the A-Team for fuck sakes."
</p>
<p>
	"OH thank you missus!" The head said. "Now if one of you would kindly destroy my brain case so that I don't have to exist as just a head that would be WONDERFUL"
</p>
<p>
	"Mew mew mew" Buffcat said swinging his tail around and caving the zombie head guy's face in.
</p>
<p>
	"Ahhh nope...didn't work best to try it again there chap" the head said muffled by the face flaps being caved into his mouth. But it was too late the party had already began moving toward the town.
</p>
<p>
	"Hellooooo?" He shouted.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla complained the entire way. "I swear if this show wasn't 26 episodes long and we had a deal with Prime or something we'd be IN Graal by now...." he voice trailing off as they reached further and further into the woods.
</p>
<p>
	"Great." The head said. "Now I'll have to turn into a talking skull and we all know what those freeloaders are like. Always breathing up our air with their no lungs those no lung having white boned rattling in the night ass dancing in graveyard dancing calcium heads"
</p>
<p>
	Yup. That's right. Zombie Village Head Guy was a racist. Bet you thought he was nice becaused he used nice words and even scolded little Demi about her rudeness. Just goes to show you: never trust a talking zombified head in the woods. You never know when one will be a racist and make you look like a sucker.
</p>
<p>
	By morning the group had reached the village. They were exhausted. Demi was only walking with the help of Buffcat who was doing big kitty yawns like every 5 steps. Ugla planted her staff into the ground and looked around at the seemingly empty town. Usually this early as the sun was coming up towns had their farmers out selling goods and the morning shift prostitutes were powdering their b-holes.
</p>
<p>
	"OI who's in charge around here" Ugla shouted out in no direction in particular.
</p>
<p>
	"Yes yes sorry miss sorry I am here" a small gnome scurried out of his hut toward the adventurers. "I am town cryer and acting mayor Thimbles Alabaster" He said with a bow.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla stared down at him resisting the urge to roll her eyes.
</p>
<p>
	"Yes well" Thimbles went on. "As you can see we are in a BIIIIT of a pickle here" he said waving his hands around.
</p>
<p>
	"We heard your town has sex zombies and their dicks explode" Demi said half waking up for this part of the conversation.
</p>
<p>
	"HAHAH no no no.....no no....well....yes" Thimbles said rubbing his hands together nervously. "Can you like....fix it?" He said with a smile.
</p>
<p>
	"MEW" Buffcat said affirmitavely before Ugla could even answer.
</p>
<p>
	"EXCELLENT YES GOOD" THimbles said clapping his tiny hands.
</p>
<p>
	"We'll need to see the patients" Ugla said firmly.
</p>
<p>
	"Yes yes of course. This way" Thimbles motioned to a tavern. "This over here is what we call the Fuck House. It's where we keep all of the infected and let them...(cough) let out their urges before they move onto the next stage of the illness"
</p>
<p>
	Thimbles led Ugla and Buffcat to the tavern door. Demi and Squib followed behind.
</p>
<p>
	"You two" Ugla said turning around "NAH UH. You stay here. I'm not letting kids see this fucked up shit"
</p>
<p>
	"Awwww maaaaaan" Demi said disappointedly.
</p>
<p>
	"But I'm 57 years old...." Squib said lowering his head in shame.
</p>
<p>
	The inside of the tavern smelled like the inside of a sock hamper at an all boys private school. Ugla reflexifely raised her hand up to her nose to cover it. All around corpses were just going the fuck at it. It was not hot. The sloshing sound alone was enough to make Buffcat wretch and do that cat cough thing.
</p>
<p>
	"Can you help them?" THimbles asked hopefully.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla stood there stunned at what she was seeing. Nothing in the whole of Daranos could prepare even a wizard for this amount of meat slapping and moaning. The moans of agony mixed together with the moans of pleasure in a sort of hellish whalesong that not even yo freaky ass mama would use as white noise to get to sleep and that bitch likes to do ear shit.
</p>
<p>
	"OH GOD OH GOD MY HOG. MY TOTALLY REAL GIANT HOG IS GOING TO EXPLODE" one infected dude said as he stood up fully buck nude.
</p>
<p>
	Ugla and Buffcat exited the tavern with Thimble quickly as they quickly closed the wooden door which did little to muffle the popping sound of the man's giant blood engorged hog exploded against the wood and blood seeped from the crack below.
</p>
<p>
	"Where did these people get such a horrible disease?" Ugla asked aloud.
</p>
<p>
	"Well most of these folks are farmers. Folk have been saying at night a curse rolls through and infects them. Either that or they're all fucking the same necromancer and she or he has a scorching case of the Burny Wormies" Thimble said.
</p>
<p>
	"I'll need a lab" Ugla declared. "And all the medicinal herbs and magical flames and coffee. Like a million CC's of coffee." She grabbed her staff from the dirt and headed into another building without thinking.
</p>
<p>
	"That's the Pre Cum Taver over there miss!"
</p>
<p>
	"OH FOR THEE LOVE OF FUCK" Ugla shouted.
</p>
<p>
	Days passed as Ugla tried every concievable combination of formulae she knew to every illness and disease ever seen in the realm. She rubbed sweat from her brow as she used alchemical precision to mix and distill tonics and potions. She even tried a lotion that when jerked off with the infected would absorb the remedy through their dick skin. All failed.
</p>
<p>
	"FUCK THIS" she shouted.
</p>
<p>
	Buffcat awoke form his mid lunch 3 hour power nap with a jolt.
</p>
<p>
	"Without knowing what is causing this I can't get close to curing these fucking zombified perverts." Fruststrated she face planted onto the table and groaned.
</p>
<p>
	Just then outside the clopping of horse hooves grew louder and louder. 
</p>
<p>
	"DICK SHAPED FRUITS HERE GET UR DICK SHAPED FRUITS" a vendor called from his mobile food carriage. "CAN'T HAVE INSATIABLE ZOMBIFIED SEX WITHOUT REHYDRATED WITH VITAMINS FROM A DICK SHAPED FRUIT" he busked on.
</p>
<p>
	Without thinking Ugla shot up and opened the door to the outside as Demi followed.
</p>
<p>
	"You...DIck Salesman" Ugla shouted up at the man.
</p>
<p>
	"Ahhhh I prefer Penile Peddler" the man corrected.
</p>
<p>
	"yeah yeah where. Did you get these?"
</p>
<p>
	"I got them from the farming consoritium right down the road. I usually make it back to town every week but this week I'm late. Had to take the wife to the doctor you see. She had a bad fever and"
</p>
<p>
	"Shit" Demi said 
</p>
<p>
	"Where is your wife now?" Ugla shouted.
</p>
<p>
	"Ah she's staying at her mother's until she feels better."
</p>
<p>
	"No...." Ugla cut him off. "She's already dead...."
</p>
<p>
	The man stood stock still thinking about the bomb Ugla had just dropped on his entire life.
</p>
<p>
	"Welp. OH WELL" he finally said. "DICK SHAPED FRUITS GET UR DICK SHAPED FRUITS HERE" he went on vending.
</p>
<p>
	"Wow" Demi said laughing. "Guess he really was a DICK Salesman"
</p>
<p>
	Ugla stormed back into her makeshift lab and shook Buffcat awake. He chirped as he woke up.
</p>
<p>
	"BC. I need you to go check out this grove." Ugla held out a crudely drawn map she had jotted down. "This is where they're getting sick from. It has to be"
</p>
<p>
	"MEW MEW" Buffcat shot up and grabbed his axe.
</p>
<p>
	"YEAH LETS GO" Demi said cracking her knuckles.
</p>
<p>
	"NOT you" Ugla replied as she grabbed Demi's Potato sack claok. "I'm not sending a child out into whatever nightmare of the week we got going on around here with penis fruits and humping zombies. NAH UH. You can stay here and help me test these dick fruits for possible clues and cures."
</p>
<p>
	"PFFT NO WAY" Demi said wrenching her cloak away from the wizard. "I'm not gonna sit here for another two days while you weirdly stick things into a dick shaped fruit while Buff Kitty goes out there alone! YOu're not my mother!" Demi shouted.
</p>
<p>
	"You're right I'm not your mother" Ugla said sternly. "But I am the only thing keeping you alive right now kiddo. I brought you into this realm and as soon as I can figure out how to open a time rift, I sure as hell am sending taking you out of it."
</p>
<p>
	Demi sat mouth open in shock. "Nice" she said. "Ya know I know why they call you Ugla now....you may be pretty on the outside but what you just said was the ugliest thing anyone has ever said to me." Demi gave one final whip of her cloak and ran out the door.
</p>
<p>
	"Hey Buff KItty wait up" she shouted.
</p>
<p>
	"Fuck" Ugla said rubbing her temples again. 
</p>
<p>
	"Squib....Squib can you grab me the jar with the....SQUIB?" Ugla looked around. But he too was gone and running after Demi and Buffcat.
</p>
<p>
	"Fuck fuck" Ugla sighed.
</p>
<p>
	"MEWMEW" Buffcat whispered as both Demi and Squib ducked down. Night had fallen over the realm and the tall wheat was perfect camo for Buffcat's orange fur. Not so much for Demi's dark hair and Squib's...well Squib's disgustingly green everything.
</p>
<p>
	The wind again blew through the wheat and it rustled a calming whoooosh. Demi breathed in heavily and thought about how much life there was here. She could feel the life in the earth. She could smell it. Sweet and new and old and musty all at once. 
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" Buffcat pointed to the middle of the field. Demi and Squib squinted to try and see what his cat eyes could clearly see. Ahead Demi could see a few stalks of wheat move. Then a few more and a few more. Whatever it was was in the wheat field hiding just like they were. Demi leaned in willing her eyes to see what Buffcat's could. Without thinking she lost her balance and began to fall face forward. Using his cat reflexes Buffcat reached out and grabbed her. As he did everything turned an electric green. As if Demi was seeing through new eyes. She could see every star in the sky clear as day. She could see every blade of wheat's rhythmic movement as if her instincts knew when and how to move through them. She turned to look at Buffcat who's eyes widened even more at the sight of hers.
</p>
<p>
	"What is..." she began but Buffcat shushed her. She squinted and tried to understand this new sight she had. Then she saw it. 2 great tusks poking out of the wheat in front of her. 
</p>
<p>
	SNORF SNOF its great big piggly nose sniffed and snotted all over Demi's face. That is when Squib let out the highest pitch girly scream ever heard in all of the realm.
</p>
<p>
	"CHEESE IT" Demi said standing up unsheathing her sword. Buffcat was already up however and planted his axe squarely into the boars skull. It let out a screech as it died in horrible pain. 
</p>
<p>
	"THAT WAS MY FOOKIN MOUNT YA BIG PUSSY" a voice shouted from somewhere in the field.
</p>
<p>
	Buffcat looked around but couldn't find the source of the insult.
</p>
<p>
	"OI DOWN HERE YA BIG DUMB ASS LICKIN TWAT" teh voice shouted.
</p>
<p>
	Buffcat looked down to see a rat. But not just any rat. A rat with lance and military style armor.
</p>
<p>
	"Awww look at your cutie little armor and lance" Demi said trying to pick him up. As she did he bit her
</p>
<p>
	"GET OFF ME YA SLAG" he said scurrying away. "GET EM BOYS"
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly thousands of glowing green eyes sparked up in the darkness within the field. Boar mounted rats swiftly ran through the field toward the party making the feral hogs from Russia look like the ferral hogs from Willow.
</p>
<p>
	"KILL HER" The Rat King said wearing golden plated war mask complete with war whiskers. In his hand he held a new gold plated GUN?!?!? Oh no not this guy again.
</p>
<p>
	The rats swarmed as Demi and Buffcat swatted rat after rat. Some rats were cut down while others were stomped on. It was like that scene in saving private ryan but this wasn't D Day this was R Day....for Rat. One rat walked around aimlessly looking for his own arm while another tried to get cover. By now Buffcat had had a taste for blood and was killing rats at levels not seen since the Great Rat Frog Wars. 
</p>
<p>
	"KEEP SPRAYING BOYS" The Rat King said as he waved his tiny arm. All around them rats with what looked like backpacks sprayed out an otherworldly green mist onto the crops. A thick green haze rose from the field covering it in an almost apocolyptic hue.
</p>
<p>
	"SQUIB WE NEED TO GET ONE OF THOSE BACKPACKS" Demi shouted but Squib was already running for his life back to the village.
</p>
<p>
	"FUCK YOU THIS SUCKS" he said as the doppler effect warped his voice.
</p>
<p>
	"HEHEHEHE RUN LITTLE GOBLIN" the Rat King cackled. "RUN BACK TO YOUR FARM, BOY" 
</p>
<p>
	With that something inside Squib snapped.
</p>
<p>
	"Farm.....boy....." he said stopping mid stride. He gripped the dog tags at his chest and turned around as rage filled his tiny green body. If his eyes were cannons they'd have shot lasers white hot and face melting at the Rat King and become laser cannons which are super cool.
</p>
<p>
	Demi brushed Rats from her face and spat out as she was sure some of them were farting on her or doing whatever gross thing rats do. Buffcat was holding his own but his axe and flail tail were not very effective against such small enemies. His Cold Steel Claws ripped through them at an efficient pace but there were just so many rats.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly in a blur, a green rage weasel shot into the field and started tearing up rats left and right. Squib was on all fours and shaking rats to death like dogs do with their toys. One rat flew so high into the hair he did the batman symbol against one of Daranos' moons but instead of batman he was ratman and the song played really quickly in a nice little reference.
</p>
<p>
	When it was all over the Rat King had fled. Daylight again began to peak over the horizon.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew...mew" Buffcat said out of breath.
</p>
<p>
	Squib was curled up in a ball around a whole platoon of dead rat soldiers snoring away.
</p>
<p>
	"Grab all the little tank back packs you can" Demi commanded as she picked up the cute little packs filled with deadly fuck virus.
</p>
<p>
	As they walked back to the village Buffcat patted Demi on the head and gave her a chirp.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah....tell that to UGLY" she said snarkily.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew mew mew mew" Buffcat replied.
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah I know but she doesn't want me here. AND she doesn't want me to help so I dont know fuck her"
</p>
<p>
	"Mew mew mew mew mew mew mew me wmew mew mewmew" BUffcat elaborated. "MEw mew mew mew mewmew" 
</p>
<p>
	"Well I guess" Demi said.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew"
</p>
<p>
	"Yeah I never thought of it like that" Demi relented.
</p>
<p>
	As they re-entered the village Ugla was already awake waiting for them. Demi and Buffcat tossed down a dozen or more little toxin back packs.
</p>
<p>
	"Here is your cure or whatever" Demi said looking away from Ugla.
</p>
<p>
	"Mew" BUffcat encouraged Demi as he gently nudged her forward.
</p>
<p>
	"And...." she went on. "I'm sorry for running off to save the day. And I am sorry for what I said to you it was mean and not at all true or fair"
</p>
<p>
	Ugla just nodded and took one step forward. Demi braced for a reaming out but suddenly felt Ugla wrap her arms around her and squeeze tightly.
</p>
<p>
	"You're ok" is all Ugla said almost in disbelief. Demi slowly raised her hands to hug back. The moment lasted just long enough for it to be broken up by Squib waking up from a night terror yelling "FARM BOY NO FARM BOOOY"
</p>
<p>
	They all laughed. 
</p>
<p>
	"Looks like I'm not the only one who needs therapy" Demi said snarkily......
</p>
<p>
	THE END
</p>
