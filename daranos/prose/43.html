Ep 43

Staves and Baking

The Obake Bukake Sale

 As the dust settled from the short but intense battle, Sid counted his fingers and toes. Yup still 6 each. Chic Pea spun around defensively doing a cool karate stance ready for another attack. Fred groaned and held his head as he sat up from where he was knocked the fuck out like Deebo from Friday. The only sound now in the old abandoned castle was the faint hiss of the dust settling and the groans of Fred's bruised ego.

"I got knocked the fuck out by that brick shit house of a centaured whooty ass havin' dwraf" Fred said spitting some blood and teeth onto the ground.

"Gunk...what an absolute IDIOT" Sid said throwing an old used potion bottle to the ground. All around him he could see evidence of dark magic, regular magic, blood sugar sex magic (the seminal Red Hot Chilli Peppers album), Magik the Gathering, Magic Johnson's Memior entitled 'My Only Regret is that I had Bonitis', and a mysteriously sticky tome entitled Slut Magic: A Guide to Better Glide fo Yo Slip n Slide.

Chic Pea held up the book with two fingers like it were cursed or smelly or both.

"I dont even know what this type of magic is and I've been to some pretty shady AOL chatrooms". She tossed the book away just as it grew wings and flew away.

"Thank you kind wizard for freeing me..." but just as the tome was finishing its gratitude another larger book swooped down and grabbed it with its claws and flew away.

Peppercorn reamerged from outside of the castle and was quickly taking readings with his All See PKE Meter.

"The magical residue in this place is off the charts!" he excalimed as the dial on the PKE meter spiked and boinged out of the device with a cartoonish SPROING sound and the sound of a jallopy sputtering to a stall.

"What the hell was she doing here?" Fred asked stupidly.

"Probably trying to unlock the secrets of the Quantum All See Whatever The Hell It's called." Chic Pea replied.

"That certainly would require a lot of magic..." Peppercorn said taking more readings. "To put it into perspective. Think of the castle here as a, lets say...porn set. And think of all of the magical residue in here as bodily sexual fluids. By my calculations we're talking about a magical disturbance equal to or above 18 bukake units, or simply 'kakes for short."

"We have to warn Ugla and the others in the future..." Sid said while gathering any and all useful potions. Fred grabbed a healing potion and slammed it down. The magical elixer instantly regrew his missing teeth.

"We should be able to follow Princess Crack Spoon's magical signature..." Peppercorn said pulling out another device. "Think of it as if her magical signal were her magical snail trail as it were....and she moving through space time is like her rubbing..."

"ALRIGHT" Chic Pea said putting a hand over his mouth. "Yeah....we got it" Fred said laughing.

"Chic and I can work on leaving a suitable marker for the future people to follow. Until then I suggest we stock up on potions and grenades and get that book of Slut Magic down from that other book in the cieling." Peppercorn said with a distgusting deviant determination.

"I'm gonna need something of Ugla's or something from someone else from that party." Chic Pea said directly to Sid.

"Why would I have something of hers, Chic?" Sid asked squinting his eyes.

"Like, a hair or a toe nail or like something gross you kept and are ashamed of..." Chic Pea said with a wink.

"Yes. I carry a hair doll around of my girlfriend in case I get lonely during heists and need to smell her cocunut scented shampoo to give me more big boy bravery and then at night I replaced it under her pillow so it'd smell like her always and forever..." Sid said specifically.

"I mean...that would work and I feel like since that was very specific that maybe you did do that at one point or still do?" Chic Pea asked.

"I DON'T CHIC. I haven't seen her in ages and I'm getting really tired of this whole time travel different timeline communicating through art like I'm some kind of Liberal Arts major who's dad didn't hug him enough..." Sid sat down frustrated. He felt more alone now than he had in a while. Even leading the Flamingos was no longer enough to keep his mind off of his beloved bearded bad ass bitch.

"WAIT" Fred shouted. "It can be anyone from the future party right?"

"Yeah?" Chic asnwered.

Fred rummaged quickly through his pack and found an old ratty and torn tunic that he had used to his adventures in the desert lands.

"This was Buffcat's favorite hump blanket...I MEAN...sleepy time blanket" He corrected himself with a cough.

"We can't know if Ugla is with Buffcat, Fred" Sid said dejectedly.

"I heard him! In the background of that communication I heard a cat man say 'mew mewmew (oh my gods). It had to be him!"

"It's worth a shot I guess" Chic said as she tweezed off a few orange cat hairs from the hump blanket I MEAN sleeping blanket.

2 HOURS LATER

"Ok we've left the marker" Peppercorn said out of breath.

"It should compensate for the ravages of time and make sure that only those from the future party will see it and junk" Chic said.

Sid and Fred looked up at the gigantic marker that now towered over them on one of the exterior walls of the ancient castle. Before them stood a screeching flamingo in the style of those only found on late 1970's Pontiac Trans Ams. On it's crotchel region was an erect donger in the shape of an arrow with a tattoo on it that said "THIS WAY" with the winky face emoji. Above the donger, the flamingos pubes were trimmed into a COOL S.

"I think this should be our permenant logo" Chic Pea said laughing.

"Why...did you give the bird a cool S landing strip though?" Fred asked nervously.

"Doesn't everyone shave theirs into a cool S?" Peppercorn asked looking down his own trousers at his other work of art.

"You're rapidly like becoming a characature of yourself you know that right?" Chic pea said wile looking at an all see ball page of patreon.com/storylords as the pledges began to fall into the negative numbers faster than building 7 was demolished after 9-11 do your own research.

--------------------

"Tell me what the actual fucking fuck I am looking at?" Squib said crooking his head from one side to another. Before them stood a giant castle wall which had been devasted by 1000 years of dust storms, sieges, and graffiti. Apparently the people of Daranos had taken Peppercorns first attempt at art to heart and began a 1000 year tradition adding their own dongers to the castle wall. It was now covered in dicks. Some Daranosian historians even began to call Peppercorn "Wanksy" and dub him one of Daranos's greatest artists of all time.

"Mew mew mew mewmew (thats a lot dicks)" Buffcat said.

"It sure is buddy" Demi said letting out a long whistle.

Ugla moved over to the wall and began to feel around for anything out of the ordinary.

"yeah....really get up in there hehe" Squib laughed.

"I think you missed a spot over by that big black one!" Demi chided.

"Mew! Mew mew mew (yeah use both hands)" Buffcat laughed.

Ugla shot back a look over her shoulder and everyone stopped laughing...until she turned around again and they each giggled again.

"There's the spot" Ugla said without a hint of irony.

Suddenly a magical figure began to form. A figure that stood only about 3 feet tall and was chewing some kind of bubble candy.

"Like...answer these riddles 3 or whatever" Said the magical figure.

"Ooooo a tulpa" Demi said reading out of one of Ugla's magical books.

"More like pre-recorded magical voice mail" Ugla corrected.

"Speak for yourself ya big bitch! I'm very much sentient and am my own woman" The Chic Pea Tulpa replied with a sassy snap. "I was kidding about the riddles though you just should just go west. Keep on straight toward the triple star up there....unless it's day time now in which case just wait until night and do that...."

All at once the flamingo firebird began to burn its way to the front of all the other phalic art much like your mother's herpes burned all the way to the forefront of my phalic piece of art. Much like her scorching viral vag graffiti, the flamingo burned brightly and hot erasing all other marks on the wall. There it stood in all its glory with its arrow shaped dingus pointing the way for the adventure to continue.

"My brother needed an outlet for his 'art" Chic Tulpa said. 

"ITS OUR NEW LOGO" Peppercorn could be heard saying in the background.

"Wait...so are you real or is this a recording?" Ugla asked very confused.

"I dont know...like does it matter? Who cares? Just do a cut to here and get on withthe story" Chic Tulpa said as it disappared...or didn't. I don't know or care.

CUT TO

Many hours and many steps later Ugla and the gang found themselves in a deep wooded area. The trees themselves were long dead. They were burned or died of some sort of tree disease. Night was closing in and all around were the sounds of scary night time animals. A skeletel mirkmonk was putting his skeletal son to bed early so he could felate his skeletal mirkmonk wife. But in the distance Buffcat could see the dull glow of a candle or torch burning.

"Mew. Mewmwe" he said pointing.

"Could be people...or someone who knows something about where we might need to go?" Demi said with a hopeful tone.

"We should go look for sure" Ugla said picking up her pack again.

"Should we leave bread crumbs for the future group to follow so they know we went this way?" Squib asked.

"Dude what?" Demi said with a laugh. "WE are the future group. Have you not been paying attention?"

"Not really" Squib said picking up a stick and pretending it was a sword.

After a short walk the group reached a perfectly pristine cottage in the middle of the desolate burnt out woods. I mean Smokey the Bear wouldn't take a shit in this dump. But there, in the middle of all this destruction and barrenness, stood a fucking perfectly painted and maintained tiny little cottage looking polly pocket as fuck.

"This is weird as heck..." Demi said running a hand over the blooming roses and daises growing out of box by a window. She cupped her hands to look in.

"Demi....DON'T" Ugla scolded.

"GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASP" Demi gasped. "OH MY GOLDEN UNDERTHINGS!" She shouted. She turned around with her mouth wide open with a smile. "GUYS!" she said.

Just then a tiny litle gnome burst out of the front door.

"GREETINGS HUMANS AND WHATEVER THESE OTHER THINGS ARE!" he said with a smile. He then did the macarena for no reason and spun around on one foot holding his hands out like jazz hands waiting for applaus.

Demi and Squib obliged as they softly golf clapped.

"Welcome welcome come in and enjoy for you have just discovered QUIZNO'S BAKERY AND FINE MEATS" again the gnome did the electric slide and the jazz hands thing again.

"Wait...Quiznos?" Ugla said. "Are we...I MEAN YOU gonna get sued for that?"

"Pretty sure htey went out of business a long time ago even though they had that funny all see ballmercial ...'WE GOT THE BREADS' or whatever it was" Quizno said with a laugh. "Now come in and eat. You all look famished."

"I'm 100% into this and have no further suspicions whatsoever" Squib said throwing his stick to the side and walking into the cottege. 

Inside the cottage was larger on the inside than it was on the outside. Just like your mother because after I bored out her pleasure mine last night I'm pretty sure you could fit all of NORAD in there or at least some hidden stolen art, right Rich? Or should I say, 'Right, Richler?"

On the tables were muffins, cakes, succulent meats, cream puffs, creampies like the one I gave your whore mother last night, and many many more delicious looking foods.

"This is Spirited Away as fuuuuuuuuck" Demi said picking up a small cookie (that's BISCUIT for you Rich) and gently biting into it. Her eyes lit up as the flavor of vanilla and almond hit her tongue. Flavors she had never before tasted and couldn't imagine in those short years she's been alive.

"Good isn't it little human sidekick?" Quizno said rubbing his hands together.

"This is AMAZING!" she said grabbing a handfull and stuffing them into her pockets like she was at a Duke and Duke Christmas party.

"How about you tall human...err...what is your name again?" Quizno asked.

"Ugla...Ugla the Wizard" She said slowly grabbing a piece of mana bread and sniffing it.

"Yes...yessssss I remember you now......" Quizno said with a smirk.

---------------------

"OH MY GOD THIS TRIP IS SO BORING!" Chic Pea said as she slouched down onto a tree stump. All around here were verdant green trees. The life of the forest was filling her tiny ear holes with a cacophony of chirps and squeaks and chitters.

"May as well rest here for the night" Sid said throwing down his own pack.

"We can find shelter in this cave if it begins to rain" Fred said shining his torch into a small wet cave that resembled your mother's crotch cave after I filled it old paintings and jizz last night.

Suddenly a small but audible little girl laughed echoed from the cave.

"NOPE" Fred said as he stepped away and cracked his knuckles ready for a fight.

"TEE HEE HEE" the sound of hte girl was now louder.

Sid sighed. "FIIIIIIIIIINE" he said standing up and grabbing Socks. "Peppercorn you stay out here with Freddo and watch our stuff. If we're not back in 10 minutes come rescue us"

Chic Pea grabbed her staff and blew out a loud crackling bubble. "Lets fuck this cave with our dicks" she said like a baddass.

The cave dripped moisture from its various stalactites and mites as Chic Pea and Sid crept through the ever more narrow tunnels. Even Chic  Pea had to duck occasionally to get into the next cavern. Finally they reached....a cottage?

"What in the Alice In Wonderland fuck is this shit?" SId said. The cottage looked warped. Like it couldn't maintain its shape. Soon the outer wall fell away to reveal a room full of weirdly shaped foods. Warped wraps and misshapen Muffins. Distorted donuts and squiggly sweets.

"WelCOme to My BAkery" said a disfigured...thing from the cottage. There in front of them stood a mishapen horror. It stretched itself and ungulated back into itlself like I ungulated back into your mother last night as we already went over. It's face kept changing and it could barely speak.

"Its an OBAKE!" Chic said readying her staff.

"Welcome to MY....OBAKERY" the shapeshifter said laughing maniacly.

"Ok this things needs to die now" Sid said rubbing his nose. Without warning the Obake lunged it neck forward and transformed its head into a wolf head. It snapped at Sid but he was agile as fuck. He dodged just as Chic Pea shouted magical power words that imbued her staff with flames. She struck down on the wolves snoot as it whined and hissed backward. Sid rolled and unsheathed socks who glowed with blue power. The Obake again lurched forward and transformed one of its many tentacle like arms into a giant fly swatter and swatted direclty down onto Chic Pea.

She raised a shield just in time but the impact still took a lot of out her.

"LITtle FLY creaTURE You DIE NOW" the Obake wheezed. Sid was already on top of it htough and swung socks downward cutting off the tentacled fly swatter. The apendage slitthered and writhed on teh ground now free of its amorphous master. The Obake just laughed. And with a final more concerted effort formed itself into a huge black mass that began to cover every square inch of the cavern. Chic Pea grabbed Sid and pulled him close as he shield spell buckled and cracked under the pressure of this BBC (Big Black Cloud). Finally the the shield ruptured as Sid and Chic groaned in pain. Sid held Socks tightly in his grip as the mass engulfed him. Finally, he let go of Socks as Sock too now was being crushed by the weight of the BBC.

"MEEEEEOOOWW" Socks screamed as his magic was now being siphoned into the void along with Sid and Chic Pea.

"Ugla.....help.....me...." were Sid's last words

-------------------

"HISSSSSS" suddenly Sandles zooped out of staff form and began to hiss at Quizno feircly. 

"Hehe good kitty cAT" Quizno said as his voice cracked. 

Sandles lunged at Quizno slicing his face open with her sharp kitty claws.

"InsoLENT RoDENt" Quizno said changing shape for a moment before reforming back into Quizno.

"What the hell was that shit?" Demi said through a mouth full of cookies.

Buffcat wolverined out his claws and was now growling menacingly at Quizno.

It was too late though. Quizno was already forming and reforming himself into any and all terrifying objects and monsters.

"An Obake..." Ugla said doing a karate pose ready to strike.

"YouR Friends....DELIcious....they Were" Quizno said as he belched up 4 skeletons. 2 gnomes, a big human, and a troll.

"Sid....no...." Ugla almost screamed in terror and grief. Next to them lay the skeleton of a small cat. Socks.

Sandles saw this and immediately went bat shit insane. She hissed and began to glow a powerful blue. The room shook. She began to syphon energy from the Obake itself and with every burst of energy she grew. She grew until she was the size of a dire wolf. Her hair glowed blue with power as she growled deeply and gutterally.

"Mew mew mew mew  mew" Buffcat said witha  smile.

She lashed her claws at the Obake. WIth each strike she drew more power from the monster. Finally she let out a primortial screech that caused Squib's ears to bleed green blood. He covered them and fell to the floor in a fetal position.

---------------------

Sock's lifeless body lay on its side. His little green eyes were shut forever. Suddenly a blue glow surrounded him as his eyes shot open.

"MEEEEEOOOOWWWWWW" He screamed as life surged back into his body. A single white streak of fur burned its way across his tiny cute forhead in the shape of 3 claw marks. Soon he too was growing to the size of a dire wolf. The younger Obake couldn't do anything but watch as Socks slashed his way free of the black mass digesting him and his friends. Sid gasped back to life as Socks uncovered his face with a deadly flash of claws. Chic Pea coughed up some black blork and used her staff to steady herself.

"Whoaaaa" she said as she saw Socks dismembering the Obake.

-----------------

Sandle's too was slashing and hacking hte Obake up. It was now weaker and weaker and parts of it began to disappear like my virginity after Prom Junior Year when I won Best Hair.

WItha  final slash Socks destroyed the Obake. And just as quickly as his transformation into a giant battle cat-esque death machine had happened he was now just a tiny little black cute cat lickin his paw clean of vicera and slime like nothing out of hte ordinary had happened. The only difference now was the white fur slash marks across his face.

"Socks....that was the most metal ass fucking shit I have ever seen and I saw Wife Bones at the Public Library protesting the banning of Trans Books while slowly burning nazi's and cops to death with guitar solo powers" Sid said picking up his cat and hugging him. Sid rubbed his hand over Sock's white marks and looked at Chic Pea inquisitivly.

"Beats me dude" She said shaking her head.

Socks just licked Sid's hand.

--------------

The Obake in the future writhed and withered until it disappeared along with the food and the skeletons of Sid, Fred, and the 2 gnomes.

"What the fuck was that?" Ugla said to Sandles who was now again just a regular cat but, much like Socks, now had 3 black claw marks on her face.

Ugla picked her up and hugged her. 

"You get all of Squib's treats later yes you do sweet baby girl yes you do baby baby baby girl" Ugla said kissing her cat.

"Heeeeey" Squib said sulking.

"So...if we killed the Obake here in the future how did it die in the past?" Demi said thinking with her fingers.

"Mew. Mew mew mew mew mewmewmew. MEW MEW mewmewmewmewmewm" Buffcat explained perfectly.

"Oh yeah I guess that makes sense, Thanks BC" Demi said hugging him

THE END
