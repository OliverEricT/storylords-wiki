Storylords is an comedy storytelling podcast where three hilarious podcast boys - [[hosts:RichMasters|Rich Masters]], [[hosts:JoshHenderson|Josh Henderson]], and [[hosts:JeffPennington|Jeff Pennington]] - create stories based on audience prompts every two weeks in three separate pulp genres! Think of it as an audio anthology book!
</p>
<p>
Rich creates hilarious but poignant and lore-driven tales of Sci-Fi set within his original universe [[omniverse:Omniverse|The Omniverse]] populated by technocratic despots, gritty cyborg heroes, and a guy coincidentally named [[omniverse:LionelRichie|Lionel Richie]] who's in love with his watch. These stories of action, adventure, intrigue, and unfolding mystery will keep you glued to the edge of your seat as each new character is folded into the quest to topple the tyrannical and seemingly unstoppable [[omniverse:Technomancer]], but you'll never stop laughing yourself to tears along the way thanks to the trademark English wit that's injected deep into the veins of every star-spanning tale.

Josh has brought his own expansive original Fantasy universe [[daranos:Daranos]] back from his previous podcast [[deepKnowledge:FantasyFiction|Fantasy Fiction]] and has both re-ignited the fires of old characters and locations as well as given mind-birth to brand new heroes and tales that eclipse any he's told before! If you love hyper sexual Orcs with incalculable dongers, endless hilarious mentions of every kinda sexual act you can imagine, and a genuinely surprising amount of heart behind it all, then these tales are for you!
</p>
<p>
Jeff brings a touch of terror to the podcast with heart-stopping Horror stories brought to you in [[spookyvision:Spookyvision]], from one-offs about witches in the woods killing inexplicably cowboy-themed teens all the way to an expanding universe of tales all based around the hidden secret of the [[spookyvision:BloodMoon|Blood Moon]]. His tales range from slasher, to body horror, all the way up to eldritch end-of-the-world horror the likes of which you've never heard before - all wrapped up with a degenerate P.I. that every listener loves to hate deeply, and openly, because of who he is as a person.
